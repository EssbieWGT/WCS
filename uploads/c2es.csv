Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements.
The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.
“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release.
“Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.” The appeal from environmental groups was filed Oct. 3.","Environmental groups are appealing a federal court’s decision to uphold a rule exempting livestock and poultry operations from reporting significant releases of air pollutants.

The environmental groups allege the rule is unlawful and that exposure to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from these operations is responsible for more deaths annually than exposure to air pollution from coal plants.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which intervened in the case, celebrated the court ruling in its favor and said the rules were “onerous and unnecessary” by requiring producers to file “complex, overreaching reports.”

In August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the environmental groups’ request for summary judgment and instead granted judgment on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Cattlemen.

EPCRA and CERCLA

Two laws are at play in the case. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, which require certain entities to notify EPA and local officials of a “potentially dangerous” release of a hazardous substance, according to EPA.

EPA has attempted to change the rule, as it relates to animal waste at farms, in the past, according to the court’s filed memorandum of opinion. Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements.

In 2019, EPA filed a final rule to exempt animal waste emissions from EPCRA requirements in order to match the regulations to the recently changed CERCLA rules.

The environmental groups alleged EPA relied “unlawfully” on the congressional changes to CERCLA as justification for changing the rules in EPCRA that let “the industrial animal industry off the hook.”

The opinion from U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly said the EPA rule was “consistent with the best reading” of EPRCA regulations and provides an explanation for exempting animal waste air emissions.

Kelly wrote that to remain consistent with statutory text, EPA had “no leeway to consider the public’s right to access information” and “no discretion to consider environmental effects” when issuing the 2019 rule.

Environmental groups say reporting requirements protect communities

In a joint news release about the decision to appeal the federal court’s decision, the environmental groups said the pollution reporting requirements at hand “are designed to guarantee that communities and emergency responders have access to information necessary to protect themselves from harmful exposure to these extremely hazardous substances.”

A recent peer-reviewed study from the University Michigan found that communities with the highest concentrations of animal feeding operations, like cattle feedlots, dairy farms and hog farms, have elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter.

According to the study, fine particulate matter was 28% higher in census tracts with high concentrations of cattle feeding operations and 11% higher in census tracts with hog farms.

The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.

Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney at Waterkeeper Alliance, said people have a “right to know” when hazardous air pollution is released near their homes, schools or work.

“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release. “Its mandate is to protect human health and the environment, not to create loopholes that allow polluters to hide the truth and put communities and ecosystems at risk.”

In a news release about the court’s opinion, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said EPCRA and CERCLA regulations were intended to address “massive, severe” environmental contaminants and chemical spills. Instead, the association said, the laws were “weaponized” by animal rights groups targeting “family farms and ranchers.”

Kaitlynn Glover, the association’s executive director of natural resources, said the environmental laws should not “govern” cattle farmers.

“This decision affirms that family cattle producers should not have to file reports for a natural, biological process under a law meant for significant chemical contaminants,” Glover said in the release. “NCBA stepped up to protect family farms and ranches through this litigation and we are pleased that the federal district court has brought clarity to this decades-long discussion.”

Tarah Heinzen, the legal director for the involved environmental group Food & Water Watch, said the Trump Administration’s “see no evil approach will not stand in court.”

“Trump’s EPA is suppressing critical pollution data required to keep frontline communities safe and hold polluters accountable,” Heinzen said in the release. “Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.”

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, follows a slump in Tesla sales covering most of the past year due to anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company. The company is also offering a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $35,000.

The company is under intense pressure to lift sales but is facing big challenges. In addition to anti-Musk backlash, it is contending with a likely hit to demand after a federal tax credit worth as $7,500 for EV purchases expired at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell more than 2.5% to $441.08 in late afternoon trading Tuesday. It had closed Monday up more than 5% after the company teased fans with cryptic postings on social media about an imminent product announcement.

The stock has been trading near all-time highs even though both sales and profits have plunged in recent quarters.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

The new Model 3 has also cut down on the driving range, ambient lighting and other features.

News that Entergy was set to power Meta’s flagship 2GW “Hyperion” data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, first broke late last year.
To power the data center, Entergy plans to construct three gas-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.26GW.
To serve the data center, Entergy will build several new transmission lines, including a $1.2 billion 100-mile 500kV project, slated for completion in December 2026.
According to Data Center Map, it has 23 operational facilities.","“We’re seeing interest in things as small as 100-plus megawatts all the way up to gigawatt-scale projects,” he said to Bloomberg. The company is engaged with a “fairly robust pipeline of other hyperscalers.” According to the utility, the interest is based on the region's ample land access, a willing government, and reduced hurricane risk compared to the Gulf Coast.

At present, Entergy, which supplies power to customers across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, has a data center pipeline of between five to 10GW. According to May, the utility is confident that it can meet the power demands of any interested hyperscaler. “As I like to say, ‘Use all you want, we’ll make more,’” he said.

News that Entergy was set to power Meta’s flagship 2GW “Hyperion” data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, first broke late last year. The campus is planned for construction on 2,250 acres between the municipalities of Rayville and Delhi, about 30 miles (48.2km) east of Monroe. Renderings of the campus suggest up to nine buildings are being planned, with construction expected to be completed in phases through 2030.

To power the data center, Entergy plans to construct three gas-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.26GW. The utility obtained approval to construct the facilities from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August.

Two of the units are expected to come online in 2028, with the third facility, built at Entergy Louisiana's existing Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, expected to commence operations in late 2029.

To serve the data center, Entergy will build several new transmission lines, including a $1.2 billion 100-mile 500kV project, slated for completion in December 2026. In addition, the utility will construct two substations, six customer-owned substations, and eight new 230kV transmission lines.

In June, the utility broke ground on the first substation. The Smalling Substation is being constructed in Richland Parish and will be entirely funded by Meta. When completed, it will span 55 acres and connect to high-voltage power lines that bring energy from across the region and deliver it to the Meta site. Meta has offered to offset most of the costs for Entergy's customers, with the company set to pay the full annual revenue for the plants for 15 years.

However, the project has faced opposition, with environmental groups arguing that Entergy did not follow the correct procedure when proposing the new gas-fired plants, which could result in significant costs for ratepayers.

At present, Louisiana is a relatively small data center market. According to Data Center Map, it has 23 operational facilities. However, due to the sector's growth, the state has increasingly positioned itself as a potential hub for large AI-focused facilities.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/GettyImages-1986221985.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:06:29.943612

In certain states with additional incentives (like New York), buyers may see even lower prices, with the Model 3 Standard potentially dropping to $34,990 and the Model Y Standard to $37,990.
Meanwhile, the Model Y Standard comes with a slightly stronger 300-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and matches the same 321-mile estimated range.
For example, the Model Y Standard features a redesigned front look, smaller 18-inch wheels, and a simplified interior with cloth seats and manual seat adjustments.
Actually, the monthly lease for the Model Y increased to $529–$599, while Model 3 lease rates grew to $429–$759 to offset the loss of federal subsidies.","With the US ending tax benefits for electric cars, Tesla has launched more affordable versions of two of its most popular electric vehicles, the Model Y and Model 3, introducing the new ‘Standard’ models. In the United States, the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990 (~ 10% less expensive than the prior base model), while the Model 3 Standard begins at $36,990. In certain states with additional incentives (like New York), buyers may see even lower prices, with the Model 3 Standard potentially dropping to $34,990 and the Model Y Standard to $37,990. These models come after the federal $7,500 EV tax credit expired.

Despite the lower price tags, the company claims that the new Model 3 and Model Y retain strong performance and an impressive driving range. The Model 3 Standard is powered by a 286-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and offers an estimated range of 321 miles on a single charge when equipped with 18-inch wheels. Meanwhile, the Model Y Standard comes with a slightly stronger 300-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and matches the same 321-mile estimated range. Both vehicles use a 69.5 kWh battery pack and can charge at a maximum rate of 225 kW using Tesla’s Supercharger network.

However, to reach these lower prices, the Elon Musk-led EV giant has made several design and feature adjustments. For example, the Model Y Standard features a redesigned front look, smaller 18-inch wheels, and a simplified interior with cloth seats and manual seat adjustments. It also replaces the panoramic glass roof found in higher-priced models with a more standard closed roof. From a production point of view, the new Model Y is about 20% cheaper to make than the previous version, with the company expected to produce around 250,000 units annually in the US by 2026. Also, the Model 3 Standard has undergone similar changes, with some updates to the interior and exterior to keep costs down while maintaining the car’s core performance and range.

The timing of this launch is closely linked to the recent expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025. The change has already affected Tesla customers, with lease prices increasing by up to $120 per month for older models. Actually, the monthly lease for the Model Y increased to $529–$599, while Model 3 lease rates grew to $429–$759 to offset the loss of federal subsidies.

This latest effort becomes even more critical for the company, as it is facing a challenging year. Its stock has fallen about 25% since early 2025, with Q1 profits dropping 71% to $19.3 billion in revenue, and Q2 deliveries falling 13% to 384,122 vehicles. The company, which recently revealed a potential $1 trillion payout for Elon Musk, is continuing to face significant legal scrutiny. Tesla was recently sued by the family of a teenager killed in a crash involving the Cybertruck door design. Last month, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also launched a preliminary investigation into 174,000 Tesla Model Y cars from 2021 due to reported issues with their electronic door handles.",https://thetechportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tesla-new-model-y.webp,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:19.733396

With DOE’s investment and DOI’s leasing action, that foundation just got stronger.
Thank you for choosing reliability over rhetoric, production over pretense, and American energy over dependence.
Emily Arthun is President & CEO of the American Coal Council.","Every so often Washington makes a decision that isn’t about political buzzwords or rhetoric, instead it’s about whether the lights stay on and whether a paystub shows up on a Friday. This is one of those moments. The Department of Energy’s $625 million commitment to reinvigorate America’s coal fleet, paired with the Department of the Interior’s decision to open 13.1 million acres for coal leasing while streamlining approvals and right-sizing royalties, tells the country—plainly—that reliable, affordable, plentiful power is back at the center of national policy. On behalf of producers, transporters, suppliers, utilities, and the hundreds of thousands of men and women whose craft keeps America powered, the American Coal Council says: thank you.

For years, we were told that “something else” would seamlessly replace baseload power. But reality is a stubborn thing, and peak demand is unforgiving. During unrelenting summer heat or frigid winter snaps hard, press releases don’t turn turbines and hashtags don’t boil water. Actual baseload megawatts do. The Department of Energy’s investment recognizes this truth. By directing $350 million to recommission and retrofit coal units, DOE is turning near-term reliability from a talking point into dispatchable capacity. By targeting rural affordability and flexibility—funding wastewater upgrades that extend plant life and co-firing options that add operational agility, DOE is giving operators the tools they need to perform when the grid needs them most. This is not theory. It is steel, wire, boilers, and crews—standing ready at 6 p.m. on a windless January evening and at 3 p.m. on a hot August weekday when factories and data centers are pulling hard.

Interior’s action is the complementary half of the same common-sense equation. Power plants cannot run on optimism; they run on fuel secured through lawful leases, workable permits, and predictable timelines. Opening 13.1 million acres for coal leasing, guided by Executive Orders 14261 and 14241, moves coal from the “constrained input” column to the “accessible resource” column—exactly where it belongs in a nation intent on reindustrialization. When Secretary Doug Burgum signed the policy initiative to expand leasing, reduce the royalty rate to a market reality of 7%, and cut red tape on reviews, he sent an unmistakable message: we will produce energy here at home, with American workers and American standards, and we will do it on a schedule that aligns with real-world demand.

This is energy policy that respects the American worker. From Freedom and Falkirk in North Dakota to expansions at Warrior Met, Skyline, Spring Creek, and West Antelope III, Interior’s leasing posture translates into shifts on the mine plan, trains on the rail, barges on the river, and megawatts on the wire. It also translates into the morning routines of families whose livelihoods depend on this industry: lunches packed on a kitchen counter, kids on a bus, a mortgage paid, a pew filled on Sunday. When Washington gets energy right, it strengthens the very communities that anchor this country.

The administration’s emphasis on recovering critical minerals from mine waste is another example of practical stewardship. Through Secretary’s Order 3436, Interior’s push—with USGS and state partners—to map deposits and fast-track projects for uranium, zinc, germanium, tellurium, and rare earths recognizes that the future of defense, manufacturing, and energy security runs through American resourcefulness. Coal communities know the terrain, the geology, and the logistics better than anyone. Enlisting their expertise to extract additional value from legacy sites turns yesterday’s tailings into tomorrow’s strategic inputs—and it does so while remediating lands with the people who know them best.

We also welcome the clarity and regulatory certainty that come with streamlining approvals. Energy projects fail not because they are impossible but because the calendar gets weaponized. A maintenance upgrade that should take months becomes a multi-year odyssey; a routine expansion sinks under the weight of duplicative reviews and shifting standards. Interior’s move to accelerate leasing decisions and use commonsense approaches under NEPA is not a “giveaway.” It is an admission that the public interest is not served by paralysis. The public interest is served by good projects built well, observed by real inspectors, and delivered on time.

DOE’s investment framework mirrors that realism. Funding for wastewater systems is not glamorous, but it is the difference between a plant that limps toward retirement and a plant that earns another decade of dependable service. Support for dual-fuel retrofits and natural-gas co-firing does not “replace” coal; it gives operators the flexibility to meet the moment without walking away from the backbone of baseload. In short, the Department’s program honors the craft of the people who run these plants—the engineers who balance heat rates and emissions profiles, the maintenance crews who crawl boilers in August, the operators who manage frequency and voltage when the grid sways.

Americans have learned, the hard way, that you can’t command the weather, you can’t legislate inertia, and you cannot build an AI economy on wishful thinking. Algorithms sleep when the power fails. Semiconductor furnaces do not “wait” for wind. Hospitals cannot postpone a January night. The choice before us was never “old versus new.” It was “real versus rhetorical.” By aligning leasing, permitting, and investment with the grid we actually live on, DOI and DOE choose the real. That choice protects consumers from spiraling bills and rolling blackouts. It protects industry from the whiplash of scarcity pricing and curtailments. And it protects national security by anchoring energy in American hands.

To the men and women in hard hats and coveralls who make this all work: today’s actions are an affirmation of your place in America’s future. Miners in the high plains and the hollows, dispatchers in control rooms, electricians and mechanics who keep the systems tight and true—you have been told for a decade that you are the past. The truth is simpler: you are essential. You were essential when polar air snapped pipelines and coal carried the load. You were essential when a summer heat wave pushed reserve margins thin and coal units stood up and took the weight. You will be essential tomorrow as we build steel, pour concrete, and power the data centers that will define the next economy.

To our partners across the value chain—railroads and barge lines, port operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, and utilities—these decisions offer something we have been missing: predictability. Predictability is the hidden currency of capital planning. It lets a mine invest in a new section, a plant invest in a turbine overhaul, a utility file an integrated resource plan that treats firm power as more than a contingency. Predictability also strengthens environmental performance, because operators can adopt better technology on a timetable that makes sense instead of on a roulette wheel of delays and litigation.

We are grateful to Secretary Burgum and the Department of the Interior for opening the acreage, restoring competitiveness through a fair royalty rate, and cutting through the procedural fog that too often chokes good projects. We are grateful to Secretary Chris Wright and the Department of Energy for funding the practical, near-term upgrades that translate into reliability and affordability for families and businesses. And we appreciate the complementary work by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and DOE Undersecretary P. Wells Griffith to align policy across agencies so that producers, utilities, and communities get one clear message: America intends to produce energy—responsibly, abundantly, and at home.

The American Coal Council believes in an “all-that-works” strategy that earns its keep. Coal has carried the baseload for generations because it is engineered to do so—because it is stockpiled on site, resistant to weather shocks, and dispatchable when it counts. That truth does not erase other sources; it anchors them. It provides the firm foundation on which innovation stands. With DOE’s investment and DOI’s leasing action, that foundation just got stronger.

We measure policy not by the decibels of its announcement but by the steadiness of its results: bills that don’t wreck a family budget, factories that don’t idle on hot afternoons, winter nights that pass without incident, and small towns that hum with work. By that measure, these decisions are wins—wins for consumers, for workers, for national security, and for an American future that builds instead of imports, that competes instead of concedes, that keeps faith with the people who make and move the power that keeps us free.

So yes—thank you. Thank you for choosing reliability over rhetoric, production over pretense, and American energy over dependence. Now let’s get to work.

Chairman John Elkann has reportedly met with President Trump to discuss U.S. manufacturing commitments, including plans for a new midsize pickup — potentially bound for Belvidere.
Shifting some production back to the U.S. would not only mitigate that risk but also strengthen Stellantis’ “Made in America” image.
While the exact projects remain under review, one thing is clear — Stellantis is preparing to double down on its American roots.
A major U.S. investment plan could mark the start of a new chapter for one of Detroit’s most storied automakers.","Stellantis is reportedly preparing a massive $10 billion investment plan, with a focus squarely on the United States — its most profitable and strategically vital market.

According to multiple reports, the automaker may soon announce about $5 billion in new investments, adding to a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year. The plan would target key manufacturing states, such as Michigan and Illinois, signaling a renewed commitment to domestic production, job creation, and product expansion after years of focusing on lower-cost markets.

Rebuilding the American Core –

Under CEO Antonio Filosa, who took over in May, Stellantis appears to be recalibrating its strategy to rebuild brand strength in the U.S. and reestablish its industrial footprint. The company is expected to channel the funds into reopening plants, launching new models, and expanding its workforce. The Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which has been idle since February 2023, is said to play a central role, with Stellantis already pledging to return roughly 1,500 employees to work there.

Filosa’s approach contrasts with that of former CEO Carlos Tavares, who aggressively relocated production and engineering operations to cost-efficient regions, such as Mexico, and heavily invested in Europe, where profitability remains weaker. Filosa’s new roadmap appears to prioritize the U.S., where demand for trucks, SUVs, and muscle cars continues to drive profits.

Reviving Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep® –

Sources indicate that Stellantis is intent on revitalizing the Jeep® brand — long considered the company’s crown jewel in America — after recent declines in market share. The Dodge brand could also see renewed attention, with whispers suggesting potential investment in a new HEMI®-powered Dodge Charger model to complement the all-electric Charger Daytona and upcoming twin-turbo HURRICANE Dodge Charger SIXPACK cars. Meanwhile, Chrysler may receive long-overdue product expansion, a move previously hinted at by CEO Christine Feuell at the Chrysler Carlisle Nationals earlier this year.

If realized, these efforts could reinvigorate Stellantis’ reputation among American consumers and restore confidence in the automaker’s domestic operations.

Political and Economic Timing –

The timing of this investment wave also aligns with broader industry trends. With President Donald Trump’s administration incentivizing U.S. manufacturing and threatening steep tariffs on imported vehicles, Stellantis’ move could help curry favor with the administration while safeguarding its North American supply chain.

Chairman John Elkann has reportedly met with President Trump to discuss U.S. manufacturing commitments, including plans for a new midsize pickup — potentially bound for Belvidere. That vehicle would likely compete in a red-hot segment dominated by the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.

Navigating Tariff Risks –

Stellantis is reportedly lobbying the government to ease proposed 25% tariffs that could impact its Ram Heavy Duty pickups, currently built in Mexico. Shifting some production back to the U.S. would not only mitigate that risk but also strengthen Stellantis’ “Made in America” image.

While the exact projects remain under review, one thing is clear — Stellantis is preparing to double down on its American roots. A major U.S. investment plan could mark the start of a new chapter for one of Detroit’s most storied automakers.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BU024_039FA.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 17:05:28.205061

The program marks a milestone for distributed power plants in America, demonstrating how large EV batteries can stabilize the grid, provide backup power to homes, and lower overall energy costs.
“Enabling customers to not only power their homes, but send power directly back to the grid in times of need, helps customers with financial incentives, utilities with more power capacity, and society through more grid reliability and sustainable energy practices.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Or, in this case, three pickup trucks.

Sunrun, the largest provider of residential solar, battery energy storage, and home-to-grid power plants in the United States, has activated the nation’s first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) distributed power plant in partnership with Maryland’s largest utility, Exelon subsidiary Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE).

Starting in July, enrolled Ford F-150 Lightning trucks (yes, all three!) dispatched energy to the grid during peak summer demand hours from 5 to 9 p.m. on weekdays. Participating customers received a payment based on the amount of energy shared, up to a maximum of $1,000 for the ‘dispatching season,’ which ran through the end of September.

“This demonstrates the critical role that vehicle batteries can play in powering the nation’s grid, accelerating American energy independence and dominance. It’s great to see our partnership with BGE and Ford move to this commercial stage,” observed Sunrun CEO Mary Powell. “In addition to showing how electric vehicles (EVs) can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers.”

While certainly small to start and slow to progress, the pilot promises incredible potential, as Powell recognizes, and could represent the future of resiliency, both for homeowners and electric utilities.

How We Got Here

BGE was awarded grant funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to create an EV virtual power plant (VPP) and partnered with Sunrun to develop and administer the program. Their partnership launched last summer with vehicle-to-home (V2H) capability, a less-complicated function than sharing stored energy with the local grid.

“This program is a significant proof of concept — no other market player has done this — and the goal is to expand these programs all around the country,” said Powell at the time. “This exciting partnership lays the foundation for the power grid of the future, where electric vehicle owners can contribute to grid resiliency and utility price stability for everyone.”

In June, Maryland’s Public Service Commission unanimously voted to adopt a comprehensive suite of V2G interconnection rules, becoming the first state to do so and paving the way for broader adoption. The rules were established by the Vehicle-Grid Integration Council (VGIC), an advocacy group dedicated to advancing EVs and associated technologies, including smart charging.

This summer, Ford and Sunrun pushed the envelope further in the name of pioneering V2G energy dispatch, activating the nation’s first residential bidirectional EV distributed power plant. Using the tandem’s co-developed Home Integration System, pilot participants sent energy from their all-electric pickup truck batteries to their homes and the grid. When paired with the Home Integration System and Sunrun’s Charge Station Pro, Ford’s F-150 Lightning can deliver up to 9.6 kW of power.

The program marks a milestone for distributed power plants in America, demonstrating how large EV batteries can stabilize the grid, provide backup power to homes, and lower overall energy costs.

“Vehicle-to-grid technology lets electric vehicles do more than just drive—they can actually help power our homes and communities,” confirmed Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at BGE. “By sharing stored energy with the grid when it is needed most, these vehicles make our energy system more reliable, more efficient, and even help lower electricity costs for customers.”

“When we enacted the DRIVE Act in 2024, it was exactly this type of innovation and collaboration that we hoped to unlock,” added Maryland State Delegate David Fraser-Hidalgo. “I am excited to see this milestone reached, as we hope to see these types of customer-centered solutions scale up to meet our state’s electricity needs.”

Overcoming Technological Hurdles

EVs have long been acknowledged as a potential ‘new’ power source for electric utilities. Researchers in the late 1990s theorized that compensation for dispatching to the grid would help offset ownership costs, and the EV’s battery life would not be noticeably impacted by such use. If only 25% of the United States adopted electric vehicles with bidirectional chargers, they found, grid operators would have access to a staggering 660 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.

It’s no surprise, then, that the vehicle-to-grid space has attracted attention from companies outside of Sunrun and Ford, including microinverter monolith Enphase, which has products participating in dozens of virtual power plants across the country.

“The battery in your car is 10 times the size of a normal stationary battery that you put on the side of the home. The value of that as a flexible asset to the grid is huge,” Andy Newbold, Enphase’s senior director of corporate communications, told Factor This.

Enphase recently unveiled its new IQ Bidirectional EV Charger architecture, featuring V2H and V2G capabilities. The charger connects to the EV’s direct current (DC) port, enabling homeowners to charge their vehicle, power their home, and share energy with the grid through the Enphase app. The offering has been a long time coming, slowed by the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards.

“The automakers needed to come together and set universal standards, otherwise you’d have to build a different charger for every car,” Enphase’s Newbold explained. “That happened over the past year. We’re not fully there yet, but it’s close. That’s why we [now] actually have demonstrated a product.”

“I think vehicle to home is a no-brainer. Makes a lot of sense, and it’s not something that would be happening every day,” he added. “When it comes to vehicle-to-grid, there are still things to figure out: the automaker standards, the utility standards, how these resources are allowed [to be used] on the grid, stuff like that.”

Newbold expects to see much of the mess sorted out over the next six to eight months.

“And then I think a lot of really compelling products will hit the market, and homeowners are gonna have their minds blown, to be honest.”

Customer Adoption

With most technological roadblocks cleared, customer adoption remains the most formidable hurdle to a future powered by car batteries. Participation in a program like the one between BGE, Sunrun, and Ford, for example, asks an awful lot of the consumer: likely upgrading one’s home service to accommodate charging an EV, acquiring the vehicle and a bidirectional charger, downloading apps and enrolling, then actually following through with participation.

“You’ve got to meet them where they’re at,” recommended Ben Brown, chief executive officer of VPP and energy management platform Renew Home. “That means having a cool home and having your EV charged when it needs to be charged. These things are like non-negotiables.”

Brown envisions a future of what he calls ‘comfortable demand response,’ in which the needs of participating customers are met without worry.

“It’s really around delivering in the moments that matter most,” he continued. “Being able to make sure that when someone needs their EV charged by 9 am that it is absolutely charged by 9 am. It’s making sure that if there’s a moment in time we’re anticipating that [temperatures] might be getting uncomfortable, that you’re anticipating that before it actually happens.”

Bill Crider, the senior director of Ford’s global charging and energy services arm, suggests a customer’s wallet might be the quickest way to their hearts. Considering BGE is in PJM territory, home to some of the most headline-catching electricity price spikes in recent memory, he’s likely onto something.

“Educating customers that their electric vehicles have the potential to save—and even earn—them money all while parked at home is a game-changer,” Crider said. “Enabling customers to not only power their homes, but send power directly back to the grid in times of need, helps customers with financial incentives, utilities with more power capacity, and society through more grid reliability and sustainable energy practices. It’s a win-win for everyone.”

When will you benefit from all the winning? If you live outside BGE’s service area, it might be a minute, but pilots are popping up all over the place, and some are tapping into even bigger batteries.

Hirono: “If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urging him to reconsider the Trump Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA), which supports critical research that helps our country in facilitating conservation management, as well as understanding and responding to environmental threats. The USGS EMA funds research facilities that employ and serve communities in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific, including Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and American Samoa.

“By zeroing out funding for the EMA, the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal poses a direct threat to that critical science and the communities that depend on it,” wrote Senator Hirono. “In Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region, the USGS EMA funds a significant amount of research that advances our understanding of the natural environment, directly benefits our communities, and supports the next generation of scientists.”

In her letter, the Senator stressed the importance of Secretary Burgum’s support for the EMA facilities, citing uncertainty and chaos surrounding government funding that has ensued since Trump took office in January.

“We cannot rely on Congress alone to fix this problem,” continued Senator Hirono. “Even if Congress disagrees with the ‘savings’ that defunding EMA provides and appropriates funding, there is no guarantee that this Administration will follow the rule of law. Currently, this Administration is freezing funding for a variety of programs and agreements across the executive branch to align with the President’s priorities, sometimes providing funding that needs to be dispersed within weeks, and other times completely clawing back the funding that Congress has appropriated.”

Senator Hirono also listed examples of facilities in Hawaii and across the Pacific region that would be impacted by a reduction in EMA funding, including the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center (PI-CASC) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; the Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center (PIERC); and the Hawaii Cooperative Fishery Research Unit (HCFRU). The President’s budget would also eliminate eight other regional CASCs across the country, as well as the national CASC.

“These are just a few examples of how devastating these decisions are for Hawaii and the Pacific Region, but these impacts will play out in communities across the country,” concluded the Senator. “If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats.”

The full text of the letter is available here and below.

Dear Secretary Burgum:

I write to express my deep concerns about this Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA). This short-sighted decision will have a lasting negative impact on Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region. I urge you, as the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, to change course and fully support this mission area.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the EMA “provides science that directly benefits the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people by providing trusted and timely information to help address the Nation’s toughest management and conservation issues impacting public lands and the surrounding communities that benefit from them.” By zeroing out funding for the EMA, the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal poses a direct threat to that critical science and the communities that depend on it.

In Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region, the USGS EMA funds a significant amount of research that advances our understanding of the natural environment, directly benefits our communities, and supports the next generation of scientists. For example, the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center, or PI-CASC, is hosted at the University of Hawaii Manoa and is comprised of 13 federal and university staff and research fellows and, supports over 25 student researchers each year. This center, which serves Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and American Samoa, not only provides critical information to natural and cultural resource managers and decisionmakers on climate impacts but also supports students who will go on to become our country’s next generation of scientists. The President’s budget does away with the PI-CASC, eight other regional CASCs located throughout the country, and the national CASC. Further, for the first time since the CASCs were established in 2010, your department has failed to renew in a timely manner contracts with three of the regional centers that expire in 2025—the Northeast CASC, the South Central CASC, and PI-CASC.

Defunding USGS EMA will also result in the shuttering of the Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center, or PIERC. This center employs 26 people and 21 federally funded research staff and performs critical work to protect biological resources in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Islands. This work includes researching the brown tree snake to ensure it does not spread from Guam to other islands while also managing brown tree snake populations within Guam. PIERC staff are also working to save the remaining populations of Hawaiian native forest birds, which are critically important to native ecosystems and Hawaiian culture, as they face extinction. PIERC also serves as a lead organization in the fight to arrest addressing Rapid Ohia Death, which has killed millions of native Ohia trees throughout Hawaii. Finally, PIERC is aiding in the effort to restore ecosystems following increasingly frequent wildfire events throughout the Hawaiian Islands.

Other important USGS work in Hawaii that will abruptly end should EMA be eliminated includes the Hawaii Cooperative Fishery Research Unit (HCFRU), which supports 2 federal employees and 10-22 students each year to support the priorities of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). Specifically, HCFRU teaches and trains students and DLNR staff on monitoring non-commercial fisheries, managing fisheries, and protecting public health from fish poisoning. At a time when interest in increasing domestic food supply in Hawaii is so high, ending this federal support is inappropriate. Additionally, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Field Station in Honolulu, which is made up of 3 staff, specifically works with the Department of Defense and the State of Hawaii to control movement of marine and terrestrial invasive species in Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. Given the geopolitical significance of the region and the susceptibility of island ecosystems to invasive species, this loss of decades of expertise and experience would be detrimental to natural resource managers. It would also be a waste of $2 million, which was allocated in 2024 to complete state-of-the-art laboratory facilities to serve wildlife health needs for Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.

We cannot rely on Congress alone to fix this problem. Even if Congress disagrees with the “savings” that defunding EMA provides and appropriates funding, there is no guarantee that this Administration will follow the rule of law. Currently, this Administration is freezing funding for a variety of programs and agreements across the executive branch to align with the President’s priorities, sometimes providing funding that needs to be dispersed within weeks, and other times completely clawing back the funding that Congress has appropriated. There are reports that FY2025 Congressionally appropriated funds for USGS EMA programs will be rescinded. Furthermore, for the CASCs specifically, even if federal funding is provided by Congress and your department makes the funds available, the three regional centers with expired contracts will not be able to continue operations without signing new agreements. Your support for EMA and within this DOI mission areas like PIERC, PI-CASC, and the CFRUs is needed now.

These are just a few examples of how devastating these decisions are for Hawaii and the Pacific Region, but these impacts will play out in communities across the country. The President’s FY26 budget claims that the important research funded by the USGS EMA is best supported by states. With no plan in place for how states will successfully continue the work, one can assume gaps will form, setting our country back by years, if not decades, and making us vulnerable to competing foreign entities in the region. In the short term, resource managers will have less information on which to base decisions. Long-term, our pipeline of next generation scientists will be weakened reducing the United States’ standing as a global leader and eroding our nation’s influence.

If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats. I urge you to reverse these ill-conceived cuts and restore full funding and support for the EMA.

Sincerely,

Dive Brief:

A first-of-its-kind hydrogen- and battery-powered microgrid project is up and running in the remote California town of Calistoga, according to a Sept. 25 announcement by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Energy Vault.

The Calistoga Resiliency Center provides backup power to the town of 1,600 by using hydrogen fuel cells to charge lithium-ion batteries on a site that was too small to allow for wind or solar power generation, the companies said.

Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, said in an interview that interest in hydrogen fuel cells has grown over the past year or two as data centers and other large-load customers seek alternatives to diesel generators.

Dive Insight:

The community of Calistoga has yet to call on the resiliency center as backup, but tests show it can power the town for at least 48 hours, according to Jeremy Donnell, senior manager of microgrid strategy implementation at PG&E.

The company says it believes the hybrid system is the very first of its kind. The 293-MWh microgrid system replaced a diesel generator that PG&E deployed in Calistoga in 2019-2020 to provide backup generation in the event of a public safety power shutoff, Donnell said in an interview.

Developer Energy Vault came up with the hybrid battery/hydrogen fuel cell design in response to PG&E's request for a solution that could eliminate the diesel generator while occupying the same footprint and for no more than twice the cost.

The project mostly draws energy from on-site hydrogen fuel cells that are hooked up to a 130-foot liquid hydrogen storage tank, Donnell said. A third-party vendor refills the tank with hydrogen; the site lacks the space needed for hydrogen production or for wind or solar generation to charge batteries.

PG&E doesn't anticipate replacing its other diesel generators with fuel cells because the company isn't conducting as many broad-scale public safety power shutoffs as it used to, Donnell said. But the project yielded valuable information about how to connect similar projects to the company's grid, he added.

Wolak said large-load customers like data centers are exploring fuel cells as they seek reliable power solutions with greater duration than lithium-ion batteries and lower emissions than fossil fuel generators.

In addition to remote sites like Calistoga, fuel cells could also be used in urban settings where space is limited, and where nearby residents may object to diesel generator noise and emissions, he said.

Growing demand for natural gas has also, somewhat unexpectedly, driven new interest in fuel cells, Wolak said.

Many fuel cells can use natural gas in the place of hydrogen, and since the gas is not burned, it does not produce on-site emissions. Building out the nation's gas distribution systems means more sites could have access to natural gas and could use fuel cell technology without the need for relatively high-cost hydrogen fuel, he said.

Fuel cells also got a boost from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Wolak said. While the bill cut tax credits for many other sources of renewable generation, it preserved a tax credit for hydrogen storage infrastructure and renewed a fuel cell tax credit that had been set to expire.

“You will see a lot more storyboarding around the fuel cell given this combination of power demand growth everywhere, and ... an uplift from the tax credits,” he said. “Watch this space, you will see more.”

Duke Energy plans to burn coal for two to four years longer than previously estimated, which will result in millions of tons in additional greenhouse gases over the next decade when combined with other proposed changes to the utility’s fuel mix.

The utility would significantly increase battery storage—by 56 percent—but also deploy fewer renewables.

The details are laid out in more than 100 pages of the utility’s biennial Carbon Plan, released Oct. 1 and submitted to the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

Duke cited the state’s growing energy demand, driven by data centers and large manufacturers, coupled with the Trump administration’s fossil-fuel friendly energy policy as reasons for the changes. This includes the rollback of federal air regulations, increased support for the coal industry and the end of renewable power subsidies.

State policy, too, shaped the plan. Senate Bill 266, now law after the state legislature in late July overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, allowed Duke to eliminate its interim goal of a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035. Instead, the utility is only subject to a goal of net zero by 2050.

Under its previous plan, Duke projected it would shutter its remaining coal-fired power plants no later than 2035. Last year the utility retired the Allen Steam Station on Lake Wylie, where the first battery storage goes online next month.

But unfettered by the interim carbon reduction goal, several of those retirement dates have been extended to the mid-to-late 2030s, depending on the plant.

Belews Creek, in Stokes County, would burn coal as late as 2040, four years longer than planned, when Duke projects a small nuclear reactor could come online.

Belews Creek emitted 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carbon dioxide equivalent is a unit of measurement to evaluate the impact of different greenhouse gases.

Some units at the Cliffside and Marshall plants would burn coal for an extra two years, until 2033 and 2034.

These plants, and several others, can burn coal and natural gas, further increasing emissions of potent planet-warming gases, carbon dioxide and methane.

“We continue making progress on coal retirements while balancing regulatory approvals and increased load growth,” Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton said. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers prior to further coal plant retirements.”

CleanAIRE NC, a nonprofit environmental group based in Charlotte, issued a statement expressing “serious concerns about Duke Energy’s proposed plan, which continues to prioritize fossil fuel expansion, delays coal retirement, and lacks meaningful engagement with the communities most vulnerable to environmental and economic harm.”

Duke acknowledges that coal is risky. It is more expensive and considerably more polluting than natural gas. Nationwide, mining has declined, both in the number of workers and the amount of coal produced.

Even though the Trump administration is opening public lands in the western U.S. for coal mining, Duke has outfitted its plants to burn low-sulfur coal sourced from Central Appalachia, where production is waning.

Norton said Duke “continues to plan for an orderly retirement of coal as a necessary means to protect reliability in light of the increasing challenges in the operation of these end-of-life assets.”

The utility plans to continue to expand its natural gas fleet, which requires more than 100 miles of new pipeline in North Carolina. The pipelines, compressor stations and the plants themselves leak and emit tons of methane, a greenhouse gas that, while shorter-lived in the atmosphere, is 86 times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide over 20 years.

Meech Carter, clean energy campaigns director for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters Foundation, said gas infrastructure additions are “driven by the expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence, allowing big technology companies and Duke Energy to profit at ratepayers’ expense.”

The extent of data centers’ effects on energy demand remains unclear. Analysts with Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability posit that targeted, timed reductions in power demand could ease the strain on the grid without massive power-plant buildouts.

Duke has reined in its plans for solar power, compared to the previous Carbon Plan. It had originally projected to add 8,200 megawatts by 2031; the new proposal reduces the megawattage to 7,900 and extends the date to 2033.

The utility previously projected it would add 3,600 megawatts of onshore and offshore wind within the next decade. But the new energy mix eliminates wind power until at least 2040, reflecting President Donald Trump’s rejection of that energy source.

The Trump administration recently canceled $679 million for offshore wind projects. None were in North Carolina, but a nearby wind logistics port in Norfolk, Virginia, lost more than $39 million in federal funding.

Duke also plans to request permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to increase power and extend licenses for existing nuclear plants.

After a lengthy public hearing process, the state utilities commission must issue an order on the plan—approving it as is or requiring amendments—by Dec. 31, 2026.",https://cardinalpine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/shutterstock-787594231.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 15:04:51.051523

This project will create at least 101 new, full-time jobs over the next three years.

The company has entered into a 15-year lease at 33 Powell Avenue in Hazleton. Relocating into a larger facility will allow the company to increase production to meet demand while also providing enough space for the development of new, innovative products at the Hazleton facility.

“Pennsylvania is attracting companies from across the nation thanks to the work my Administration is doing to improve our business environment, build more shovel-ready sites, and invest in our communities — today’s announcement is another clear example of that,” said Governor Shapiro. “When companies want to grow, they look to our Commonwealth. With a strategic location near major markets, and a talented, skilled workforce, Pennsylvania has so much to offer and we remain committed to making strategic investments to further boost our economy and create more good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians.”

The Shapiro Administration has successfully won major deals and recruited businesses to move to Pennsylvania. Companies like Excelitas Technologies(opens in a new tab), which relocated its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh and will create at least 250 new jobs, and Adare Pharma(opens in a new tab), which is bringing 115 new jobs to its relocated headquarters in Northeast Philadelphia, are joining a growing list of businesses choosing Pennsylvania as the best place to expand and innovate.

Mint-X received a funding proposal from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) that includes a $300,000 Pennsylvania First Grant. The company also received a $1,592,686 Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) loan from DCED for the project.

“This project is boosting Luzerne County’s rich manufacturing industry, and creating over 100 new, good-paying jobs for the region,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger. “We’re thrilled Mint-X has chosen Pennsylvania to grow, and the Shapiro Administration will continue to support projects like this one that create more opportunities for Pennsylvanians and help revitalize communities.”

Mint-X, founded in 2008, manufactures and distributes the world’s only Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered and patented rodent-repellent trash bags. The company produces its branded Mint-X bags and also produces private label bags with its integrated Mint-X technology for Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Target, Costco, and Dollar General.

“We are very excited to move our operation to Northeastern Pennsylvania, and we’re grateful for the warm welcome we’ve already received from the Commonwealth,” said Jeff Dussich, CEO, Mint-X. “We spent more than a year searching for a new home for our manufacturing facility. The strong labor pool and strategic location near the intersection of I-80 and I-81 ultimately made Hazleton the perfect place for us.”

""NEPA Alliance is proud to partner with Mint-X on this strategic expansion into Luzerne County,"" said Stephen Ursich, Vice President, NEPA Alliance. ""By supporting innovative companies like Mint-X, we’re helping to bring high-quality jobs to our region and reinforcing NEPA’s role as a hub for industrial growth. We thank Governor Shapiro and DCED for their leadership in making projects like this possible.""

Large portions of the federal government remain shuttered, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been furloughed. Senators returned to Washington, D.C., on Oct. 6, 2025, as discussion around a potential extension of the advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continue to be the main sticking point. Democrats are pushing to tie ACA provisions to any CR, while Republicans insist policy talks wait until the government reopens.

The Trump Administration has continued to release wide-ranging executive orders (EOs). For the latest updates, see our ""Trump's 2025 Executive Orders: Updates and Summaries"" tracking chart.

An EO titled ""Unlocking Cures for Pediatric Cancer with Artificial Intelligence,"" issued on Sept. 30, 2025, seeks to drive innovation in the prevention and treatment of childhood diseases. The EO directs the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission – in coordination with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (ASTP) and Special Advisor for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Crypto – to develop ways to incorporate the use of advanced technologies such as AI to support the improved diagnosis, treatment, cure and prevention of childhood cancer. The EO calls for an expansion of pediatric cancer research using existing federal funding for projects that prioritize improved data infrastructure, enhanced data analysis and improved clinical trial designs through incorporation of AI.

Regulatory Updates

VA Releases M-25-21 AI Compliance Plan

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has released its M-25-21 AI Compliance plan, becoming the first agency to make its plan public under the Trump Administration's management memo M-25-21, which required agencies to outline how they will govern and deploy AI by Oct. 1, 2025. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plans have not yet been released. The VA's plan says certain use cases, including AI tools for clinical documentation and predictive analytics, will inform adoption in its new electronic health record system. While all agencies were due to submit similar strategies, no other HHS agencies' plans have been publicly released so far.

ARPA-H Announces Funding Under POSEIDON Program

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) announced on Sept. 30, 2025, that four research and development teams would receive a total of $147 million in funding awards under its Platform Optimizing SynBio for Early Intervention and Detection in Oncology (POSEIDON) program. Funding will support the development of sensitive and specific first-in-class, at-home, over-the-counter, synthetic Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests to identify more than 30 stage 1 solid tumors using only breath or urine samples.

According to the National Cancer Institute, more than two million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2025. Currently, there is not a recommended screening test for nearly 60 percent of diagnosed cancers, such as brain, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Current multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests can't accurately identify stage 1 solid tumors, which is critical to effectively diagnosing and treating cancers. Additionally, the cost of late-stage, non-curative cancer treatment is two to three times higher than early-stage, potentially curative treatment. POSEIDON has the potential to make significant, lasting healthcare and economic contributions to the future of cancer care for all Americans.

If successful, the over-the-counter, at-home MCED test device kit will be fully integrated into clinical care through electronic health record and telemedicine-capabilities. The kit aims to ensure that individuals will connect with a healthcare professional via a telemedicine call within 96 hours and will receive their results either virtually or in-person at the clinician's discretion. In cases of a positive result (e.g., presence of cancer), individuals will be connected to the nearest medical center for an official diagnostic work-up and continued care.

POSEIDON's emphasis on translation and market penetration ensures the resulting tests will be available to all Americans if they so choose. Further, POSEIDON's commercial focus is reflected in each team's structure, which requires that all teams have a clearly defined commercial entity responsible for bringing these cutting-edge technologies to the market.

CMS Projects Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans Expected to Remain Stable in 2026

CMS announced on Sept. 26, 2025, that average premiums, benefits and plan choices for Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans are projected to remain stable in 2026. CMS released its projections in advance of the upcoming Medicare Open Enrollment Period, which begins Oct. 15, 2025, and runs through Dec. 7, 2025.

The average MA plan is expected to decrease from $16.40 to $14 in 2026, including MA plans that provide prescription drug coverage and special needs plans (SNPs). CMS projects that 34 million beneficiaries will be enrolled in an MA plan in 2026, a decrease from 34.9 million beneficiaries in 2025. MA enrollment is expected to represent about 48 percent of all individuals enrolled in Medicare. The total number of MA plans available nationwide will decrease from 5,633 in 2025 to 5,600 in 2026.

The average standalone Part D plan premium is projected to decrease from $38.31 in 2025 to $34.50 in 2026. The average Part D total premium for MA plans with prescription drug coverage is projected to decrease from $13.32 in 2025 to $11.50 in 2026.

CMS Releases IPAY 2028 Final Guidance

CMS released the final Initial Price Applicability Year (IPAY) 2028 guidance for the next round of Medicare drug price negotiation on Oct. 1, 2025. The guidance details the requirements and parameters for the third cycle of Medicare drug price negotiation. CMS will select up to 15 additional drugs under Part D or Part B that are eligible for drug price negotiation. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), IPAY 2028 will include drugs or biological products payable under Part B as eligible for negotiation.

Notably, CMS chose not to finalize changes related to fixed combination drugs that it had proposed in the draft IPAY 2028 guidance. However, CMS notes its ""intent to address this program's integrity risk and that it is continuing to consider the appropriate policy to implement in rulemaking beginning initial price applicability year 2029."" In the draft guidance, CMS proposed changing its interpretation of when a combination drug would qualify as a single source drug, which may have resulted in certain drug formulations being subject to Medicare negotiation, but CMS opted against finalizing the change in the final guidance.

DEA Proposes Adjusted Manufacturer Quotas for Certain Ingredients

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published a notice in the Federal Register on Oct. 1, 2025, outlining new proposed adjusted manufacturer quotas for 2025 for d-amphetamine and methylphenidate, two ingredients that can be used in the manufacturing of medications to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current quota for d-amphetamine is 21,200,000 grams of anhydrous acid or base, and the adjusted quota is 26,450,000. The current quota for methylphenidate is 53,283,000, and the adjusted quota is 58,283,000. Each year, the DEA sets the annual production quotas (APQs) to set the quantities of certain ingredients of Schedule I and II substances that may be manufactured to meet research, clinical and industrial needs of the U.S.

FDA Expands Early Alert to Include All Medical Devices

FDA announced on Sept. 29, 2025, that it would expand the Early Alert communications for all medical devices following the completion of a successful pilot program announced on Nov. 21, 2024. The Early Alert communications seek to minimize the time between FDA being notified of potentially high-risk medical device removals or corrections and that notification being made publicly. The initial pilot focused on a limited number of device areas but has now been expanded to include all device areas. At this time, FDA has not announced further guidance on the process for Early Alerts being issued or what criteria must be met for inclusion.

President Trump, Major Pharmaceutical Company Make MFN Drug Pricing Announcement

President Donald Trump and a major pharmaceutical company announced on Sept. 30, 2025, the first agreement to provide prescription drugs to U.S. patients at a significantly reduced price. The announcement, which took place following President Trump's efforts to implement a most-favored-nations (MFN) drug pricing framework to align the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. with other developed nations, is expected to be the first of several as companies seek to meet key aims of the Trump Administration's drug pricing strategy. As part of the agreement, the company will offer prescription drugs within its portfolio at reduced prices through a direct-to-consumer platform to be called TrumpRx, with discounts as high as 85 percent off the list price. In addition, the company will price newly approved medications in the U.S. at a price point aligned with that of comparable markets around the world. The company also committed to spending an additional $70 billion to move manufacturing and production of pharmaceutical products back to the U.S. The Trump Administration, following the company's announcement, will not assess tariffs on the company's pharmaceutical imports for three years. The agreement will also ensure that state Medicaid programs may access MFN prices on products made by the manufacturer.

Separately, a trade association representing leading pharmaceutical manufacturers announced its members also plan to invest $500 billion in U.S. infrastructure over the next decade. The trade association will also create a website to highlight direct purchasing options available through individual companies.

Two Mandatory Payment Models at OMB: GLOBE and GUARD

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is currently reviewing two mandatory payment models focused on drug pricing: Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing (GLOBE) and Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD). These models would likely adjust how payments are made for prescription drugs under Medicare, with the goal of addressing costs and incentivizing value-based care. Specifics on methodology remain to be seen and it is currently unknown when additional information on the models may be released.

With the current federal government shutdown, the review process for these models has been halted. Until the shutdown ends, agencies and industry participants are essentially in a holding pattern regarding these two potential payment models. Further, the recent announcement of TrumpRx may factor into forward movement.

Federal Employee Unions Challenge Administration For Intent to Carry Out Additional Firings During the Government Shutdown

In a new lawsuit filed on Sept. 30, 2025, unions representing federal, state, county and municipal employees challenged the Trump Administration's threats to conduct additional RIFs while the federal government is shut down. The lawsuit, in part, centers upon guidance issued by the OMB in advance of the shutdown authorizing agency leaders to carry out additional firings of federal employees. The lawsuit seeks an injunction, with the unions claiming that the actions are ""contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious"" and arguing that the OMB has exceeded its statutory authority by authorizing the RIFs while the government is in a shutdown. The lawsuit also seeks to invalidate actions taken during the shutdown.

New Medication Abortion Case Filed

Legal efforts to limit access to medication abortion continue, with a new case being transferred from Texas to a federal court in Missouri. The case is the next step in a multi-year battle over access to mifepristone following the U.S. Supreme Court's previous decision that a group of physicians and medical organizations lacked legal standing to sue because they could not show they would be directly harmed by the policy. The case demands that the federal government restore previous restrictions on mifepristone and follows HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's announcement on Sept. 25, 2025, that HHS would open a new investigation into the safety of mifepristone.

The Scoop

The Trump administration is considering cancelling an additional $12 billion in funding for clean energy projects beyond what it announced last week, according to a list of targeted projects reviewed by Semafor.

The “kill list,” as it was described to Semafor by a source who reviewed it, would amount to an escalation of the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy. It’s also a signal that the Trump administration is using the government shutdown as a pretext for accelerating its broader policy agenda, as it looks to turn the page on the Biden era during which the US embraced green energy projects as a way to combat climate change.

The list includes major carbon removal and clean hydrogen efforts that had been approved by the Department of Energy under the Biden administration, such as projects led by major oil and gas companies like Chevron and Occidental.

The projects on this list, combined with a tranche of cancelled funding announced last week and an earlier group of cancelled projects announced in May, bring the total of DOE funding targeted for cuts to nearly $24 billion. However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the shutdown.

As the government shutdown drags on, the US Office of Management and Budget has also threatened to withhold back pay for furloughed federal workers. An OMB spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

Know More

The new list of potential cancellations follows a pattern of cuts announced last week that especially took aim at the carbon removal industry. They risk undermining a nascent sector that, aside from its climate benefits, has drawn significant investment from the fossil fuel industry and tech companies.

“If confirmed, the elimination of the megaton carbon removal projects will be a massive setback for American climate and industrial policy,” Erin Burns, executive director of the advocacy group Carbon180, told Semafor. “These projects were never just about carbon — they were about jobs, investment, and the chance to lead in a global climate economy. Cutting them leaves communities in limbo and undermines years of progress.”

Notable

Projects being cut by the Department of Energy focus on Democrat-led states, but will cost jobs and income in Republican ones, too, according to Heatmap.

The World

at a Glance

Israel marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that triggered the conflict that has reshaped the Middle East.

The country has won since major victories against regional enemies, including Iran and Hezbollah, but at a huge cost: 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, famine has taken hold in Gaza, and Israel is increasingly isolated.

Other countries’ politics have been affected, too. Zohran Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor of New York City in large part because of his support for Palestinian rights, while governments across Europe have accelerated support for a Palestinian state.

A truce may finally be close, with Israeli and Hamas leaders nearing a ceasefire at talks brokered by US President Donald Trump.

US President Donald Trump met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, with the countries at loggerheads over trade and Trump’s comments about annexing the country’s northern neighbor.

Canada is the only G7 country not to have reached a trade deal with the US this year; a North American free trade agreement protects Ottawa from some tariffs, but it is still subject to punishing steel duties, among others.

Carney promised to be tough on Trump but Canadian firms are shedding jobs and exports are down. The Canadian leader must walk a tightrope: Trump is deeply unpopular north of the border after repeatedly suggesting making Canada the “51st state.” Polls found that 60% of Canadians say they can never fully trust the US again.

The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for research that showed the impact of quantum mechanics on everyday-sized objects.

Quantum effects were known at the level of atoms, but in the 1980s John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis showed that at very low temperatures, the strange behavior — such as particles moving directly through apparently impassable barriers — could be demonstrated in objects large enough to be held in the hand.

The discovery paved the way for quantum computing and other quantum technologies, and opened the door to several multi-billion-dollar industries. One winner of yesterday’s Physiology prize is yet to be contacted, as he is off the grid, “living his best life” hiking in Idaho.

US President Donald Trump agreed to meet his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after a “very good” call, marking a thaw in relations that were at their worst in decades.

Trump slapped a 50% tariff on Brasília — despite the US having a trade surplus with Brazil — over what he called a “witch hunt” against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally convicted over a coup plot. Analysts said the call pointed at Trump breaking with Bolsonaro, who doesn’t have a clear path back to the presidency.

Lula welcomed the shift, calling on former spats to be forgotten: “Neither the American nor the Brazilian people can suffer because of our mistakes,” he told TV Mirante.

A Sudanese militia leader was found guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region 20 years ago, in a conflict that became a prelude to the country’s present-day disaster.

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman was a leader of the Janjaweed militia, which killed hundreds of thousands of members of Darfur’s non-Arab population in the early 2000s, sparking one of the world’s gravest and most enduring humanitarian crises.

After the war, many Janjaweed fighters joined the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring parties in Sudan’s current civil war. The RSF is once again besieging Darfur, putting millions of lives at risk, with the conflict sparking the first declaration of famine globally in years.

Renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s primary source of electricity in the first half of 2025, according to new data from the energy think tank Ember. Solar power led the charge, covering 83% of the increase in electricity demand.

Ember described the moment as a “crucial turning point,” whereby clean power can keep pace with rapidly growing energy needs, particularly as the world faces the huge increase in power necessary to fuel the AI boom.

However, the think tank warned that there are significant regional differences behind the numbers; new data from the International Energy Agency revised renewable energy growth in the US by 2030 down by half. It also suggested that the pace of renewables adoption in China — the current largest renewables growth market globally — could temper, the Financial Times reported.

Renewables are expected to boom elsewhere, however: Pakistan imported enough solar panels in 2024 to generate around a third of the country’s current power generation capacity, the BBC said. And in Africa, solar panel imports are up 60% in the year to June compared with the same period last year.

OpenAI inked a deal with chip designer AMD to collaborate on AI data centers, in a challenge to semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The deal, which caused AMD’s stock to soar, reflects the tech sector’s intensifying quest for computing power and ultimately banks on a “near-limitless demand for AI,” WIRED wrote: Running AMD’s processors will match the energy needs of 5 million American homes. The US has become “one big bet on AI,” as optimism over the sector props up the economy, one analyst wrote.

Driving that bet is OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has proven to be a prolific dealmaker. The company also has agreements with firms including Nvidia and Oracle — pacts that have raised fears of an AI bubble.

Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations through Arab mediators in Egypt Monday on a Gaza peace plan, raising the possibility of a potential end to the brutal war on the eve of its two-year anniversary.

Hamas said it agrees to parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including the release of all remaining Israeli hostages, but has not acknowledged other demands, including full disarmament and its permanent exclusion from governing the enclave.

Though US President Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt its attacks, it continued to pound Gaza Monday. Trump has also threatened “complete obliteration” of Hamas if it insists on staying in power.

Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks to take credit for the emerging deal, it has become clear that Trump was “the one calling the shots,” The New York Times wrote. On Sunday night, the president exhorted negotiators to “MOVE FAST,” adding that he expected the first phase of the deal to unfold this week.

A US judge blocked the government from deploying troops to Oregon state, spotlighting the growing role of the courts in the country’s politics.

The latest order, issued late on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration looks to deploy military forces to Democrat-led cities nationwide: The White House says they are necessary to combat alleged lawlessness; Democrats argue their constituents are being targeted.

The latest decision came on the eve of the Supreme Court beginning a new term that analysts say will include significant new tests of presidential power, including over the administration’s use of tariffs, attempted curbs on birthright citizenship, and efforts to fire officials from independent government agencies.

France’s prime minister resigned less than a month after taking office, plunging the country deeper into a seemingly intractable political crisis.

Sébastien Lecornu — President Emmanuel Macron’s seventh premier — quit following widespread criticism over his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from that of the prior government.

His departure showcases the short-term challenge facing Macron’s ministers, who have repeatedly failed to pass a budget in the face of far-right and far-left opposition, and the longer-term fear over the rise of the country’s main nationalist, anti-immigration party, which is topping opinion polls.

The impasse has left investors wary: A recent Deutsche Bank survey pegged France as the country most likely to face a government bond crisis.

Japanese stocks surged after the country’s ruling party chose its next leader — and likely next prime minister — amid growing investor buoyancy over prospects for one of the world’s largest economies.

The LDP, which has ruled Japan largely uninterrupted since World War II, put Sanae Takaichi on track to be the country’s first female prime minister.

She inherits a dizzying array of challenges, including a fast-aging population and worries over Chinese aggression. Yet economists note the country has removed major barriers to business, manufacturers are feeling more upbeat, and monetary policy is normalizing: The Nikkei 225 index hit a record following Takaichi’s selection. “We are bullish on Japan,” Apollo’s chief economist wrote.

China and India agreed to restart direct flights after a five-year hiatus, the latest sign of thawing relations between the world’s most populous nations. New Delhi said flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou would restart this month for the first time since border clashes in 2020.

The decision comes just months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first visit to Beijing in seven years, with the countries’ leaders drawing closer, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, upending what had been a burgeoning bilateral partnership. Those levies were “one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got,” an expert said, forcing New Delhi to seek new allies.

Discoveries about how our immune systems avoid attacking our own bodies — research which helped create new pathways for treating autoimmune diseases — won the 2025 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

T-cells are designed to attack proteins in pathogens, but those proteins are often similar to our body’s own proteins. Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that the immune system has “self-tolerance” safeguards which prevent it from attacking our own cells.

Crucially, the findings also helped create new cancer treatments: Cancer cells use the body’s self-tolerance to hide, and immunotherapy is designed to take the brakes off and allow the immune system to attack those cells.

Japan is on track to have its first female prime minister.

A former economic security minister who cites Margaret Thatcher as her hero, Sanae Takaichi was elected to lead Japan’s governing LDP, which has ruled the country almost continuously since World War II but is mired in an array of crises.

Among her top priorities is tackling inflation — a relatively new problem given Japan’s decades of falling prices — making her selection a worrying one for investors: Takaichi will likely push for aggressive spending and looser monetary policy in a bid to boost the economy.

She will also pull Japan’s politics further to the right, mirroring a trend of resurgent populist conservatism worldwide, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

The world’s major oil producers agreed to raise output again, a move that raised fears of a supply glut and could further dampen prices.

OPEC+ is looking to reclaim market share lost to US shale producers and maintain discipline within the group — some members stand accused of violating quotas — while the group’s heavyweight member, Saudi Arabia, is likely hoping that lower prices will please US President Donald Trump.

Still, the increase was a relatively small one, a careful step taken “after witnessing how nervous the market had become,” one analyst said.

“The real test will come when fundamentals and politics shift again.” High geopolitical volatility makes predicting the market’s future even more difficult than usual, a Reuters columnist argued.

US President Donald Trump is considering a bailout of at least $10 billion to help the country’s soybean farmers survive a boycott from China.

The humble soybean has become a flashpoint in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies after Beijing ceased all purchases from the US.

The possible aid from Washington reflects China’s leverage in talks with the US, similar to how Beijing used rare-earth export curbs to extract trade concessions from Washington, analysts said.

China is now reportedly pushing for the White House to roll back national-security restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.

Birds of different species can understand each other’s alarm calls warning of cuckoos.

Brood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, tricking the hosts into caring for their offspring at the expense of their own.

Research found that 21 bird species across four continents all make similar “whining” vocalizations when they spot a brood parasite, and when played recordings of other species’ calls, they all recognize them and react by mobbing the invader.

One researcher told New Scientist that the calls, referring to external objects in the world rather than internal states such as fear or excitement, “could be the first stepping stone towards language” and that animal communication and human language were on a spectrum.

A controversial musical depicting the Spanish conquest of Mexico has ignited a transatlantic debate over Latin American history and identity.

Centering on conquistador Hernán Cortés and his Nahuatl translator, Malinche ostensibly celebrates mestizaje, or racial mixing, but has been accused of promoting “outdated, racist notions” regarding Aztec rituals, and the idea that colonization benefited indigenous people.

Foreign Policy called the show, currently playing in Mexico City, an “obscenely romanticized” “anti-Hamilton,” while conservatives complained that a historical priest was initially portrayed in drag.

Malinche’s producer, for his part, hoped the debate would “bring people to come and judge” for themselves.

The brouhaha points to real wounds: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined to invite Spain’s king to her inauguration after he failed to apologize for the conquest.

The US military struck another alleged narcotics vessel off the coast of Venezuela Friday, killing four, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.

The strike — at least the fourth such attack — brings the total number of alleged smugglers killed by the US in recent weeks to at least 18.

Hegseth wrote on X that he directed the lethal strike, carried out in international waters, on a “vessel transporting substantial amounts of narcotics — headed to America to poison our people.”

It came after the White House informed Congress this week that the country was engaged in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which the administration has designated as terrorist organizations, The New York Times reported.

The strikes have raised tensions with Caracas, which fears a full-scale invasion, as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs strikes inside the country.

Critics have questioned the legality of the campaign, with one commentator accusing Trump of emulating “the worst excesses” of US policy in Latin America.

Hamas said it agreed to release all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza under a framework proposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that it “affirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations” to discuss the details.

Earlier on Friday, Trump set a new weekend deadline for Hamas to agree to a peace deal on the enclave’s future, calling it the militant group’s “last chance.” Hamas’ statement suggested the group is seeking changes to the proposal, however, and that a deal has not yet been agreed to.

If no deal is reached by 6:00 pm Sunday Eastern time, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote in a social media post earlier on Friday.

The Trump administration’s 20-point plan, backed by Israel, demands an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the disarmament of Hamas — a condition the group has previously rejected. Hamas said on Wednesday that it was reviewing the proposal.

The plan also provides for a transitional authority run by an international group chaired by Trump, with members including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Venezuela said it had detected five US fighter jets flying near its Caribbean coast, which Caracas said amounted to “provocation,” in the latest clash between the countries.

Tensions have been rising between the US and Venezuela for months, and Washington recently struck alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Fears are growing among Venezuela’s leadership that the true goal of the US deployment is toppling the autocratic regime of President Nicolás Maduro, though some warn a military intervention could further destabilize the country. “Anyone who cares about democracy and human rights wants the Maduro dictatorship to end,” an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations said, but this strategy is “very unlikely” to make that happen.

Japan will on Saturday elect its new leader, with a millennial minister poised to become prime minister of the rapidly aging nation.

Shinjiro Koizumi, who at 44 would become Japan’s youngest leader in a century, is competing with four other candidates to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party — which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years — after the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba following two major election losses. Agriculture minister Koizumi, who bills himself a consensus builder, faces his toughest challenge in Sanae Takaichi, a conservative hardliner who would become the country’s first female ruler if she wins. But experts fear neither candidate offers Japan a clear vision to solve an array of challenges at home and abroad.

Munich airport shut down overnight after a series of drone sightings, the latest disruption to European airspace after similar events in Oslo and Copenhagen.

Thousands of passengers on dozens of flights were affected, with some having to sleep in the airport. The sightings follow a series of Russian incursions into NATO airspace, but Moscow denied responsibility for the Munich drones. Still, European leaders suggested the Kremlin was behind earlier drone sightings, and called for strengthened defenses.

Russia appears to be stepping up its hybrid warfare: British officials said Moscow-backed cyberattacks and sabotage were on the rise, and the Kremlin regularly targets UK satellites. A former British intelligence chief said this week that Britain may be “already at war with Russia.”

A woman was named Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in the role’s 1,400-year history.

Sarah Mullally will become the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church in January, a year after her predecessor resigned in a safeguarding scandal.

The first archbishop was appointed in 597 AD, but the role took on extra significance when Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534.

While Anglicanism is on the decline in Britain, it is growing worldwide — nearly 60% of adherents are in Africa, where followers are much more religiously conservative than in Britain.

The communion, already tested by divisions over attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, will be strained further by Mullally’s appointment: Many African Anglican churches refuse to ordain female priests.

South Africa secured investments from China and India to boost its car manufacturing in a bid to salvage one of the industries hardest hit by Washington’s steep tariffs.

US President Donald Trump imposed 30% levies on South African goods over what he claims are laws that discriminate against white South Africans. The rates have pummeled the auto sector, with US-bound exports dropping 90% in the second quarter compared to the previous year. Pretoria warned the sweeping tariffs could cost Africa’s most industrialized economy as many as 100,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, analysts warn that Washington’s levies, as well as the expiry of a sub-Saharan Africa-US free trade deal, will push African nations even closer to Beijing’s sphere of influence.

Taylor Swift released her 12th original album, The Life of a Showgirl, which is expected to break new records to further cement the pop queen’s dominance.

Swift has been “pop’s alpha figure for more than a decade,” The New York Times noted, and in the 18 months since her last release, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has reached new heights of success — and fame. Her Eras Tour was the most lucrative in history, she bought back ownership of her early albums’ master recordings, and she got engaged.

Anticipation for Showgirl has been “off the charts,” Forbes reported, with more than 5 million pre-saves on Spotify — the most ever — and it is “almost a foregone conclusion” that Swift will become the first female artist to break 100 million career album sales.

Two people have died and three others are in a serious condition after a car ramming and knife attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, UK, on Thursday. The suspect is also believed to have been killed after being shot by police, the BBC reported.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer returned early from a meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen to chair the government’s emergency response group, saying that he was “appalled” by the incident. Security is being stepped up at Jewish sites across the country.

The attack, which took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, comes amid a sharp rise in anti-Semitic assaults in the US and Europe as the Israel-Hamas war nears the two-year mark.

France and Germany have seen a surge in incidents, while two staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot dead in May, and an attack injured 12 in Colorado weeks later.

Israeli naval ships intercepted a flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza and detained several activists, including Greta Thunberg.

The “Global Sumud Flotilla” of more than 40 vessels set sail in September, intending to breach Israel’s naval blockade of the enclave, where the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is underway. Israel said several vessels were taken to port, citing what it called a violation of a “lawful naval blockade,” but flotilla organizers said their boats had been illegally boarded and targeted with water cannon and drones.

The boats have become an international cause célèbre: They were escorted part-way by Italian and Spanish naval ships, and their interception has been met by protests in several European countries.

At least two people died and dozens were arrested in Morocco, the latest site of Gen Z protests that have rocked countries worldwide.

Though the North African country has for years avoided mass demonstrations owing to the government’s ironfisted rule, protests have erupted in recent days over what demonstrators say is misplaced spending.

Rabat has prioritized readying the country to host matches for the 2030 Men’s soccer World Cup at the expense of greater investment in social services, demonstrators say. “The right to health, education and a dignified life is not an empty slogan,” the protest’s organizers said.

The demonstrations mirror recent Gen Z-led protests in Nepal and Madagascar that have forced rulers to resign.

European leaders backed a plan to build a so-called drone wall to bolster the continent’s defenses, aiming to send a clear message to Moscow after multiple Russian incursions into NATO airspace. The continent is scrambling to build the necessary capacities to defend against drones, highlighting not only its lagging technology but also how rapidly warfare has shifted to the use of unmanned aircraft. According to NATO, the Russian army is now capable of making drones for a few thousand dollars that Europe can only shoot down with missiles that cost millions of dollars apiece. Moscow’s ongoing hybrid war makes a drone wall necessary, Finland’s prime minister argued: “Russia will continue and we have to be ready.”

US President Donald Trump signed a NATO-like security guarantee for Qatar, part of efforts to reassure the emirate after an Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Doha last month.

The executive order pledges to take all measures, including US military support, to defend the Gulf state, though its legal and practical value is in question. Such agreements have historically required the approval of the US Senate, and the announcement was met with criticism from some of Trump’s conservative supporters.

The move was ostensibly made to reassure Washington’s Gulf allies following the Israeli strike — Saudi Arabia has already reached a mutual-defense pact with nuclear-armed Pakistan — but Politico nevertheless called it a “shocking departure from the administration’s America First approach.”","https://img.semafor.com/c6d61dd4ac81560309cef3da87e183fabb71b979-5582x4000.jpg?rect=0,535,5582,2931&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-07 15:03:37.375632

1. Global solar and wind generation overtake coal for the first time

Solar and wind outpaced the growth of global electricity demand in the first half of 2025, vaulting renewables toward overtaking coal worldwide for the first time on record, according to analysis published Tuesday by the research outfit Ember. This year’s growth resulted in a small overall decline in both coal and gas-fired power generation, with India and China seeing the most notable reductions, despite the United States and Europe ratcheting up fossil fuel usage. “We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember, said in a statement. “Solar and wind are now growing fast enough to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity. This marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth.”

Wind and solar installations matched 109% of new global demand for power in the first half of 2025.Ember

That growth is projected to continue. Later on Tuesday morning, the International Energy Agency released its own report forecasting that renewable capacity will double over the next five years. Solar is predicted to make up 80% of that growth. But, factoring in the Trump administration’s policies, the forecast roughly cut in half previous projections for U.S. growth. Domestic opposition to renewables runs beyond the White House, too. Exclusive data gathered by Heatmap Pro and published in July showed that a fifth of U.S. counties now restrict development of renewables.

2. Trump orders controversial Alaska mining road to move forward

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing federal agencies to push forward with a controversial 211-mile mining road in Alaska designed to facilitate production of copper, zinc, gallium, and other critical minerals. The project, which the Biden administration halted last year over concerns for permafrost in the fast-warming region, has been at the center of a decadeslong legal battle. As part of the deal, the U.S. government will invest $35.6 million in Alaska’s Ambler Mining District, including taking a 10% stake in the main developer, Trilogy Metals, that includes warrants to buy an additional 7.5% of the company. The road itself will be jointly owned by the state, the federal government, and Alaska Native villages. “It’s a very, very big deal from the standpoint of minerals and energy,” Trump said in the Oval Office.

It’s just the latest stake the Trump administration has taken in a mineral company. In July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder of MP Materials, the company producing rare earths in the U.S. at its Mountain Pass mine in California. The move, The Economist noted at the time, marked the biggest American experiment in direct government ownership since the nationalization of the railroads in World War I. Last week, the Department of Energy renegotiated a loan to Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project in Nevada to take a stake in what’s set to become the largest lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere when it comes online in the next few years. The White House’s mineral shopping spree isn’t over. On Friday, Reuters reported that the administration is considering buying shares in Critical Metals, the company looking to develop rare earths production in Greenland. In response to the news, shares in the Nasdaq-traded miner surged 62% on Monday. Partial nationalization isn’t the only approach the administration is taking to challenging China’s grip over global mineral supplies. Last month, as I reported for Heatmap, the Defense Logistics Agency awarded money to Xerion, an Ohio startup devising a novel way to process cobalt and gallium.

3. Tesla set to roll out a cheaper Model Y — plus a surprise

Tesla looks poised to unveil a cheaper, stripped-down version of its Model Y as early as today. In one of two short videos posted to CEO Elon Musk’s X social media site, the electric automaker showed the midsize SUV’s signature lights beaming through the dark. The design matches what InsideEVs noted were likely images of the prototype spotted on a test drive in Texas. The second teaser video showed what appears to be a fast-spinning, Tesla-branded fan. “Your guess is as good as ours as to what will be revealed,” InsideEVs’ Andrei Nedelea wrote Monday. “Our money is on the Roadster or a new vacuum cleaner design to take on Dyson.”

The new products come amid an historic slump for Tesla. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin reported, the company’s share of the U.S. electric vehicle sales sank to their lowest-ever level in August despite the surge in purchases as Americans rushed to use the federal tax credits before they expired thanks to Trump’s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill Act law. Yet Musk has managed to steer the automaker’s financial fate through an attention-grabbing maneuver. Last month, the world’s richest man bought $1 billion in Tesla shares in a show of self confidence that managed to rebound the company’s stock price. But Andrew Moseman argued in Heatmap that “the bullish stock market performance is divorced not only from the reality of the company’s electric car sales, but also from, well, everything else that’s happened lately.”

4. Heavy duty trucks come in for tariffs

On Monday, Trump warned that medium and heavy-duty trucks imported to the U.S. will face a 25% tariff starting on November 1. The president announced the trade levies in a post on Truth Social on the eve of a White House visit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country would feel the pinch of tariffs on imported trucks. As the Financial Times noted, Trump had threatened to impose 25% tariffs on some trucks in late September but “failed to implement them, raising questions about his commitment to the policy.”

5. Fusion faces serious supply chain challenges

Fusion startups make a lot of bold claims about how soon a technology long dismissed as the energy source of tomorrow will be able to produce commercial electrons. Though investors are betting that, as Heatmap’s Katie Brigham wrote last year, “it is finally, possibly, almost time for fusion,” a new report from the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy shows that supply chain challenges threaten to hold back the nascent industry even if it can bring laboratory breakthroughs to market. Tritium, one of two main fusion fuels, has a half life of just 12.3 years, meaning it does not exist in significant quantities in nature. Today, tritium is primarily produced by 30 pressurized heavy water fission reactors globally, but only at a total of 4 kilograms per year. As a result, “tritium availability could throttle fusion development,” the report found. That’s not the only bottleneck. “The fusion industry will require specialized components that don’t yet have well-established supply chains, like superconducting cables and the aforementioned advanced materials, and shortages of these components would delay development and inflate costs.”

THE KICKER

Scientists mapped the RNA — the molecules that carry out DNA’s instructions — of wheat and, for the first time, identified when certain genes are active. The discovery promises to accelerate plant breeders’ efforts to develop more resilient varieties of the world’s most widely cultivated crop that use less fertilizer, resist higher temperatures, and survive with less water as the climate changes. “We discovered how groups of genes work together as regulatory networks to control gene expression,” Rachel Rusholme-Pilcher, the study’s lead author and a researcher at Britain’s Earlham Institute, said in a statement. “Our research allowed us to look at how these network connections differ between wheat varieties, revealing new sources of genetic diversity that could be critical in boosting the resilience of wheat.”

Rather than trying to build a full-scale reactor that can produce net energy via a self-sustaining fusion reaction right off the bat, Shine uses a particle accelerator to drive a series of small-scale fusion reactions. When high-energy ions connect with fuels, such as tritium or deuterium, they undergo a fusion reaction that produces high-energy neutrons and specialized isotopes more often generated for use in industry via fission.

Piefer, who has a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, started up his company by making neutrons for materials testing in the aerospace and defense industries. Unlike other forms of radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons can penetrate dense materials such as metals, hydrogen-containing fuels, or ceramics, making it possible to spot hidden flaws. An otherwise invisible crack in a turbine blade, for example, could still block or scatter neutrons, while contamination from water or oil would absorb neutrons — making these faults clear in a radiographic image.

Scientists also use neutrons to test nuclear fission fuel by identifying contamination and verifying uranium enrichment levels. According to Piefer, Shine produces the neutrons used to test half of all fission fuel today. “Fusion actually already enables the production of 50% of the fission fuel in this country,” he told me.

My mind was blown. I didn’t understand how fusion — a famously expensive endeavor — could be an economically viable option for these applications.

Piefer understood. “I’ll sit here in one breath and I’ll tell you fusion is way too expensive to compete making electricity, and in another breath that it’s much cheaper than fission for making isotopes and doing testing,” he said. As Piefer went on to explain, if the goal isn’t net energy, you can strip the fusion reactor of a good deal of complexity — no superconducting magnets, complicated structures to produce tritium fuel, or control systems to keep the burning fusion plasma contained.

With a simplified system, Piefer told me, it’s much easier to produce a fusion reaction than a fission reaction. The latter, he explained, “operates on the razor’s edge of something called criticality” — a self-sustaining reaction that must be precisely balanced. If a fission reaction accelerates too quickly, power surges dangerously and you get a disaster like Chernobyl. If it slows, there’s simply no reaction at all. Plus, even after a fission reactor shuts down, it keeps producing heat, and thus must be actively cooled. But when it comes to fusion, there’s no danger of an out of control power surge, because, unlike fission, it’s not a chain reaction — if the input conditions change, fusion stops immediately. Furthermore, fusion produces no heat after the reaction stops.

Some of Shine’s customers include manufacturers of turbine blades and explosives such as the U.S. Army and GE Hitachi, as well as the biopharmaceutical companies Blue Earth Therapeutics and Telix Pharmaceuticals. Piefer told me that the company is now “on the verge of essentially breakeven” — no fusion pun intended — when it comes to its operating expenses. These days, it’s reinvesting much of its revenue to build out what Piefer says will be the largest isotope production facility in the world in Wisconsin. Isotopes are created when high energy neutrons strike stable elements, causing the nuclei to absorb the neutron and become radioactive. The isotope’s radioactive properties make them useful for targeting particular tissues, cells, or organs in medical imaging or focused therapies..

Shine’s in-progress facility will primarily produce molybdenum‑99, the most commonly used isotope for medical imaging. The company already operates one smaller isotope facility producing lutetium-177, which features in cutting-edge cancer therapies.

Compared to materials testing, producing medical isotopes has required Shine to increase the temperature and thus the efficiency of its fusion target. Subsequent applications will require greater efficiency still. The idea is that as Shine applies its tech to increasingly challenging and energy-intensive tasks, it will also move step by step toward a commercially viable, net-energy-generating fusion reactor. Piefer just doesn’t know what exactly those incremental improvements will look like.

The company hasn’t committed to any specific reactor design for its fusion energy device yet, and Piefer told me that at this stage, he doesn’t think it’s necessary to pick winners. “We don’t have to, and don’t want to,” he said. “We’ve got this flexible manufacturing platform that’s doing all the things you need to do to get really good at making fusion systems, regardless of technology.”

Fusion energy aside, the company doesn’t even know how it’s going to reach the heat and efficiency requirements needed to achieve its next target — recycling spent fission fuel. But Piefer told me that if Shine can get there, scientists do already understand the chemistry. First, Shine would separate out the long-lived, highly radioactive waste products from the spent fuel using much the same approach it uses for isolating medical isotopes, no fusion reaction needed. Then, Piefer told me, “fusion can turn those long-lived wastes into short-lived waste” by using high-energy fusion neutrons to alter the radioactive nuclei in ways that make them decay faster.

If the company pulls that off — a big if indeed — it would then move on to building an energy-generating reactor. Overall, Piefer guesses this final stage will wind up taking the fusion industry “more time and money than most people predict.” Perhaps, he said, investors will prove willing to bankroll buzzy fusion startups far longer than their ambitious timelines currently imply. But perhaps not. And in the meantime, he thinks many companies will end up turning to the very markets that Shine has been exploring for decades now.

“So we’re well positioned to work with them, well positioned to help create mutual success, or well positioned to use our position to move ourselves forward,” Piefer told me, hinting that the company would be interested in making acquisitions.

Indeed, some fusion companies are already following Shine’s lead, eyeing isotopes as an early — or primary — revenue generating opportunity. Microreactor company Avalanche Energy eventually wants to replace diesel generators, but in the meantime plans to produce radioisotopes for medical and energy applications. U.K.-based fusion company Astral Systems is also making desktop-sized reactors, but with the central aim of selling medical isotopes.

If too many companies break their promises or extend their timelines interminably, as Piefer thinks is likely, more and more will come around to the pragmatism of Shine’s approach, he said. “Near term applications are increasingly talked about,” Piefer told me. “They’re not the highlight of the show yet, but I’d say the voice is getting louder.”

So while he still doesn’t have any idea what the final form for Shine’s hypothetical fusion power plant will take, in his mind the company is leading the race. “I believe we’re actually on the fastest path to fusion commercialization for energy of anybody out there,” Piefer told me. “Because commercial is important to us, and it always has been.”

“It was definitely touch and go whether this was all going to come together,” Victoria Rome, the director of California government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “It was a lot of complicated policy to put forward in a relatively short time frame.”

The package reauthorizes California’s signature cap and trade program, rebranded as “cap and invest,” with a slight tweak that will help lower electricity bills. It clears a major hurdle to creating a more integrated Western electricity market that has the potential to deliver cleaner energy throughout the region at lower cost. It replenishes a rapidly diminishing wildfire fund that ensures utilities don’t go belly-up when they’re found liable for wildfires — and offsets the cost to customers by limiting how much of the cost of transmission upgrades utilities are allowed to pass on. And lastly — and most controversially — in an attempt to stabilize gasoline prices, it streamlines approval of new oil wells in Kern County, California.

Not everyone was happy with the compromise. The Center for Biological Diversity condemned the oil and gas bill, while environmental justice advocates were angry that lawmakers did not do more to protect low-income communities in the reform of cap and trade. It also remains to be seen how much the cost containment measures will help. Some of them, like the new Western electricity market, likely won’t pay off for many years. The cap and trade extension could ultimately exacerbate costs.

A few other groundbreaking climate-related bills are still sitting on Newsom’s desk, such as one that would set a safe maximum indoor temperature, requiring landlords to provide cooling to tenants, and another that would override local zoning rules to allow taller, denser housing to be built near public transit. He has until next Monday to sign them. But even without those, the package illustrates how California Democrats are at least trying to leverage the new politics of affordability to advance their climate goals, and the ways in which the two are difficult to align.

Here’s a breakdown of the major changes.

Cap and trade invest through 2045

California’s cap and trade program is the state’s centerpiece climate policy. It puts a price on pollution by requiring dirty industries to buy and retire state-auctioned “allowances” for every ton of carbon they emit, with a declining amount of allowances released into the market each year. Funds raised through allowance sales are funneled into utility bill credits for consumers as well as climate-friendly projects throughout the state.

Prior to last month’s legislation, the program was only authorized to continue through 2030, and the closer that date got, the greater the uncertainty became about whether it would continue. According to one analysis, that uncertainty cost the state $3.6 billion in revenues over the year ending in May 2025 as companies relied on allowances they’d stocked up on in previous years, when they were cheaper and more plentiful. If the program was going to expire in 2030, there was less incentive to collect more — or to invest in emission-reducing solutions like replacing their boilers with industrial heat pumps.

The legislature extended cap and trade through 2045, rebranding as “cap and invest” — a more politically resonant title originating in Washington State that highlights the revenue-raising aspect of the program. It also introduced several key reforms. By 2031, earnings from the program reserved for utility credits will go exclusively toward electric bill savings, i.e. it will no longer subsidize residential gas. “The general idea was that almost every gas customer is an electric customer,” Danny Cullenward, a California-based climate economist and lawyer, told me. “And so if you shift the same total dollars from gas and electric to just electric, you concentrate the benefits on the electric side, which supports building decarbonization, but you don’t take any dollars away from the customer.”

California has the highest electric rates in the continental U.S., and so right now, switching from using natural gas to all-electric appliances is not in everyone’s best interest. Providing more relief on the electric side will help with that — especially as the price of allowances increases in the coming years, translating into more revenue to fund bill credits. The legislation also directs electric utilities to apply the credits over the summer, when bills are highest, rather than on the twice-a-year schedule they used previously.

The other major reform has to do with the way carbon offsets are integrated into the program. Previously, companies could purchase offsets instead of allowances to account for a certain amount of their emissions, giving them a cheaper way to comply. Now, every time a company retires an offset instead of an allowance, the state will also retire an allowance. This is an implicit recognition by lawmakers that carbon offsets haven’t been effective at reducing emissions, Cullenward told me.

While he called the extension of cap and invest a “profound and important accomplishment,” Cullenward also raised major concerns about its future impacts on affordability. The program literally puts a price on carbon, after all, and that price is now set to rise, pervading much of California’s economy, from the pump to the cost of goods and services. “Outside of my hope that this will be a net benefit for electric utility ratepayers, which I think is a very good and positive thing, this is not an affordability bill,” he told me.

Lawmakers have done nothing to mitigate the program’s effect on gasoline and diesel costs, he pointed out. They also haven’t addressed the elephant in the room — a $95 price ceiling on allowances that, if they ever get there, may be politically untenable. (Right now prices are around $30.) State regulators now have a chance to revise the price ceiling, Cullenward said, ideally with an eye toward balancing ambition with consumer cost impacts. “That’s the main part of the work that is completely not yet done,” he said.

Toward the creation of a coordinated Western grid

Energy nerds throughout the West have been scheming to unite its disparate grids for years. Unlike the entire eastern half of the country, where utilities buy and sell energy across state lines in competitive markets on both a daily and realtime basis, and work together to plan transmission upgrades throughout their territories, most Western states do all of their energy trading through longer-term bilateral contracts.

After years of failed efforts to change that, lawmakers have finally given California’s grid operator their blessing to work with other states in the region on creating such a market. Proponents argue that more competition and coordination between utilities in the West will create efficiencies that save money, improve reliability, and accelerate decarbonization. For example, California, which often produces more solar energy than it can use during the day, would be able to sell more of that power to other states. When there’s a heat wave coming, it’ll have more supply to draw from.

To be clear, California was already working on all this prior to last month’s legislation. The state’s grid operator launched a realtime electricity trading market in 2014, which now has 21 utility participants throughout the West. Next year it will launch an extended day-ahead market, enabling utilities to buy power about a week in advance of when they’ll need it. That will initially have just two participants, PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric, with five others planning to join in later years.

But seven companies does not a competitive market make. To grow to its fullest potential, the day-ahead market will need many more participants. That was always going to be a tough sell so long as California was in charge, Vijay Satyal, the deputy director of regional markets at the nonprofit Western Resource Advocates, told me. CAISO, California’s grid operator, is overseen by a governor-appointed board, “which is one reason why the larger West never wanted to be part of CAISO, if the governance and decision making would be controlled by the governor of one state,” he said.

An effort is already underway between state officials, utilities, and other stakeholders, including those from California, to create an independently-governed Western Energy Market called the West-Wide Governance Pathways Initiative. The new legislation grants CAISO permission to transition governance of its realtime and day-ahead markets to the organization that comes out of that effort — as long as the group meets certain requirements around transparency and engagement with state leadership.

“Now there’s opportunity for all the utilities across the West to come together and for clean energy developers to be part of a larger market and be transparent, independent, and not controlled by one state’s policies,” Satyal told me. The other advantage of having this regional organization is that it can engage in more coordinated transmission planning — another potential cost-saving measure.

Some relief from wildfire costs

Wildfires have been a huge part of California’s electricity affordability crisis. Case in point: Since 2019, Californians have had to pay an extra fee on top of their electric bills that goes into a state Wildfire Fund to help utilities cover post-wildfire loss and damage claims — a sort of insurance mechanism to prevent utility insolvency.

This year, lawmakers were under pressure to add more money to the pot. Experts worried that without another infusion, payments related to January’s Eaton Fire in Los Angeles, which the U.S. Department of Justice alleges was caused by faulty utility equipment, would deplete much of what’s left.

The legislature extended the fee, adding $18 billion to the Wildfire Fund that will be split evenly between ratepayers and utility shareholders over the next decade. But it also passed several measures that will help offset that cost by minimizing future rate increases. First, utilities will be prohibited from earning a profit on the first $6 billion they spend on wildfire mitigation projects, such as burying power lines, starting next year. Companies will be required to finance this spending more cheaply through ratepayer-backed bonds rather than through equity, which commands a higher rate of return.

On top of that, the legislature directed the governor’s office to create a “Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator,” a program that will develop public financing options for new transmission lines, such as low-cost loans, revenue bonds, or even partial public ownership of the projects. The program will have a dedicated “Revolving Fund” that will be replenished each year with a portion of cap and invest revenue.

“It is the largest electricity affordability measure in the whole package,” Sam Uden, the co-founder and managing director for the nonprofit policy shop Net Zero California, told me — to the tune of $3 billion in savings per year once the new lines are constructed, according to an analysis his group commissioned.

More drilling

Gavin Newsom has not necessarily been a friend to the oil industry. He’s instituted distance requirements for new oil wells barring drilling near homes and schools, and given local jurisdictions more authority over drilling. But gasoline prices — ever a political issue in California — have tested his resolve. The price at the pump in California has averaged around a dollar higher than the rest of the U.S. for the past several years, and that margin has crept up closer to $1.30 this year. After two of the state’s refineries announced they would close this year and next, threatening to drive prices higher, Newsom backed a bill this session to increase oil production in Kern County.

Uden of Net Zero California justified the bill as a “short term measure.” The provisions that streamline drilling permits only apply through 2036. “We are really trying to grapple with what is a very difficult transition,” he told me. “We’ve got to phase down oil, but we can’t do it in a way that just spikes gas prices.”

It’s unclear, however, whether more drilling in Kern County will do much to address the problem — especially if the cap and invest program continues to drive up prices, as Cullenward fears. At least to date, the state’s high gasoline prices have not been caused by a lack of gasoline supply, according to University of California, Berkeley, economist Severin Borenstein. The bigger factors driving price increases are taxes and environmental fees and the special blend of gasoline required by the state’s air quality regulators.

What will drive prices up are refinery closures. Lawmakers are making a bet that increased in-state oil production will prevent further closures by giving refineries access to cheaper crude. But Borenstein notes that the state will continue to rely on crude imports, meaning the price of gasoline will still be tied to the global market. His preferred solution to keep prices in check is to remove barriers to importing more refined gasoline.

“The longer run challenge is to balance refining supply and demand, which oil production doesn’t address,” Borenstein wrote.

Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment, agreed on the urgency of opening a new import terminal. He told me he saw the Kern County bill as a way to buy time. “We’ve done the kind of stopgap measure. The increased permits will help stabilize Northern California refineries for probably a couple years,” he said. “But if we don’t use that couple of years in the right way, then we will be in big trouble.”

Wara also wasn’t too worried about the measure creating some kind of oil Renaissance. “Permits are one thing. The decision to actually drill a well is an economic decision that’s going to be driven by oil prices, which are pretty low right now. I don’t think anybody thinks that handing out more permits is going to stem the decline in that industry.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTcyMDg2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNjI2MDk5OX0.k-t2cnSZwYO8RZtSCfRund8J0kikIwEJZg5HRQKaV5A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-07 15:05:32.271239

As the Trump Administration recklessly slashes over $33 million from clean energy projects in his district and more than $608 million in critical investments across Colorado, Evans is nowhere to be found.

Evans’ silence is especially ironic considering that just last month, he:

Penned an op-ed arguing that “now, more than ever, we need to invest in… innovative energy technologies” and that “modernized grids are… part of the equation.” One of the now-cancelled grants – worth $27 million – would have helped “optimize” the grid in Evans’ rural district.

Held an energy roundtable where he “reiterated [his] commitment to increasing jobs and ensuring Weld County remained a top energy producer in the state.”

Visited with one of the companies now bracing for more than $6 million in cuts and noted how their “investment will help provide more reliable, safe, and affordable energy for #CO08.”

But now that D.C. Party Bosses have decided to gut these clean energy projects, it’s crickets from Gabe Evans.

REMINDER: After voting for the Big, Ugly Bill earlier this year, Evans admitted he was jeopardizing millions in investments and thousands of good-paying jobs in his district and begged Senate Republican leaders to “mitigate” the negative impacts of his own vote.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

Lithium-ion batteries have transformed the industry due to their high energy density, lightweight design, and long cycle life. However, as the battery industry expands, safety concerns have become a pressing issue. Incidents involving battery fires, thermal runaway, and improper transportation or disposal have highlighted the need for robust safety standards and risk mitigation strategies.

The battery industry is currently navigating a complex landscape of evolving safety regulations and standards, including those established by organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and the United Nations (UN), which apply to transportation and storage. These standards aim to address critical issues, including the prevention of overheating, proper labeling for hazardous materials, and safe recycling practices. Understanding where the industry stands today involves not only recognizing the advancements in battery technology but also acknowledging the challenges in ensuring compliance with these safety measures.

A group of more than 10 experts at the Battery Show North America provided insights during a workshop titled ""Battery Safety - A Comprehensive Risk Mitigation Plan."" These industry experts brought their unique viewpoints and expertise to the discussion, offering valuable commentary on the current state of the battery industry, emerging safety challenges, and the importance of compliance with evolving standards. A key focus of the discussion was the critical need for fire departments and first responders to understand how to effectively mitigate battery fires, particularly those involving lithium-ion batteries. Here are some of the insights from some of the panelists.

Bridging the gap between fire departments and battery technology

Caroline Rudacille, Fire Lieutenant at Baltimore County Fire Department, emphasized that battery fires are fundamentally different from traditional fires and require specialized techniques. She pointed out that battery fires are ""not a fire"" in the traditional sense; they are something entirely different that fire departments are struggling to understand and respond to effectively. Fire departments are ""behind"" the technology and rely heavily on industry expertise during incidents, stressing that collaboration between battery companies and local fire departments is essential. Firefighters encounter these incidents daily but often lack the specialized knowledge needed for a safe and effective response.

Addressing safety across the battery lifecycle

Dr. Veronika Wright, CEO and Founder of Electrification Academy, emphasizes the importance of understanding battery safety across the entire life cycle, not just after an incident occurs. She explained that battery fire incidents stem from multiple trigger categories, including thermal abuse (overheating), mechanical abuse (crashes or structural damage), and electrical abuse (overcharging).

However, she emphasized that the least understood triggers are internal defects and manufacturing defects that can develop over time. As she said, ""any fresh battery cells can go into a thermal runaway, because there could be internal defects, manufacturing defects. A battery cell, a lithium-ion battery cell, is so sensitive, in a way, it really reacts to the littlest, tiniest impurifications."" Wright noted that these defects may only manifest through aging processes, and the industry currently lacks proper tracking systems to understand when and where these incidents actually originate—whether at the cell level, system level, or within the battery management system (BMS). She advocated for better incident tracking and knowledge sharing across the battery lifecycle to learn from these events and improve safety measures.

Closing gaps in dangerous goods transportation

Elizabeth Gibbons Barber, Founder, Principal Consultant at Empower to Comply LLC identified critical gaps in the transportation of dangerous goods, emphasizing that the industry faces significant challenges as technology rapidly evolves. She said, “There are a lot of differences in how teams and organized organizations interpret what Damaged, Defective, Recalled (DDR) means because it's a qualitative determination. You have to talk with technical experts to determine your risk.""

She emphasized that compliance doesn't always equate to safety, highlighting concerns about regulatory requirements that may not adequately address real-world risks: ""It's important to audit beyond compliance and apply risk-based improvements."" She advocated for industry collaboration to address these gaps, saying, ""I encourage everyone to lean into the vulnerability, to just say, like, here are my questions, where vulnerability can be hard when you're representing your organization, and I get the liability point, but it's a good time for us to discuss with each other. Ultimately, Gibbons reminded the audience that ""incidents remind us to stay humble and keep learning. Regulations exist because of lessons paid in lives, property, and money, and every safer seat and every compliance shipment adds to that silent success story.""",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt70ddcd21313a2be2/68e42a6ea8e89107685f64d1/Battery_Safety_Workshop.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-07 16:02:12.544077

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO is lead plaintiff in the suit, filed in federal court in Providence.
The Solar for All program was projected by the Biden administration to help 900,000 households get access to solar power.
It would save Americans, the Biden administration said, $350 million a year in energy costs.
“This is like a one-two punch to the people of Rhode Island,” he said.","A major Rhode Island labor union and a coalition of homeowners, solar energy companies and nonprofits sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday, over its termination of $7 billion in grants meant to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels.

The suit concerns the Solar for All program, part of the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. The lawsuit accuses the EPA of illegally clawing-back funding without Congressional approval.

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO is lead plaintiff in the suit, filed in federal court in Providence. Patrick Crowley, the union’s president, said cancelling the program means losing hundreds of jobs in the state. Nationally, the program was projected to generate 200,000 new jobs.

“It’s going to limit the amount of work opportunities for the members that I represent to do solar installation,” Crowley said. “It’s going to lead to increased energy costs, because without solar energy as part of an ‘all of the above strategy,’ it means that Rhode Island is going to be subject to more turbulence in the electricity market, like we’ve seen over the last several winters.”

The plaintiffs are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Rhode Island Center for Justice and Lawyers for Good Government.

The Solar for All program was projected by the Biden administration to help 900,000 households get access to solar power. It would save Americans, the Biden administration said, $350 million a year in energy costs.

But EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called Solar for All “a boondoggle,” in a video on social media. Over the summer, it was one of several big renewable energy programs that saw funding clawed back by the Trump administration.

“This is just another example of the administration targeting programs that would help low-income, disadvantaged communities,” Crowley said, “but also the hurt states like Rhode Island that want to diversify our energy portfolio so that we can control costs.”

Rhode Island’s share of the $7 billion program amounted to more than $49 million.

The AFL-CIO’s Crowley said the cancellation of Solar for All will hurt that much more because of the abrupt cancellation of off-shore wind projects like Revolution Wind.

“This is like a one-two punch to the people of Rhode Island,” he said. “It’s going to hurt everyone’s pocketbook.”

The ash dust is fine as talc, and breathing it is making neighbors sick.
Oh, and let’s not forget the Frankenfish and other mutant creatures horribly disfigured by coal ash poisoning.","Looking for a scary Halloween story? Well you’ve come to the right place for a tale that will chill your bones and leave you questioning all you once thought true. While your typical ghost story always has a spooky setting (an empty stretch of highway in a rainstorm, or a cemetery at midnight…), hinting at the presence of witches, monsters or zombies, this story could be happening in your own backyard. You, your family, your neighbors are all unsuspecting of the dangers lurking nearby.

I’m talking about coal ash, the toxic menace creeping across our landscape like The Blob, gobbling up hundreds of acres and looming over communities across America. The waste is truly a mad scientist’s brew of toxic heavy metals, pollutants and other power plant waste. Dumped in giant open lagoons, most of which are unlined and located directly along our favorite waterways, slowly poisoning rivers, lakes and streams. Across the Southeast there are over 450 of these dumps, at least 21 of these are real monsters earning them a high hazard rating from EPA. Unlike good old-fashioned monsters and ghouls that leap out to grab you, this hidden danger literally seeps into people’s lives; plaguing communities with mysterious illnesses, shattering people’s dreams and leaving ghost towns in its wake.

This is truly the stuff of nightmares and it’s happening more than any of us would like to think.

Take, for example a few particularly frightening tales from across our region. There’s the horror story going on in Juliette, Georgia; a picturesque rural town that’s served as the bucolic backdrop of several movies. Community members living near the Scherer Power Station started suffering from bizarre diseases with no explanation–rare forms of cancer, kidney disease and disfiguring hives. After years of medical tests they discovered their drinking water was poisoned with uranium and other heavy metals. It’s like finding out that the killer calling you is already in your house! Worse yet, there’s no way to get away from the horror; with their property values destroyed, Juliette residents are forced to live through a never-ending ordeal, afraid of the water that comes into their homes.

The community of Cane Run, Kentucky had been haunted by coal ash for years as Louisville Electric & Gas has piled the toxic trash into a mountain that looms over the community. A grey phantom hangs over nearby homes as toxic dust blows from the piles of ash, blanketing everything in its path and sending neighbors running into their homes for safety. The ash dust is fine as talc, and breathing it is making neighbors sick. Children are especially vulnerable to doses of mercury, lead, arsenic and other poisons in the ash and can ingest these toxics when they play outside. In the words of one Cane Run resident:

“You’ve got black soot everywhere…kids that have learning disabilities. There’s excessive amounts of ADHD. There’s excessive amounts of cancer, kidney disease. People are sick there constantly. They’re dying. I’m just sick and tired of it. I’ve lived there for 35 years and all I do is watch people die.”

These are only a few of the horrifying examples of communities threatened by coal ash — if you want to get really scared check out www.SoutheastCoalAsh.org to find out if ash lurks in the places you live, work and play. This waste can strike in other blood curdling ways, too. Sometimes, as happened in 2008 in the Kingston disaster, entire neighborhoods are wiped out in a single day by a billion gallon flood of toxic sludge.

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

Additional Topics on Which EPA Seeks Comment:

Data about which refrigerants are being considered or adopted in new refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses;

Data about the commercial availability and timeline for adoption of new refrigeration equipment using lower-GWP substitutes in remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses, as it relates to the proposed 2032 compliance dates for these subsectors;

Data about costs and savings resulting from the extension of compliance timelines for manufacturers and servicing companies, which are investing in U.S. production of new raw materials, refrigerants, equipment, and other technologies, intended to support companies’ transition and compliance, across the subsectors in this rule;

The proposed removal of the installation compliance date for residential and light commercial air conditioning systems, as well as whether an extension of the installation compliance date by one or more years would be appropriate, noting that EPA does not have information about the extent of equipment that may remain in inventory as of January 1, 2026, and account for any significant reliance interests in the final action as well as any significant reliance interests that should be accounted for in any final action; and

It currently assembles the R1S, R1T and Rivian Commercial Van (RCV), with the R2 SUV prepping for mass production next year.

For a startup factory, it’s a very busy place, as shown in a new video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything.

Rivian is still very much a startup, but its first factory in Normal, Illinois, is anything but a boring place. In fact, it’s quite busy, as shown in a new video from famous smartphone durability tester and EV enthusiast JerryRigEverything.

He got a chance to visit the place where the R1S, R1T and commercial van are being assembled, and it’s pretty cool to watch an entire vehicle being brought to life under a single roof.

It all starts with several giant Komatsu sheet metal stamping presses that were originally installed in the factory three decades ago. And no, Rivian was not around back then, but Mitsubishi was, and it used the same factory and presses to build cars like the Eclipse and Mirage, before closing the facility in 2016 and selling it to Rivian in 2017.

Now, dozens of robots are being used throughout the plant for precision tasks and tough jobs, including gluing the two sides of the hood together, wielding entire side profiles through the air and welding all sorts of metal parts.

Laser welding is widely used for a bunch of different sections, from body parts to battery packs. Speaking of batteries, Rivian assembles the packs for the R1T, R1S and electric delivery van in-house in Normal. The electric motors are also made in the same factory, and it’s pretty mesmerizing to see how they‘re put together.

Rivian uses liquid nitrogen to cool the motor’s rotator shaft to a chilling temperature of -321 degrees Fahrenheit (-196 degrees Celsius), while the rotator body is expanded using heat. The components are then press-fitted together, and after their temperatures normalize, the two are bonded.

Final assembly is handled by humans, using all sorts of tools, so that employees don’t break their backs.

It’s a busy place, with three models being assembled under the same roof. As someone who has had the chance to visit several car factories around the world, I can say that Rivian’s plant in Normal, Illinois, is a hybrid between traditional assembly plants and the factories of the future. There are a lot of robots handling high-precision repeatable jobs, as well as tasks that require heavy lifting, but people are also involved in the final steps of assembly.

Either way, it’s always fascinating to see a car being built, even if it’s through a YouTube video. Plus, even the golf carts and robots are painted in Rivian Blue, which is quite cool.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/W8762j/s1/rivian-factory-in-normal-illinois.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:30.467226
,Detroit Environment,2025-10-07 17:12:29+00:00,Crain's Detroit Business,Peter Scher reflects on JPMorgan Chase's $200M bet on Detroit,"Crain's Detroit Business, www.facebook.com, Anna Fifelski",,,,,https://www.crainsdetroit.com/banking-finance/peter-scher-reflects-jpmorgan-chases-200m-bet-detroit,"Can you share a bit about the origin story of JPMorgan's investment in Detroit?
When I first got to Detroit in the fall of 2013, you didn't want to walk around at night.
And one of the main reasons, probably the most important reason, in making this investment was our confidence in the leadership of Mayor Duggan.
Our deposits in the city of Detroit have grown by close to $30 billion.
We see where we may need to sort of tweak the skills and the training, and Detroit at Work works with us.","Can you share a bit about the origin story of JPMorgan's investment in Detroit? Why Detroit?

After the financial crisis in 2009, we were really rethinking how we showed up in communities, because there was a lot of fair criticism that banks and others got bailed out of the crisis, and a lot of communities were left high and dry, and we began rethinking how we should approach our work in communities that we could support them within. And so we were in that process for a year or two, and then where it came together for me was in the summer of 2013.

Jamie Dimon, my boss, the CEO, I was summoned to his office, and he said, ""Are you following what's going on in Detroit?"" And frankly, I said, ""Not really."" And he said, ""They just entered the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the country, and I want you to go out there and see if there's anything we can do to help."" And that was literally how it got teed up.

He said, ""I'm not thinking about charity. Are there investments that we can make?""

And so we brought teams in to really identify areas that the community was focused on, that we thought we could help accelerate and catalyze and scale some of the solutions. Things like affordable housing, big focus on workforce skills and the gap. We focused, not as much initially, but eventually, on small business, neighborhood development, all the issues of blight, how you dealt with vacant and abandoned property.

So we identified a number of areas and when the mayor came into office, we then started engaging with him and said, ""Here are some of our ideas."" And Mayor Duggan had some of his own ideas and we continued to work together, and in May of 2014 we announced an initial $100 million dollar investment in the city.

Was that your first time in Detroit? What connections did you have to the city before this effort and what's your view of the city now?

I had certainly been to Detroit before, but had not spent a huge amount of time there, probably the last time I had really spent any time in Detroit before that was the late '80s.

When I first got to Detroit in the fall of 2013, you didn't want to walk around at night. Now, the streets are filled. It's hard to get restaurant reservations, there’s a great food scene, great night life. It's a vibrant, growing city. One of the things I love is the fact that a lot of young people are moving into the city and are sort of adding to it. So it's just a night and day difference.

When did you meet Mike Duggan for the first time? How did your relationship, which seems to be almost a partnership, grow?

The first time I met the mayor, it was early 2014, so he was probably only mayor for a few weeks at that point, and Jamie Dimon had called him and said that we had been looking at the city, and we were potentially interested in making some investments.

We sat down, and he — one of the things he did, I'll never forget — he pulled out maps of the city neighborhoods. One of the things I remember he said at that first meeting was that Detroit can't come back unless the neighborhoods come back. So this couldn't just be like, ""Let's bring back downtown."" And so we spent a lot of time looking at maps, talking about places like Corktown, where we now have a branch, and the potential there. It was really looking at, how do we, neighborhood by neighborhood, get the blight cleaned up and turn over vacant properties?

What surprised me, because I spent a lot of time talking to mayors, working with mayors, was the level of detail of what needed to be done, and a level of focus on how we could help. It's just been an extraordinary partnership for almost 12 years.

The last thing JPMorgan wanted to do is show up in a place like Detroit, or any place else, and say, ""Hey, we're the guys from Wall Street. We're here to fix all your problems."" We can only help accelerate and scale and bring some of our knowledge and expertise from other places, but it's got to be led by the city. And one of the main reasons, probably the most important reason, in making this investment was our confidence in the leadership of Mayor Duggan.

How did its Detroit push pay off for the company?

Our deposits in the city of Detroit have grown by close to $30 billion. Our book of loans has grown; our mortgage lending, and small business lending have all grown.

We really approached this and thought about it like we thought about a business investment, and I think the most important lesson, for us, was that if you want to create sustainable growth — and there's always a role for philanthropy, but if a city is completely reliant on philanthropy to grow, it's not going to work. It's not sustainable. The reality is, if you look at it, there were billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal government, from the state government, that went into Detroit over 20 years before it filed bankruptcy. But there were no sustainable business investments.

When you first go in, you want to make some part of what we call lower-cost capital, but now it's a vibrant market, and you've got others, other banks, other institutions, investing in the city. And that's what you want. You want to create this environment in which other investors see an opportunity, a long-term opportunity, and our decision and our announcement back in 2014 was a way of saying to the others, ""We believe in the long-term prospects of the city. We believe in the leadership of Mike Duggan. We see how he is bringing together, you know, the business community and the community organizations, civic organizations, they're not fighting with each other, you know, they're really focused on making it a better city."" It's something, frankly, we were really excited about and now very proud to be a partner.

What did JPMorgan learn from the experience of its ""virtual"" call center in Corktown that trained up Detroiters to do decent-paying telephone customer service work?

We're continuing to expand. We continue to grow in Detroit. We've continued to grow in Baltimore. We now have an Atlanta Virtual Call Center, and we also have a true virtual call center that we're actually employing military spouses, who often have to move around so they can have employment no matter where they go. We're actually getting the same or better quality calls at lower costs. From a business perspective, you couldn't ask for a better model, so we will continue to expand it, and it all started in Detroit.

We actually hired more than we anticipated, because there were so many well-qualified applicants, and Detroit at Work has been a really important partner to us throughout the time of this. We see where we may need to sort of tweak the skills and the training, and Detroit at Work works with us. And so we're seeing that it builds on the efficiency of the call center. So one of the most important lessons for us in creating these was to have the right partner, like we had in the mayor and in Detroit at work.

Throughout your career, you’ve been deeply involved in policy and politics. What's your view of the current global and U.S. situation and where we are going?

Politics right now has become this kind of blood sport, and if you pick a team, everything about your team is right and everything about the other team is wrong. I think this is what you saw in Detroit for a long time before Mayor Duggan was elected, and I think people are tired of the kind of partisan warfare that they're seeing. I saw a poll the other day about the shutdown, and people blamed both parties. I mean, people generally are saying, ""Whatever your issues are, it's not worth shutting down the government."" And you saw the same thing in Lansing.

To me, what Detroit represents is a sense that people want something different here. Here's a mayor who came in and said, ""We're not, I'm not going to do us versus them. That drove us into bankruptcy. I'm going to work with anyone who wants to be part of it. I'm going to work with Democrats. I'm going to work with Republicans. I’m going to work with the city council.""

And the fact that here's a white guy that gets elected in a predominantly Black city and gets reelected and is leaving office with an 84% approval rating, one of the things that says is, while people are stuck in this partisan grudge match, at some level, they don’t want it.

They want something different, and to see what the city has been able to accomplish by getting beyond that kind of politics and focusing on what really matters and creating jobs and training people and bringing in investment, to me, is a great example that I wish more people in Washington and other places around the country would look at and say, ""This is the kind of leadership people want.""

What's next for you? Do you see any future connection with Detroit?

Right now, I've been focused on retirement. I plan to stay actively engaged on several boards, and I care deeply about public policy, and I'm going to spend some time figuring out what's next for me.

I'll retire in the spring. I'll remain an advisor to Jamie throughout the year. I'm on several boards, and my family and I want to take some trips, and we'll see. There's still some gas in this tank, and we'll see where it leads me.

What does a weaker Marine Mammal Protection Act mean for whales?
Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed in 1972, species like sea otters, whales, seals and more have recovered from population loss.","Out among the crashing ocean surf, half a dozen dolphins leap out of the water together in perfect sync. A humpback whale dives into the depths, flipping its iconic tail. Sea otters bob and float on a bed of kelp, holding paws.

Seeing these ocean animals swimming in the wild waves would fill your heart with wonder.

But a new bill in Congress would weaken the Mammal Protection Act, gutting protections for all sea creatures, including dolphins, sea otters, manatees, seals, sea lions and endangered whales.

For some of these species, especially many whale species on the brink of extinction, threats to the Marine Mammal Protection Act could be a threat to their very existence.

What does the Marine Mammal Protection Act do?

Since 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act’s goal has been to restore and maintain healthy populations of species in America’s oceans by banning the harassment, hunting, capturing and killing of marine mammals.

And, it’s been incredibly successful. This law has helped to stop the decline of humpback whales, gray seals and California sea lions, to name a few.

These creatures still face threats like vessel collisions, which are reducing the populations of whale species. But, because of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are legally protected from being killed by industries.

What does a weaker Marine Mammal Protection Act mean for whales?

The proposed change would allow industries to kill and harm more marine mammals, and make it more difficult for government agencies to react to early indications of a species in decline.

Take the North Atlantic Right whale for example. With an estimated 370 Right whales alive today, they’re teetering too close to extinction as it is. Allowing more Right whales to be killed could wipe them out forever.

Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed in 1972, species like sea otters, whales, seals and more have recovered from population loss. But if we weaken protections, all the progress we’ve made for these species could be reversed.

What can we do to save whales?

We’re working to raise awareness about the challenges whales are facing. And, we’re urging Congress not to reverse the progress sea creatures, particularly whales, have made.

Now is the time to speak up for whales, before the protections vanish and our precious wildlife suffers and disappears. Before it’s too late.

The best way you can help protect whales right now is by sending a message to your legislator to encourage them not to reverse the progress we’ve made together on conservation.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_1218839440.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:02:50.800274

Crux announced today it will purchase the Boston firm Daedaline. Founded in 2023, Crux is building software to make the systems related to investment in clean energy projects more efficient.

The company’s platform will repurpose Daedaline’s software to streamline due diligence in financing, per Crux’s DC-based CEO and cofounder Alfred Johnson. That refers to the process of verifying information and assessing potential risks before a significant transaction. Johnson believes that undertaking is the most arduous part of getting energy infrastructure investment.

“People just want to do these deals as well and as quickly as possible,” Johnson told Technical.ly in an exclusive interview, “and they want to use whatever tools are best available to them to do it.”

Johnson, whose company’s prior funders include Lowercarbon Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, declined to disclose the financial details of the deal and Crux’s valuation.

The Daedaline brand will be subsumed into Crux with no layoffs, he said. Instead, the New York-headquartered startup’s staff is set to grow from its current near-60 headcount to between 80 and 90 employees by the end of 2025.

Crux provides tools for negotiating terms sheets and due diligence in its “data room,” a term for its secure portal for sensitive business documents. Crux relaunched the feature in March for its 1,000 developers and investors using the platform, and jumped from 20% to 80% adoption, per Johnson.

This acquisition does not mean an expansion of products or services, but Johnson hopes Daedaline’s software will make associated procedures faster. Crux was considering developing software similar to the Boston startup’s, and Johnson was drawn to Daedaline’s expertise and staff.

Expected success despite political headwinds

Crux’s first product — a marketplace for financial institutions, clean energy developers and tax credit buyers to sell and transfer tax credits‚— was spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Despite President Donald Trump’s efforts to cancel clean energy projects across the country, including targeting states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Johnson is confident Crux will continue to be successful. The administration has taken specific aim at wind and solar, but is looking to nuclear to address skyrocketing power needs.

The startup also offers more than tax credit-focused tools. Other features focus on debt capital offerings, which can also fund these energy projects.

“The real driver of that market is the fact that electricity prices have gone up, and energy demand is higher than it’s ever been,” said Johnson, who previously worked in the Department of the Treasury during the Biden presidency. “So, a ton of manufacturing infrastructure is still required.”

Economic benefits for streamlined diligence

A typical tax credit transaction can take three-to-12 weeks of diligence, hundreds of hours and thousands in cash, Johnson explained. That’s why this acquisition is important.

“The more we can help [clients] with that process, extract information, deliver insights, support it with context,” Johnson said, “the better decisions they can make the more rapidly.”

The AI software will extract context and key information for users, he said. For example, in deal documents, the technology can provide guidance like recommendations to swap out clauses.

(October 7th, 2025) — U.S. Congressmen Sean Casten (IL-06) and Mike Levin (CA-49), co-chairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, led 163 House Democrats in a letter to Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright condemning the termination of $8 billion of projects that were set to lower electricity costs for Americans and increase grid reliability. The lawmakers further demanded that DOE immediately reinstate the projects.

“The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation,” the lawmakers wrote. “Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap, clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.”

On October 2nd, DOE announced it would terminate 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects, in 136 Congressional districts, including 108 represented by Democrats and 28 represented by Republicans, accounting for approximately $8 billion. The terminated projects were intended to lower energy costs for consumers, improve grid reliability, create jobs, and strengthen the United States' global leadership in energy innovation.

A recent report found that Americans in at least 41 states and Washington, D.C., have seen increased electricity and natural gas costs under the Trump Administration. The terminations are the latest action in the Trump Administration’s war on cheap energy.

Dear Secretary Wright,

We write to condemn the Department of Energy’s (DOE) termination of 321 financial awards, supporting 223 projects supporting energy resilience across the country. We are deeply concerned about your Department’s attempt to rebrand the elimination of U.S. clean energy as “$7.56 billion in savings” to taxpayers and the potential political motivations behind the targeting of projects in Democratic-leaning states

This decision is a reversal of properly awarded projects that will harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge. This Administration’s decision to play political games will result in genuine harm at a time when millions of American families are already struggling to pay their electricity bills amidst the everrising cost of living. These blatantly partisan cancellations must immediately be reversed.

The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation. Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.

Your press statement claims these projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment.” That is a pretext for cancellations that track political talking points, not facts. Many of these awards had already passed rigorous review, and many of those had already been processed. Companies hired workers, signed contracts, broke ground, and put up private capital in reliance on DOE commitments. Calling that “savings” ignores stranded equipment orders, canceled subcontracts, and layoffs—real costs that ripple through American supply chains. Instead of executing Congress’s direction to build U.S. energy leadership and grid reliability, DOE is moving the goalposts while terminating the very projects that would deliver results.

The consequences of these actions are significant: cancellations will shutter facilities, kill jobs, and stall critical domestic manufacturing. They also inject avoidable uncertainty into energy markets—forcing investors to consider political risks that you have created, which raises financing costs. Terminating grid and manufacturing projects locks in congestion and supplychain bottlenecks, which will lead to higher long-term electricity prices for households and businesses.

We are at a moment of unprecedented growth in electricity demand, which is expected to increase by 25% by 2030. At a time when more energy supply is needed than ever, these cuts will only exacerbate upward pressure on electricity prices by stranding low-cost supply, delaying grid expansion, and increasing reliance on higher-cost imports. In your confirmation hearing, you pledged to pursue “all sources of affordable, reliable energy” to meet these challenges. By terminating awards for cheap energy solutions and those that strengthen the grid, you are going against your word and worsening the very problem you promised to help solve.

Eliminating the Grid Deployment Office and Office of Clean Energy Deployment projects delays transmission and weakens grid resilience, a shortsighted decision that threatens even steeper increasing costs to American consumers and businesses in the future. Additionally, these socalled “savings” waste sunk federal and state dollars and betray disadvantaged communities by erasing critical work to reduce pollution and improve energy affordability.

Fifteen years ago, China generated less electricity than the United States. Today, China generates more than twice as much as we do —and the gap continues to grow. As China and other nations continue to innovate and build the energy technologies of the future, this is precisely the wrong time for the U.S. to back out and cede our technological leadership. The rest of the world will continue to innovate with or without us, and these grant terminations will only set our innovation back at a pivotal time.

It is difficult for us to believe that these project terminations were anything but a partisan targeting of states that are not politically aligned with this Administration. These terminations undermine the spirit of competitive, merit-based awards and throw into question the fairness of the award process under this Administration.

As such, we demand that DOE take the following immediate actions by Tuesday, October 14, 2025:

Suspend all terminations and de-obligations and reinstate the projects.

Provide a complete list of affected awards (office, recipient, state, award number, selection date, federal obligation, non-federal cost share, milestone status) along with the project-specific written justification for termination.

Identify the specific statutory and regulatory authorities relied upon for these mass postaward terminations.

Preserve and provide all Department of Energy records, memoranda, and communications related to the review and termination of these awards, including those resulting from the May 2025 Secretarial memorandum “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance.”

Describe DOE’s process for recipient appeals and dispute resolution, including timelines, decision-makers, and whether interim funding will be permitted to avoid waste while appeals are pending.

Dismantling America’s advanced-energy buildout under the banner of “savings” does not protect taxpayers—it subsidizes our competitors. It means higher bills and fewer American jobs. We will utilize every oversight and legislative tool available to ensure the DOE follows the law, honors congressional intent, and keeps the United States at the forefront of the global energy race.

Sincerely,

The German automaker sold 12,470 ID.4s between July and September, almost three times the 4,518 units it sold during the same period in 2024, according to recent numbers released by Volkswagen of America.

This spike coincided with the end of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which were worth $7,500 for new cars and up to $4,000 for used ones. Those expired on Sept. 30.

In January, the company said the ID.4 no longer qualified for the $7,500 EV tax credit because of escalating requirements for the local sourcing of battery components and materials. A VW spokesperson, Michael Lowder, said in July the company was working with suppliers to get the SUV to once again qualify. Leases for the vehicle, however, were still eligible.

District 7 released a statement criticizing the Donald Trump administration’s plan to terminate millions in clean energy infrastructure grants, including one for the Indianapolis International Airport.

According to a news release from Carson’s office, Carson said he was notified that the Federal Aviation Administration is planning to terminate a grant for the Indianapolis airport that would help fund a solar power battery storage facility at the site. The FAA said that the grant did “not align with the (Trump) administration’s priorities.”

The Indianapolis International Airport received federal funds in July 2023 that officials said they would use to construct energy-efficient infrastructure and the installation of solar panels. At the time, airport officials said that the grant was for $22.58 million for the project and “a huge win for the Indy airport, our environment and our community.”

In Carson’s release, he said the Trump administration’s plan is to terminate almost $37 million in clean energy infrastructure plants, including a $6.7 million grant for the airport.

In the statement, Carson said that Trump is “taking money away from Indianapolis to score cheap political points in Washington.” Carson said this is a “blow to the hardworking aviation professionals” at the Indianapolis airport.

“Republicans and Democrats have long supported this project because it is economically viable and environmentally intelligent,” Carson said. “It provides renewable energy to the electric grid, lowers emissions, improves air quality, and lowers the airport’s operating costs… Infrastructure should not be partisan. There are no Democratic or Republican bridges, roads, or airports. Clean solar energy serves everyone, especially through the Indianapolis Airport solar farm.”

According to previous reports, the funding was expected to help fund the first 25% of a multi-phased project to transition the airport terminal’s electricity consumption to renewable energy generated onsite.

In a statement from the Indianapolis International Airport, officials said:

We can confirm that we no longer have the commitment by the federal government of this clean energy grant. The Indianapolis Airport Authority did not receive the dollars associated with this project and had not begun nominal work on it yet. We remain in good financial stability, and, with this news, we are adjusting our priorities for critical infrastructure projects. We continue to be committed to working with the Federal Aviation Administration and our elected officials, like Congressman André Carson, on future funding opportunities when they become available.

The new base Model Y is what Tesla started teasing in social media posts over the weekend, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The cheaper vehicle will lack certain features and use less premium materials to offset the loss of the up to $7,500 federal tax credit that the US stopped offering as of this month, the people said.

Tesla representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment. The company’s posts on X helped send its shares up 5.4% on Monday. The stock has risen 12% this year.

Tesla executives said during the company’s most recent earnings call that while production of a more affordable model started in June, they decided to put off ramping up output until after the US phased out tax credits. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja and Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, were cryptic about what the car will be before Elon Musk let loose.

“It’s the Model Y,” Musk said, joking that he would “let the cat out of the bag.”

“The desire to buy the car is very high, it’s just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it,” Musk continued. “So, the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

Tesla managed to engineer cost out of the Model Y in part by focusing on the battery pack and motor, the people said.

The company announced last week that it delivered 497,099 vehicles worldwide from July through September, a record quarterly total. While the tax credit expiration boosted sales, the pull-forward effect could undermine EV demand in the months to come. Musk himself warned in July that Tesla could be in for “a few rough quarters” after US incentives end.

Vice Chair

Cushman & Wakefield

Indianapolis

With over 22 years of experience in the commercial real estate industry, Michael Weishaar, SIOR, Vice Chair at Cushman & Wakefield’s Indianapolis office, has established himself as a preeminent leader in the industrial sector. His career is marked by significant milestones, unwavering dedication, and a deep commitment to his community—qualities that define a Hall of Fame honoree.

In the past eight years alone, Weishaar and his team have completed nearly 900 leasing and investment sale transactions, totaling over $7 billion in value. Their work spans more than 111.5 million square feet of industrial property, serving some of the most respected names in real estate, third-party logistics, and corporate America, including Prologis, Hines, DRA, Becknell Industrial, Red Rock Developments, and LXP.

Weishaar’s success stems from his passion for the dynamic nature of the industry.

“What I find most enjoyable is the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, big and small,” he said.

For him, the appeal lies in the variety and constant challenge the commercial real estate world offers.

“Every day is different,” Weishaar said, emphasizing the entrepreneurial opportunities that come with the business.

A key turning point in Weishaar’s career was mastering the art of focus.

“Early on, you want to say yes to everything,” he said. “But over time, you learn to delegate and recognize when an opportunity doesn’t align with your expertise.”

This ability to prioritize and streamline efforts has been instrumental in Weishaar’s sustained success.

Balancing professional demands with personal life is another challenge he has navigated throughout his career.

“Real estate is a business without a clock,” Weishaar said.

The shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic further blurred the lines between work and home life. While he acknowledges that achieving the perfect work-life balance is an elusive goal, setting boundaries has been crucial in managing both worlds.

Outside of work, Weishaar is deeply involved in giving back to his community. He has served in leadership roles within his church and the Carmel Dads’ Club, a youth sports program where he coached basketball and baseball. He also serves as an advisor to the Indiana chapter of NAIOP and supports the Lambda Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity at Indiana University. His philanthropic efforts have earned him the Civilian Patriotic Service Award from the U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs for his contributions to the Department of Defense.

Weishaar’s personal life is rooted in family. He enjoys spending time with his wife, Tabatha, and their two children, Landon and Lainey. Together, they explore national parks, embark on ski trips, and relax at their lake house.

“We’re also huge Indiana University basketball and football fans,” he said. “Go Hoosiers!”

Reflecting on his journey, Weishaar credits mentorship as a cornerstone of his career.

“When I started, I told my mentor, Jeff Castell, and leaders like Pat Lindley and John Huguenard, that I’d bring a strong work ethic and a can-do attitude every day, but I’d need their help learning the real estate side of things,” he said.

Their guidance, along with the support of others, played a pivotal role in shaping Weishaar’s career and remains a source of inspiration.",https://rejournals.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Rejournals_logo_512-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:23.334846

On Friday the EPA said in a notice that it was withdrawing the delay because the policy wouldn’t create compliance problems for industry after all.
At another U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., a six-month average of emissions of chromium were twice as high as the California standard, EIP said.
U.S. Steel criticized the EPA’s withdrawal of the compliance deadline and said it would consider its next steps.
Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” the company said in a statement.","Public health advocates pushed back when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it planned to delay for two years a requirement that steel companies monitor air quality at the perimeters of their 11 coke plants in Western Pennsylvania and across the country. Two groups sued.

Now, the EPA has reversed course.

The deadline to begin so-called fenceline monitoring for emissions of benzene, chromium and other toxic contaminants, set by the Biden administration, had been in July. On July 8, the Trump EPA extended the deadline until July 2027 in an interim final rule , saying there wasn’t enough time to seek, compile and respond to public comments, potentially forcing some companies into violation.

On Friday the EPA said in a notice that it was withdrawing the delay because the policy wouldn’t create compliance problems for industry after all.

“EPA does not believe that the currently available information supports a conclusion that regulated parties would face significant immediate compliance challenges,” the agency wrote after the nonprofits Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice sued over the matter.

The environmentalists’ lawsuit challenged the rule on the grounds that it deprived people in nearby communities of protection against toxic air pollution. Rather than defend the interim final rule in court, the environmental groups said in a statement, the EPA affirmed its prior finding that coke ovens are fully capable of complying with the rule, “thereby acknowledging that the delay of compliance dates was never needed.”

“We’re glad that EPA recognizes the harm coke oven plants cause to communities and that it is more than reasonable for these facilities to meet emissions standards now,” Adrienne Lee, a senior Earthjustice attorney, said in a statement. “The health and wellbeing of impacted communities should not come at the cost of giving corporate polluters a pass.”

An August report from the Environmental Integrity Project examined preliminary testing the Biden administration required steel and coke plants to conduct. EIP found that emissions of benzene, a carcinogen, from U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works near Pittsburgh were up to eight times higher than a California standard, which the group used as a national benchmark because many states don’t have ambient air-quality standards. At another U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., a six-month average of emissions of chromium were twice as high as the California standard, EIP said.

Two people died and 10 were injured in an explosion at the Clairton plant in August. The facility has been fined more than $10 million by the EPA for environmental violations in the last three years, more than any other plant on a list of 20 surveyed by EIP.

U.S. Steel criticized the EPA’s withdrawal of the compliance deadline and said it would consider its next steps.

“U. S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law, and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts. Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” the company said in a statement.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1195315686-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:00.769129

Nuclear energy is gaining recognition as a vital solution to meet the world’s increasing electricity needs while supporting the transition to cleaner energy sources. Unlike solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions, nuclear power offers a stable and reliable supply of carbon-free energy throughout the year. The restart of a previously shuttered U.S. nuclear plant underscores the technology’s renewed momentum and the rising investor interest in nuclear energy stocks.

The Nuclear industry is benefiting from the new regulatory reforms, ongoing research and development work, leading to the development of microreactors and small modular reactors. The 24x7 immense clean power requirements from the AI-based new data centers and the reshoring of some industries are creating fresh demand. The government is also working to increase the domestic supply of uranium, a fuel essential to power the nuclear plants.

With this increasing importance, nuclear energy-related stocks, such as BWX Technologies (BWXT), Dominion Energy (D) and Duke Energy (DUK), are becoming attractive investment options. Unlike other clean energy sources affected by intermittency, nuclear power plants provide a consistent and stable energy output, operating around the clock except during planned maintenance intervals.

Demand for clean energy is rising, and as per the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), energy supply from nuclear power is expected to nearly double between 2020 and 2050, helping utilities meet the rising demand for clean energy. The IEA also highlights that while large nuclear reactors will dominate overall power generation, small modular reactors (SMRs) are projected to experience significant expansion.

Compared with other clean energy sources, nuclear power plants use far less land to produce an equivalent amount of clean electricity. Moreover, while all conventional energy sources generate waste, nuclear energy is unique in its systematic and secure management and storage of that waste. Increasing adoption of electric vehicles, rising demand from the power grids and development of large artificial intelligence-powered data centers.

As the production of clean energy is expected to rise from nuclear plants, a continuous supply of high-quality uranium is essential to keep the nuclear units running. Companies like Uranium Energy (UEC) and BHP Group Limited (BHP) produce large volumes of uranium and can benefit from the surging demand from nuclear power plants.

Nuclear Energy stocks have a huge potential in the energy space and can offer significant growth opportunities for investors. Our Nuclear Energy Screen makes it easier for investors to locate high-potential stocks at any given time. Apart from the stocks mentioned above, investors can also explore stocks like The Southern Company (SO) and NextEra Energy (NEE) for further growth in the nuclear energy space.

After the Trump administration canceled $7 billion in solar energy grants, nonprofits, solar companies, unions, and homeowners have banded together to sue the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Solar for All program was designed to help middle- and low-income families install solar panels on their homes. The Biden administration estimated that the successful completion of the program would give 900,000 households access to solar energy. The groups suing the E.P.A. claim that the agency illegally canceled the grants without approval from Congress. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Rhode Island’s federal court, follows a similar lawsuit filed last month, which an appeals court ruled against. Legal experts, however, are doubtful that this current lawsuit will have a similar outcome. Recently, the Energy Department canceled an additional $7.5 billion for renewable energy projects, primarily affecting states led by Democrats.

Renewable sources generate more energy than coal worldwide

Global think tank Ember released a report Tuesday stating that renewable energy has surpassed coal in energy generation for the first time. This is largely due to the rapid growth of the renewable sector in China and India. According to the report, China increased its solar energy output by 43% and wind power generation by 26%, resulting in a 2% decrease in fossil fuel use. Similarly, India increased its solar energy output by 31% and wind power generation by 29%, resulting in a 3.1% reduction in fossil fuel use. In the first half of 2025, coal supplied 4,896 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy, while renewables exceeded that with 5,072 TWh. Despite this positive growth in renewables around the world, the EU and the U.S. increased coal generation by 1.1% and 17%, respectively.

NiSource Investment Narrative Recap

To be a NiSource shareholder, you need to believe in the company’s ability to capture accelerating electricity demand, particularly from large data center clients, while maintaining regulatory support to fund major capital investments. The approval of GenCo’s declination petition directly addresses a key short-term catalyst by unlocking a pathway to meet new load growth, though the risk of high capital expenditure still looms and could influence margins and future dividends. For now, the regulatory win may help support near-term outlook, but won’t eliminate longer-term headwinds around future gas demand or leverage.

Among recent announcements, the steady quarterly dividend declaration, US$0.28 per share in August, stands out because dividend sustainability is closely tied to cost management and regulatory clarity, both of which GenCo’s approval is designed to reinforce. How effectively GenCo delivers on its “financial stability” pillar will directly impact free cash flow and NiSource’s ability to balance growth investments with investor returns. In contrast, investors should be aware that substantial capital needs for GenCo and grid modernization may still constrain...

First, the EPA plans on finalizing the following actions: Listing of Specific PFAS as Hazardous Constituents Under RCRA.
Next, the EPA plans to clarify the following actions: PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Rulemaking.
Finally, the EPA is spearheading the following new actions: PFAS Requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Applications.","As the Trump Administration rolls back Biden-era regulations, all eyes have been on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as it determines if and how it will enforce the Biden Administration's regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The Trump Administration has offered insight into its direction through responses to ongoing litigation against the rules. (See previous Holland & Knight alert, ""The PFAS Drinking Water Rule Under the Second Trump Administration,"" April 16, 2025.)

Now, the EPA has released their most definitive guidance to date with the announcement that it will retain the Biden-era designation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund).

The EPA's broader regulatory trajectory is detailed in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) recently released Unified Regulatory Agenda, which outlines seven upcoming PFAS-related actions at varying stages in the rulemaking process and utilizes a broad range of legislative authorities. These actions span multiple environmental statutes, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and Clean Water Act (CWA). The rulemakings provide further insight into the Trump Administration's trajectory on PFAS regulations.

CERCLA Designation

The EPA announced on Sept. 17, 2025, that it would retain the Biden-era designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA with the intention of ""holding polluters accountable"" for cleanup costs. The EPA has opted to defend the Biden EPA's final rule in ongoing litigation. In tandem with their announcement, the EPA submitted an unopposed motion to lift the ongoing abeyance, as the agency has completed its review of the rule and made a decision to keep it in place, which was allowed on Oct. 2, 2025, and set a deadline of Dec. 5, 2025, for final briefs.

Though the EPA plans to defend the CERCLA Rule to provide more regulatory certainty, the EPA intends to develop a CERCLA Section 102(a) Framework Rule governing future CERCLA hazardous substance designations. This rule will instill a uniform approach to designations and require the EPA to consider the costs of proposed designations. In addition to this regulatory fix, the EPA called on Congress to take further action to protect passive receivers from liability through statutory action guided by technical assistance from the EPA. At least one bill has been introduced that would provide liability protection for water utilities. The prospects for legislative relief for other large categories of passive receivers – such as farmers who apply biosolids – remain unclear.

Regulatory Unified Agenda

Earlier in September 2025, the OMB released its biannual Regulatory Unified Agenda. This agenda provides insight into the Trump Administration's upcoming regulatory activities, including a timeline for their release, and revealing a coordinated, multi-statute strategy to require reporting and/or limit PFAS discharges under CWA, RCRA, TSCA and SDWA.

The Regulatory Unified Agenda features seven upcoming PFAS actions, many of which finalize or clarify actions initiated during the Biden Administration, but the EPA also includes two new actions to further regulate PFAS.

First, the EPA plans on finalizing the following actions:

Listing of Specific PFAS as Hazardous Constituents Under RCRA. In April 2026, the EPA plans to finalize the proposed rule designating nine PFAS compounds, their salts and structural isomers to the list of hazardous constituents under RCRA. This will require corrective action for releases of these substances. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Proposes RCRA Corrective Action Expansions Targeting PFAS,"" Feb. 14, 2024.) The EPA did not hint at any potential revisions of the rule, only stating it is considering public comments as it develops the final version of the rule. EPA also plans to finalize (potentially at the same time as this listing) its proposed rule clarifying that RCRA's statutory definition of ""hazardous waste"" applies to corrective actions at solid waste management units. As a practical matter, this clarification would apply RCRA's corrective action authorities not only to PFAS chemicals listed as hazardous constituents but to any PFAS chemical that meets the broader statutory definition of ""hazardous waste.""

Addition of Certain PFAS to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). In February 2026, the EPA plans to finalize a rule to add individual PFAS and PFAS categories to the TRI and finalize the criteria needed for PFAS to be automatically added to the TRI. In the meantime, the EPA announced on Oct. 7, 2025, the addition of the chemical perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS-Na) to the list of substances subject to TRI reporting, bringing the total number of PFAS subject to TRI reporting to 206.

Clarification to Supplier Notification Provision Due to Automatic Additions of PFAS to the TRI. In November 2025, the EPA plans to finalize edits to the TRI guidelines to align supplier notification provisions with the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act's (NDAA) requirement for the EPA to annually add new PFAS compounds to the TRI. These revisions would explicitly require covered suppliers to notify customers receiving products containing chemicals newly added to the TRI, namely PFAS compounds, of their presence as soon as these compounds are added to the list on Jan. 1 of each year. In practice, this means suppliers will be required to notify customers of the presence of these compounds as early as the first shipment of each calendar year.

Next, the EPA plans to clarify the following actions:

PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Rulemaking. In October 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rule to extend the deadline for public water systems to comply with the April 2024 National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) setting Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFAS. Additionally, this action will solidify the revisions announced in May 2025, which would narrow the regulation to only applying to PFOS and PFOA. This revision eliminates perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) (commonly known as GenX), along with the Hazard Index mixture of these three PFAS plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), from the original reporting and mitigation requirements. This revision significantly reduces the number of PFAS compounds subject to monitoring and mitigation, potentially easing compliance burdens for public water systems.

PFAS Data Reporting and Recordkeeping under TSCA. In December 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rule to revise an October 2023 final rule requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS to report data about their usage of such substances between 2011 and 2022 under TSCA. The upcoming action, which is currently undergoing interagency review, is likely to create exemptions for certain uses and modify the scope of reporting. Based on previous EPA actions to extend the data submission deadline for manufacturers granting further leniency for small manufacturers reporting as article importers, it is likely that the EPA will create exemptions for these importers. The EPA has also opened additional opportunities for public comment on the October 2023 action, stressing a need for critical feedback on data collection software and desired guidance. Manufacturers and importers should monitor this rulemaking closely, particularly if they qualify as small entities or import PFAS-containing articles, as exemptions may reduce reporting obligations.

Finally, the EPA is spearheading the following new actions:

PFAS Requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Applications. In November 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rulemaking to update NPDES to require permit applications to include monitoring and reporting for PFAS discharges. Facilities in the plastics, chemical and synthetic fiber sectors should prepare for expanded monitoring and discharge limitations under these forthcoming rules.

PFAS Requirements in Effluent Limitation Guidelines. Following through on Effluent Guidelines Plan 15, in January 2026, the EPA plans to propose a rulemaking to revise the Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards to address PFAS discharges from manufacturing facilities.

Next Steps

The fate of other recent PFAS-related EPA actions – including the proposed 2026 Multi-Sector General Permit (which included PFAS monitoring requirements for certain sectors), draft recommended ambient water quality criteria for PFOA, PFOS and PFBS, and draft risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS in biosolids – remain unclear.

Industries across the supply chain should anticipate heightened scrutiny as EPA advances rulemakings that will expand monitoring, reporting and corrective action requirements for PFAS, particularly in manufacturing, water treatment and waste management sectors. Regulatory uncertainty persists around several key federal initiatives, including PFAS-related permit requirements and biosolids risk assessments. Moreover, states continue to promulgate PFAS measures of their own, adding to this uncertainty.

Enova stated that it has revised its requirements to open funding for ammonia- and hydrogen-propulsion retrofit projects. The maritime industry is crucial to the global economy as 90% of the world’s goods are transported by sea.

The Viking nation has plans to completely revolutionize the maritime industry

The maritime sector plays an integral role in the global supply chain. Nearly every sector in the world relies on the vast shipping industry to transport goods to every corner of the planet.

Taking that into account, the large shipping vessels that transport our goods use massive amounts of fuel, and as such, produce vast amounts of harmful greenhouse gases. So it became evidently clear that something had to be done to shift the maritime industry towards the growing renewable energy sector.

Norwegian state-owned Enova has delivered a potential solution to the problem. It recently announced that, from next year, existing vessels scheduled for retrofits with ammonia or hydrogen-capable primary propulsion will be eligible for funding. Even those who do not operate the fuel continuously will be eligible for financial support.

“The changes give more people the opportunity to seek support, Even vessels with a shorter lifespan can help cut emissions and build experience,” – Norwegian state-owned company, Enova

Enova has awarded approximately $75.5 million to projects developing hydrogen and ammonia-powered vessels

The move underscores the importance of transitioning the maritime sector to renewable energy usage. The reports coming out of Norway state that four companies that intend to construct hydrogen-powered ships will receive a total of $50.5 million, while the remaining $25 million is reserved for the construction of two ammonia-powered ships.

As part of the revision of the scheme, the greenhouse gas emission reduction quota required for new technology projects has been lowered from 100% to 55%. Additionally, Enova also stated that it has extended the application deadline for funding to build ammonia bunkering infrastructure along the Norwegian coast. In order to qualify, projects must include ammonia storage and refuelling facilities.

“The purpose of the program is to ensure that the bunkering facilities are realised in time for the first vessels to enter the water, probably during 2027,” – Enova

As the cooperative nature of the hydrogen sector fosters new and amazing alliances that have the potential to completely change the landscape of the renewable energy sector in Europe, the move by Enova has been welcomed by industry insiders.

“The technology is still new. Now we will support the industry in building experience. If we are going to succeed in cutting emissions from ocean transportation, we need to go for solutions that can grow in scale towards 2050.” – Nils Kristian Nakstad, Managing Director of Enova

Norway could become a global leader in the renewable energy sector if the plans are successful",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_210036308_XL-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 15:04:07.551357

U.S. sales of electric vehicles topped 1.3 million units in 2024, a 7.3% year-over-year increase, Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book said in a Jan. 13 press release.

Q4 sales set a best-ever quarterly sales mark with 365,824 units sold, a 15.2% YoY improvement, according to the release. Sales benefited from strong automaker incentives and leasing deals, as well as federal and state programs.

Cox Automotive’s report coincides with automakers’ Q4 sales numbers, with many reporting record-breaking domestic sales aided by surging demand for EVs.

While it’s been suggested that the incoming Trump administration may end EV tax credits, which could slow sales growth, Cox Automotive said it would take time for any changes to take effect and the possibility of lost incentives may boost sales in the short term.

With improving charging infrastructure and 15 additional EV models entering the market, sales growth is expected to continue in 2025 with EVs projected to represent nearly 10% of all U.S. vehicle sales this year, Cox Automotive said.

A slew of new EVs, including those from General Motors and Honda Motor Co., which together sold nearly 80,000 more EVs in 2024 than in 2023, provided a boost to last year’s sales, Cox Automotive said. Hyundai Motor Group and Ford Motor Co. also reported increased EV sales last year.

By volume, Tesla sales were estimated to be lower YoY by more than 37,000 units, which was roughly the volume GM added, Cox Automotive reported. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz also posted lower volumes in 2024 compared to 2023.

Cox Automotive said the U.S. EV market is comparably competitive to China and Europe. Of the 68 mainstream EV models tracked by Kelley Blue Book, 24 models saw YoY sales increases; 17 models were new to the market; and 27 decreased in volume, which included discontinued models such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Mazda MX-30.

The Tesla Model Y and Model 3 reigned as the two best-selling EVs in the U.S., though both aging models saw notable sales declines, Cox Automotive said. However, the Model Y and Model 3 still accounted for more than 40% of all EVs sold last year.

Eight plaintiffs filed suit Monday against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its termination of the Solar for All program, alleging that the termination was unconstitutional and caused them harm.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the rescission in August, saying in a post on X, “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost,” the plaintiffs argued.

Dive Insight:

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs are solar installation companies Sunpath Solar and EIS Solar, nonprofits Solar United Neighbors and Black Sun Light Sustainability, environmental consultancy 2KB Energy Services, trade union Rhode Island AFL-CIO, the nonprofit Rhode Island Center for Justice, and Anh Nguyen, a member of Georgia BRIGHT’s Solar for All advisory board.

“Plaintiffs are not direct grantees under the Solar for All program, but rather they are its intended beneficiaries,” the lawsuit said. “They are a labor organization, an individual homeowner seeking access to solar energy to reduce costs, nonprofit organizations dedicated to assisting low-income families with affordable energy, and solar consultants and installers.”

The eight plaintiffs “should have benefited directly from the Solar for All program’s provision of new sources of energy throughout the nation and its electricity cost savings,” according to the lawsuit.

In an August statement posted on YouTube, Zeldin referred to Solar for All as a slush fund and said there was “massive dilution” of the program’s funding disbursements, “as many grants go through pass through after pass through after pass through after pass through, with all of the middlemen taking their own cut.”

An April 2024 announcement from the Biden administration said the program was intended to “deliver residential solar projects to over 900,000 households nationwide” by “[providing] funds to states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits across the country to develop long-lasting solar programs that enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy and benefit from distributed residential solar.”

The plaintiffs argue that the executive branch didn’t have the statutory authority to rescind the $7 billion in funding, even after Congress “repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund” in July, as it “did not repeal the Solar for All program retroactively.”

“Congress rescinded only ‘unobligated balances,’ which preserved all $7 billion of the obligated funding EPA already had awarded through its Solar for All grants,” the lawsuit said. “Instead of distributing the Solar for All funds as Congress directed, Defendants hastily and unlawfully terminated the Solar for All program,” an action the plaintiffs allege was illegal.

Coalitions of large energy users and environmental groups on Monday urged federal regulators to reject the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s proposal for paying for a coal-fired power plant that the U.S. Department of Energy ordered to run past its retirement date.

The issue centers on the 1,560-MW, coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan.

In late May, DOE said MISO faces an “energy emergency” and ordered the owners of the power plant to run it past a planned May 31 shutdown. DOE issued a second 90-day emergency order for the power plant that keeps it online until Nov. 19, with additional extensions possible.

Under the Federal Power Act, DOE can order power plants to operate for 90 days during emergencies. Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of groups, led by the Sierra Club and Earthjustice, have challenged the DOE order in court, saying there isn’t an emergency in the Midcontinent grid operator’s footprint.

In August, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved MISO’s preliminary outline for the Campbell power plant’s owners — Consumers Energy, Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative and the Michigan Public Power Agency — to recover their costs to comply with DOE’s orders.

Now, FERC is weighing the plan itself. The power plant’s owners haven’t asked to recover costs yet.

However, MISO’s cost recovery plan fails to meet the ratemaking principle that parties pay for the costs that they cause, according to filings at FERC.

FERC directed MISO to allocate the power plant’s costs across its central and northern zones on a demand basis, but the grid operator proposed recouping them on an energy basis, according to a coalition that is comprised of the Coalition of MISO Transmission Customers, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, the Midwest Large Energy Consumers and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers.

“Given that the Campbell units are being retained for capacity and resource adequacy purposes under the DOE Order, using an energy based load ratio share instead of a demand based load share deviates from cost causation principles and therefore, is unjust and unreasonable,” the groups said.

They pointed out that FERC has already approved a demand-based cost allocation method for a different plant — Constellation Energy’s Eddystone units in Pennsylvania, which also faces DOE emergency orders.

A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, filed a separate, more expansive challenge to MISO’s cost allocation plan.

The plan recovers costs from utilities across MISO’s northern and central zones — as FERC said it could do — instead of just from Michigan, the Environmental Law & Policy Center, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sustainable FERC Project said.

The DOE order and FERC’s approval of MISO’s cost recovery methodology failed to identify any evidence that utilities or ratepayers in MISO zones 1 through 7 will benefit from Campbell’s continued operation, according to the groups.

“Instead, the commission order relied wholly on the DOE’s unlawful emergency declaration both to determine the scope of cost allocation and as the sole basis for the conclusion that an emergency exists in Zones 1-7,” they said.

Also, MISO’s compliance filing goes beyond FERC’s order by establishing a permanent cost allocation provision that will apply to any future DOE orders affecting the Campbell facility, the groups said.

“While the commission order contemplates extensions of [the] DOE order, it did not give blanket approval to an allocation method where the scope of the … emergency and resulting beneficiaries no longer align with that allocation,” the groups said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aKadooqNDIUJRstwLymSNpanSKKMx30aXe93HMTQhB0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DTVNXZXN0T2xpdmVDYW1wYmVsbDA0MjAyMDE3LTEwNi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:06:40.041251

NYSEG presented the New York Public Service Commission with its ""Powering New York"" proposal in June, including plans to increase customer rates.

Starting May 1, 2026, the proposed increase could mean residential customers using about 600 kilowatt-hours would pay an additional $33.12. Commercial customers using 3,650 kilowatt-hours a month with a 25-kilowatt monthly demand could see an overall $155.37 bill increase. A total 10.9% bill increase for industrial customers could add $8,679.98.

Residential gas customers using 83 therms — the unit of measure for heat energy — could see $33.57 added to their overall bill that year.

NYSEG and RG&E Director of New York Communications Shelby Cohen said the rate increases cover needed upgrades.

Webb joined Assemblywoman Donna Lupardo and the Public Utility Law Project of NY Executive Director and General Counsel Laurie Wheelock on Oct. 1 to encourage residents to voice their concerns for the proposed rate increases at upcoming in-person and virtual hearings in the Southern Tier.

""People aren't just confused and concerned, they're worried,"" Lupardo said. ""They're worried about being able to keep their lights on. They're worried about what it means for their families. They're worried about what it means for them to stay housed.""

How NYSEG will use additional funds

Cohen said the ""Powering New York"" proposal would create 1,100 jobs across New York, including the recruitment of line workers she said would aid in storm costs and limit the use of outside contractors.

The more in-house line workers ""will eventually make storm cost decrease and lower cost in the future for our customers,"" she said.

NYSEG is also targeting investment in areas including energy demand, upgrading aging infrastructure and systems for reliability and customer service, storm/vegetation management expenses, wage requirements, federal and state pipeline safety mandates, and clean energy goals.

As part of addressing the energy demand and aging infrastructure, new transformers have to be made — the custom equipment takes four years to build. The ""skyrocketing"" energy demand, Cohen said, is being seen across the state and requires a grid expansion to keep up with the growing economic development.

In 2022, NYSEG received eight new power requests for the whole division in the Catskills. By 2024, that number jumped to 49 requests, which the company did not anticipate in its last rate case.

""There's a ton of new businesses coming. We've got to upgrade our infrastructure to serve them,"" Cohen said. ""The existing substations serving these areas can't handle that much more power running through them.""

What to know about rate approval process

Cohen said the data included in the proposal supports a five-year plan. In previous years, the multi-year agreement spanned three years, and was switched to five years for better planning.

""We have proposed a multi-year agreement so that we can spread the increases out over multiple years,"" Cohen said.

For example, a NYSEG customer could see the $33.12 applied to their bill in divided, monthly increments instead of one lump-sum fee.

The 11-month rate case process began in July. As of Oct. 1, the company is still in the negotiating stage. The PSC will decide whether the agreement will be approved for a one- or multi-year plan.

At the Oct. 1 event, Webb described the findings from audits and investigations conducted by the PSC as ""very challenging.""

An audit released in May 2025 found 128 corrective actions for NYSEG to address, including cost allocation simplification, revision of the Cost Allocation Manual, a third-party review of individual CEO metrics, new cybersecurity systems, implementation of an asset management system and upgrading customer service operations.

""We are saying NYSEG must get their house in order before asking for another rate hike that our constituents quite frankly can't afford, nor should flip the bill for,"" Webb said.

Electric Era helps C-stores and gas stations secure NEVI funding; adds Love's Travel Stops to list of customers.

Electric Era's path to growth is fueled by their patented battery-backed DC chargers that reduce operating costs up to 70% and cutting installation times from years to months. They've also leveraged their 98%+ guaranteed per-port uptime and start-to-finish project support to help their customers win 83% of the grant applications they've applied for over the past two years – for a total of $41 million worth of incentives.

With federal NEVI funding restored, available state and federal funding programs can cover up to half of charger deployment costs, allowing some retailers to reach positive ROI in less than two years from charging alone. Beyond selling electrons, however, Electric Era's customer-branded chargers with retail program integration add an entirely new revenue stream by turning EV charging into store revenue drivers.

Love's Travel Stops Chooses Electric Era

Love's Travel Stops recently commissioned an Electric Era charging station for their newest location in Buena Vista, Co. along U.S. Highway 24, which serves as a rural connector between Denver and Colorado Springs.

The deployment marks the 38th EV charging location for Love's, which now has more than 150 EV chargers across 15 states while offering refueling customers a wide range of food and beverages, along with Love's in-store Mobile-to-Go Zone, which retails consumer electronics accessories.

""As part of our commitment to sustainability, we're proud to bring this location online as we continue to bring more clean energy solutions to communities across Colorado,"" said Ryan Erickson, vice president of Love's Alternative Energy. ""This new location offers a seamless charging experience for travelers with weather protective canopies, and a variety of fresh food options and clean restrooms.""

Love's secured grant funding from the Colorado Energy Office Direct Current Fast-Charging Plazas program, which leverages both federal NEVI and Colorado state funding to deploy public DC fast charging systems in strategic and underserved areas.

The four-stall, 200 kW chargers are wrapped in Love's signature yellow and red heart brand graphics, feature both CCS1 (Combined Charging System) and NACS (North American Charging Standard) cables.

While lower total cost of ownership (TCO) was Love's initial driver, the long-term upside was compelling. Electric Era's retailer‑focused platform – with integrated brand experiences and loyalty program support – offers Love's the chance to not just break even faster, but to grow store traffic and non-fuel revenues.

""We work with a lot of customers who come to us with a variety of incentive options and business cases that strictly look at the cap-ex and op-ex in relation to the revenue from selling electrons, which is where we started at with Love's,"" said Electric Era Sr. Manager of Enterprise Sales, Brittany Kaplan.

""The best part of this engagement was helping Love's build a broader marketing and loyalty program that accelerates their revenue past break even, and sets them up to generate stronger returns for the long haul.""

Electric Era Full-Service Revenue Growth Experts

Electric Era's founder, Quincy Lee, a former SpaceX engineer, has leveraged innovation and first principles engineering to break down the barriers holding back the rapid growth of public EV charging in America. He recognized deployment complexity as a barrier holding back rapid adoption of EV charging, so he created an in-house deployment team to ""cut red tape"" on behalf of their retail customers.

His team includes project managers and engineers, government/sustainability experts and site selection specialists to help public and private entities navigate the maze of permits, regulations – plus state and federal funding programs, where applicable – to help manage the various stakeholders and applicants optimize incentive opportunities.

With $5 billion in federal NEVI funding restored with a greater emphasis on time-to-deployment, reliability and a focus on traditional refueling locations, more convenience store and fuel retailers are expected to take another look at EV charging to grow revenues today and future proof their businesses against a changing marketplace.

""Despite being grant agnostic, we've had a lot of success helping our customers who wanted to go the incentive route. Now that NEVI is back, we expect more companies like Love's to take a second look at EV charging to grow their businesses,"" Kaplan said. ""Fortunately for us, our solution and business model are aligned with the incentive program requirements for those looking to future proof their businesses.""

Without adequate insurance coverage, however, operators could lose their Oil Spill Financial Responsibility certification and be forced to suspend offshore operations.","(The Center Square) − Dismissal of offshore oil and gas policy litigation contradictory to the Trump administration’s goals are being sought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.

She’s made the request to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

In a letter sent Sept. 24, Murrill said the Department of Justice’s litigation under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has destabilized the insurance market that underpins offshore energy operations and placed Louisiana jobs and production at risk.

“The DOJ filed the lawsuit in question during the waning days of the Biden Administration and have directly harmed the Louisiana energy industry,” Murrill wrote. “The novel position taken by the DOJ is fundamentally contrary to well-settled insurance law and reverses decades of accepted, lawful interpretation and application of insurance policy coverage.”

At the center of the dispute is a lawsuit filed in 2024 that seeks to recover insurance payments related to the 2004 Taylor Energy spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Justice Department says multiple years of insurance coverage may apply to the long-running spill – an interpretation Murrill say upends long-standing industry norms.

According to the letter, the Biden administration’s reinterpretation of the term “incident” under OPA 90 could expose insurers to liability for policies that weren’t even in effect at the time of Hurricane Ivan, the storm that caused the original damage. Murrill warned the move has already prompted insurers to withdraw from the Oil Spill Financial Responsibility market or raise premiums to unsustainable levels.

Murrill emphasized Louisiana’s role as “the epicenter of America’s offshore oil and gas industry,” noting the sector supports more than 100,000 jobs and thousands of small businesses across the state. Production from the gulf has averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day, she said, and could increase with new high-tech projects coming online.

Without adequate insurance coverage, however, operators could lose their Oil Spill Financial Responsibility certification and be forced to suspend offshore operations. Murrill warned such an outcome would “result in job losses in Louisiana, energy market disruptions, and increased liability for the federal government.”

The letter invokes Trump’s January executive order directing federal agencies to encourage exploration and production on federal lands and waters. It also requires the Department of Justice to identify and address court actions inconsistent with the policy.

“Given the direct negative impacts on American energy dominance, we have been optimistic – and presumed – the DOJ would abandon its litigation and dismiss its lawsuits,” she wrote. “Louisiana continues to play a leadership role in driving the country forward with the infrastructure and investments to grow energy production consistent with the vision of President Trump.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/51/351bdf7d-db56-4ca1-99ae-505f247e385e/68d5cd74a892f.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 12:09:38.640808

That includes $1 billion for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which was slated to extend across parts of Washington, Montana and Oregon, Bloomberg first reported. Such hubs are networks of regional hydrogen producers and consumers, plus connective infrastructure like distributors and storage facilities.

The Trump administration’s move was part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s plan to slash $7.56 billion in funding for hundreds of energy projects nationwide. The department has argued that financing them wouldn’t offer sufficient return to taxpayers.

Several other Democrat-leaning states are also seeing climate-related funds terminated, including New York and California.

The news coincides with a White House-imposed pressure campaign for Democratic members of Congress to stop the federal government shutdown. The energy cuts are part of a larger $26 billion funding freeze announced Oct. 1.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a Oct. 2 post on X that the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub “will create a clean hydrogen economy across our region.

“It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,” the Democrat continued. “We’re working with the Attorney General’s Office to fight this illegal action.”

McClatchy has reached out to the DOE and Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub for comment.

The state Office of the Attorney General is “absolutely considering our legal options here,” said spokesperson Mike Faulk. He said the latest news is emblematic of the Trump administration’s disregard for the rule of law.

“It also reflects their economic illiteracy with regard to energy production and unapologetic denial of the robust evidence that shows greenhouse gases are unsustainable for our planet,” Faulk continued. “Abundant renewable energy is key to economic growth as well as environmental protection.” WA Democrats blast Trump over canceled energy funding

U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat, noted in a Oct. 2 news release that the DOE yanked funding for 11 Washington energy and manufacturing projects, including the hydrogen hub.

DelBene slammed the president for going after states that didn’t vote for him.

“President Trump’s campaign of political retribution continues, and hardworking Washingtonians are now part of the collateral damage,” DelBene said. “This politically motivated claw back of funds will result in significant job losses and increased utility bills in our state.”

Russell Vought, chief of the Office of Management and Budget, teased DOE’s nearly $8 billion in cuts in a Oct. 1 post on X. The Trump ally listed states set to lose federal dollars for “Green New Scam” projects — all of which voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

This isn’t the first time that Trump and company have been accused of going after blue states. Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called out the administration in May over its plan to revoke hundreds of millions of dollars in construction-project funding in blue states.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that President Donald Trump has vowed to safeguard taxpayer money and expand the country’s supply of secure, affordable and dependable energy.

“Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Wright continued. “Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The DOE has said it would unravel 321 financial awards bolstering 223 projects.

U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier, a Washington Democrat, called the Trump administration’s decision to gut the $1 billion earmarked for the Pacific Northwest hub “senseless.”

She railed against the move as a “politically motivated attack” on a bipartisan project expected to generate billions of dollars in economy-strengthening investments and create thousands of good-wage jobs.

“At a time when rising prices are already squeezing families across the country, this action hits Washington consumers hard by increasing utility bills and kneecapping U.S. competitiveness in the global energy race,” she said in the Oct. 2 statement.

Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, has also previously praised the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which he said would create high-quality jobs in his state.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom blasted the Trump administration for nixing $1.2 billion meant for the hydrogen hub in California.

“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Newsom said in a statement.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/themes/columbian2/static/img/og/default-2022.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:40.048353

Building US critical mineral resilience | White & Case LLP,Not Available,,,,,https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/shovel-ready-building-us-critical-mineral-resilience,"Additionally, the administration has also designated copper a critical mineral, extending access to policy support.
While EXIM financing has included projects in the critical minerals sector, with environmental statements posted for mining projects, MMIA is not limited to mining.
Additional lending authorities through the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of War have become a vehicle to secure critical minerals value chains.
However, policies supporting critical minerals value chains are largely bipartisan, evidenced by the administration's expansion of financings begun during the Biden administration.
The administration's approach has therefore fused security and geopolitical interests with critical minerals policy domestically, and abroad to secure investment and supply.","In nine months, the Trump administration's policy of energy dominance has reshaped the competitive landscape for the mining & metals sector in the US and beyond. American policy has pivoted from a focus on tax credits for critical minerals projects and preferences built around free trade agreements to a focus on expanding domestic mined and refined supply. Among other things, US government-backed financing aligned to geopolitical priorities is to be used to secure supply in the US and abroad.

While projects can take years, even decades, to move from exploration to production, the administration's supportive approach to the industry shows promise in moving capital toward miners and processors. But partial shutdowns during the US government budget impasse are pushing out the window in which projects can secure permissions and financing. Even if the shutdown is short-lived, mining projects need to plan for a window that may shut within 12 to 24 months, after which renewed political uncertainty could stymie further progress. If a project isn't shovel-ready, miners and processors must get it ready as fast as possible, before this window closes.

The administration's approach can be divided into three buckets. First, the use of administrative interventions such as deregulation, accelerated permitting processes and the executive authority invested in the National Energy Dominance Council to direct all-of-government efforts to accelerate project development; second, the use of existing funding authorities and offtake powers delegated to the Department of Defense and other federal bodies to finance and support projects deemed critical to national security; and third, the application of tariffs and negotiation of investment agreements linked to geopolitical and diplomatic initiatives, namely the critical minerals investment agreement with the Ukrainian government, a peace deal between the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, a memorandum of cooperation regarding critical minerals with Saudi Arabia, and an agreement to co-invest into critical minerals value chains with the UAE.

Taken together, the current policy mix is a more supportive environment for investment into the mining & metals value chain in the US or in partnership with US allies elsewhere. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is supportive in the near-term, allowing companies building manufacturing projects before 2029 to deduct 100 percent of the eligible property's cost in its first year of operations as long as it's in service before January 1, 2031. On paper, this should support greenfield processing, refining and smelting projects in the US. However, potential constraints on labor, a more inflationary economic environment, and uncertainty over investment, the cost of capital and economic growth may challenge projects, especially those dependent on private sector demand instead of publicly backed offtake support.

Racing for critical mineral dominance

Seeking to onshore the extraction and/or processing of those critical minerals vital to national security, manufacturing and tech giants undertaking huge AI-driven investment into datacenters and associated utilities, the administration has launched a dramatic reform effort to accelerate permitting. Begun with the Unleashing American Energy executive order (EO) on January 20, 2025 and continued with additional EOs since, the administration's highest priority has been reducing the immensely long, arduous lead times to receive permission to build mines. Additionally, the administration has also designated copper a critical mineral, extending access to policy support.

The National Energy Dominance Council formed in February 2025, a cabinet-level coordinating body chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, is explicitly tasked with improving permitting and accelerating projects deemed vital for national security. Acting on its mandate, the Council's deliberations and parallel action from the White House rescinded existing regulatory burdens imposed by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) on June 30, 2025. The EO delegates more authority to each department to narrowly apply the law for NEPA reviews, impose review page limits, and eases the process of establishing exclusions from the review process. These regulatory rollbacks potentially come at the expense of environmental outcomes, a legitimate cause for concern that poses legal risks after the Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron Deference doctrine.

Existing projects stuck in limbo have benefited from designation under FAST-41, a federal designation for projects to accelerate decisions on outstanding permit applications. The largest project among them—the Rio Tinto–led Resolution Copper in Arizona—received an expedited environmental impact statement and decision from the US Forest Service in June. Resolution Copper could provide up to 400,000 tons of copper production, equivalent to approximately 25 percent of US demand and enough to significantly reduce dependence on refined copper imports as smelting and refining capacity comes online. Resolution Copper still faces a legal injunction on a necessary land swap to build the mine, but the federal government continues to support a faster development timeline.

Please see the list of the FAST-41 Transparency Projects here.

With or without FAST-41 status, copper, rare earths, uranium and gold projects are the likeliest to benefit most in the near term. Persistent fears of large copper concentrates deficits after 2030 dovetail with greater demand growth linked to electrification. China's export controls on light and heavy rare earths have left defense and automotive manufacturers exposed to supply chain concentration. A significant expansion of domestic uranium mining and processing similarly would support the administration's efforts to kickstart a nuclear power renaissance.

Designation for faster review doesn't guarantee success. The administration is blocking the development of Northern Dynasty's Pebble Mine project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of the world's largest undeveloped gold and copper prospects, fearing environmental impacts on the Bay's salmon fisheries. As officials begin reviewing projects with significant environmental impacts—Orla Mining's Dark Star Mine near Elko, Nevada is the first open-pit mine receiving an accelerated review—market participants will learn more about the relative importance assigned to local concerns.

Despite some uncertainty about degree, there is a definitive change and expansion of what's considered a permissible tradeoff between development, environmental concerns and national needs. Newfound support for research, exploration and international leadership for offshore deep sea mining projects highlights this shift, though the lack of an established regulatory framework remains troublesome.

Show me the money

Alongside aggressive coordination efforts fast-tracking permissions, policymakers are expanding support for strategically important projects. The Department of Energy's loan program office is having its remit expanded to include traditional fossil fuel infrastructure, while backing away from its past mandate to lend to projects aiding emissions reduction like battery gigafactories requiring lithium and other metals offtakes. Make More in America (MMIA) supports a broad range of U.S. manufacturing and production projects that strengthen American competitiveness. While EXIM financing has included projects in the critical minerals sector, with environmental statements posted for mining projects, MMIA is not limited to mining. It is important to note that MMIA applies only to domestic U.S. projects. Separately, EXIM provides international export financing through its traditional programs under a distinct statutory framework. Additional lending authorities through the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of War have become a vehicle to secure critical minerals value chains.

The concentration of rare earths mining and refining in China poses significant national security risks exposed by China's implementation of export license controls on a widening array of rare earths and battery metals since 2023. In the spring, western OEMs and defense manufacturers panicked over any sudden halt to trade flows from a lack of large inventories. But breaking into the mining and processing of rare earths has been notoriously difficult because of the low price points at which Chinese producers can operate and their advantages from existing economies of scale.

By considering equity stakes and supporting profitability through price interventions, the administration is prioritizing onshoring production of key inputs, particularly for existing brownfield assets. Current policy also aims to leverage the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).

By taking on equity and guaranteeing profitability through price interventions, the administration is prioritizing onshoring production of key inputs where possible with greater influence over investment decisions. Taking equity positions in exchange for financial support has become a vote of confidence for investors and an implicit promise of support when market conditions deteriorate. DFC has in place commitments to support the Lobito Corridor, a rail route linking the Angolan port to the Copperbelt in the DRC and Zambia. In September, the agency announced a US$75 million equity commitment to seed the US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that will provide seed capital to jumpstart the fund's investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons and related infrastructure in Ukraine. Other initiatives to combine the DFC's efforts with private funding, in some cases, and sovereign wealth, in others, may be explored with a particular focus on investments in critical minerals. A significant increase in the DFC's investment capacity is also under consideration in a congressional reauthorization hoping to take place in November 2025. But with many staff of both DFC and EXIM currently furloughed and both looking for congressional reauthorization in the coming months, a speedy resolution to the budget impasse may be critical for them to maintain momentum to finance mining projects during the window described above.

Carrots and sticks

Trade policy has expanded into an instrument organizing industrial policy through a broad array of carrots and sticks. Since 2018, tariffs have been featured as a tool to protect domestic steel and aluminum production under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The Trump administration expanded the use of Section 232 in 2025, increasing the steel tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent, and the aluminum tariffs from 10 percent to 50 percent. On August 1, 2025, 50 percent of Section 232 tariffs were also levied on imports of semi-refined copper products, a move meant to foster more investment into domestic smelting and refining. Officials are still considering a 15 to 30 percent general copper import tariff for 2027 that will be reviewed next year. A similar investigation is ongoing for a broad range of processed critical minerals and derivative products, including rare earths and uranium, with a report and policy recommendations scheduled for delivery to the President in October.

Each shift in the tariff regime alters domestic project economics—higher import costs can offset higher construction, labor and operational costs for US projects. But their application by executive order also creates the potential for negotiated exemptions with foreign partners in line with diplomatic and geopolitical initiatives. Conversely, the Republican majorities in Congress's unwillingness so far to challenge the Trump administration's tariffs in regulating trade or establishing these priorities beyond budget allocations can create longer-term risks from shifts in policy. However, policies supporting critical minerals value chains are largely bipartisan, evidenced by the administration's expansion of financings begun during the Biden administration.

Two major diplomatic initiatives have produced intergovernmental framework agreements for mining and metals projects—attempts to broker peace and post-war stability in Ukraine and the DRC. Responding to Ukrainian concerns that the US might disengage from military and security support, the US government negotiated the creation of a joint fund for exploration and early-stage development. All projects' equity will be split between the two governments. Since much of Ukraine's critical mineral wealth currently sits in occupied territory, the agreement provides a longer-term basis for US involvement.

More pressing for metals markets, the Trump administration brokered the Washington Accord between the governments of the DRC and Rwanda, which risked threatening mining operations. While the agreement only begins implementation in October, and did not include M23, which continues to fight against the Congolese government in Kinshasa, the DFC has begun underwriting exploration agreements in the region. To date, there is no systematic process for US firms to invest, and a durable peace deal has yet to be reached.

Finally, the administration has brokered a memorandum of cooperation with the Saudi government to collaborate securing critical minerals and an agreement with the UAE to co-invest into relevant projects. These agreements build on both countries' existing critical minerals strategies acquiring strategic stakes in mining businesses and projects internationally. The administration's approach has therefore fused security and geopolitical interests with critical minerals policy domestically, and abroad to secure investment and supply. These efforts can also create headwinds for US firms and opportunities for miners based in Europe. Tensions between the governments of Greenland and Denmark with Washington over talk of incorporating Greenland into the United States opened the door to more agreements with European companies. The unintended consequences of transactional minerals diplomacy can create opportunities in Europe and elsewhere too.

Macro-economic road bumps

Miners and investors attempting to capitalize on these shifts in policy face demand uncertainty and structural constraints that will likely elevate project costs. The repeal of most tax credit provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act in the OBBB creates a headwind for the uptake of electric vehicles on the US market. Coupled with the slowdown in federal permissions for clean energy and battery storage, the demand outlook for domestic lithium projects faces uncertainty. Among the major US automakers, Ford is the only company committing to aggressive EV production targets and investment timelines.

More broadly, current policies create risks of significant increases in the cost base for projects. A more restrictive immigration policy has begun to pose a challenge for the construction sector. Projects requiring significant infrastructure investment and development will likely cost more as a result. But labor shortages are most pronounced for more senior expertise because new mines haven't been developed at scale in the US for a generation. Tariffs and the lack of a large domestic industrial base for mining & metals kits pose additional cost pressures. In the years ahead, electricity will also become a cost pressure point driven by rapidly growing demands on power grids, for AI data centers, and balancing supply between baseload, renewables and batteries.

Finally, greater uncertainty about future economic growth may challenge the economics of some proposed mines. For instance, copper prices and demand correlate strongly to GDP growth, a relationship strengthening from electrification. But the present policy mix creates headwinds for growth, even as it encourages domestic investment into mining & metals. By contrast, the demand for gold often correlates to uncertainty, inflation and the value of the US dollar, which has depreciated against other major currencies at near historic levels for the past 50 years.

These challenges will not stop investment into the sector, nor will they necessarily last. Miners like Ivanhoe Electric, which concluded its preliminary feasibility study for the Santa Cruz copper project in Arizona in June, can lock in the benefit of more accommodative policy. But the current policy environment creates a market landscape with two tiers. Miners chiefly serving private sector demand and making use of expedited permitting alone face greater risks than miners receiving financial support from the US government. Both groups enjoy an accommodative policy environment, but the latter also enjoys financial support that may be unavailable in commercial markets.

A credible solution to plastic waste?
“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community.
Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed.","The plan sounded like a magic bullet from the future to solve one of the world’s most vexing environmental waste problems.

In Rohnert Park, just north of San Francisco, a startup company called Resynergi planned to use a form of “advanced recycling” to reuse plastic. Its process would chemically transform old plastic, blasting bits of it with microwaves until they turned into an oil that could then be used to make new plastic.

But the process – known as pyrolysis – was a hard sell to Sonoma County neighbors, who protested so much that the company withdrew its application and now plans to move out of state.

The fight that boiled over in Rohnert Park in recent months is a window into the tensions ahead for California as the state overhauls nation-leading regulations governing plastic pollution and packaging. (CalRecycle, formally known as the Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling, will hold a public hearing about those rules Oct. 7.)

While California is establishing some of the most forward-thinking plastic responsibility and recycling rules in the country, a dirty secret is that most plastic recycling methods are ineffective at best and illusory at worst.

Millions of tons of plastic go to the state’s landfills each year, and millions more are shipped to Southeast Asia, where plastic is rarely recycled. Instead it is illegally dumped, and often burned.

Last year, Attorney General Rob Bonta brought suit against ExxonMobil for “perpetuating the myth … that you can recycle plastics, including single use plastics, and that it’s sustainable and good for the environment … It’s not true. It’s a lie.” ExxonMobil has since countersued Bonta for defamation.

California’s regulators, meanwhile, are working to implement a 2022 state law that moves the state toward a circular economy for plastic – by making companies that produce packaging and single-use plastic items responsible for what happens to them after people throw them away. Those companies, along with environmental groups, have been weighing in as CalRecycle has been writing regulations, now years in the making.

Recent comments by Gov. Gavin Newsom suggest the state is aiming to strike a balance, finding a way to encourage recycling companies while hitting the state’s goals – all while avoiding more air pollution or other environmental impacts.

As for Resynergi, local and environmental advocates say that the way local, county, and regional regulators handled the company points up the challenges the state will face as it regulates plastic and defines whether and how it can be recycled.

“It does make me nervous, since it took seven years to get any enforcement on a facility that’s a two hour drive from the Capitol,” said Nick Lapis, advocacy director for Californians Against Waste.

A credible solution to plastic waste?

Resynergi’s departure came as Sonoma County officials began to ask more serious questions about its operations, almost a decade after the company first arrived.

In 2017, company founder Brian Bauer chose Rohnert Park, a small, middle-class community surrounded by farmland, to develop and test his process.

He set up shop in a development called SOMO Village – a 200-acre neighborhood with homes, a high school, and commercial space. Developers market it as a climate-conscious place, built to be carbon-neutral, which Bauer said was a draw for Resynergi.

In early conversations, according to Bauer, Sonoma County officials “suggested” his business could follow simpler recycling guidelines. Sheri Cardo, a spokesperson for Sonoma County’s Department of Health Services, confirmed the department had talked with Bauer about its operations as a recycling research and development site, and that his characterization was accurate.

In 2023, when Bauer sought to expand operations, he approached the city of Rohnert Park’s planning division for permits.

Officials told Bauer his facility was considered a heavy manufacturing site, and that Resynergi’s location – 600 feet from a school – demanded an environmental review, according to documents obtained by residents through a public records request. In a response late last year, Resynergi argued that such a review could take too long, and moving quickly “could make or break substantial investment from a large strategic investor.”

Within a month, planning officials had flipped and were now siding with Resynergi, granting it a more flexible, less burdensome administrative use permit. The decision avoided additional public review.

But to operate legally, Resynergi had to secure approval from county officials and the regional air district.

In California, pyrolysis is classified as a type of incineration, associated with toxic and hazardous waste. Businesses must obtain a solid waste permit from local authorities, who enforce the state’s public resources code. In the past, three facilities have received permits to use pyrolysis, two for the purpose of destroying medical waste. All are now closed, according to CalRecycle.

California counties issue waste permits on behalf of CalRecycle. The Bay Area Regional Air Quality Management District permits and controls pollution that microwaving plastic could produce.

County officials started looking into the company when they realized Resynergi’s plans would make the company a fully operational and “fixed component in the county’s waste system,” said Cardo, the county spokesperson.

“Although your facility might be considered a recycling facility in vernacular language, it is not under state law,” wrote Christine Sosko, Sonoma County’s director of environmental health.

CalRecycle spokesman Lance Klug said in an email that Sonoma County’s response followed state standards.

But environmental advocates say the way city and county officials handled Resynergi reflects regulators’ confusion about the processes for advanced recycling – confusion fueled by the plastic industry.

Jane Williams, director of California Communities Against Toxics, argues that federal and state law make it clear that pyrolysis facilities have to follow rules as incinerators. “It’s really interesting for me to see, having worked on these incinerators for so long, how these guys pulled strings,” Williams said. “They pulled whatever out of their pockets so they could convince people this is a recycling facility.”

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group supporting the plastic industry, disagrees. And Resynergi’s Bauer said he doesn’t think his company’s process counts as incineration.

“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community. “This city has the chance to lead by example.”

Community fears toxic air pollution

People living in and near SOMO Village found out that Resynergi planned to burn plastic on a larger scale when the Bay Area Air Quality Management District notified the public of the company’s permit application.

The community protested, filling city council rooms at each meeting and waving signs depicting polluting smoke stacks. Some parents spoke through tears to their city leaders. “Our air is not your experiment,” one poster read.

Among the local opponents of Resynergi was Stephanie Lennox. She lives about 20 minutes from Rohnert Park in rural Forestville, but her two daughters go to Credo High School right next to the facility. She wondered about emissions and the risk of an explosion.

“My Lord, don’t we need a solution to our global plastic pollution,” Lennox said. “But my daughters’ lungs are not part of your beta testing phase for your ‘world’s global plastic solution.’”

Local organizers said they wanted city and county leaders to follow state law and the federal Clean Air Act.

When plastic is burned, additives like flame retardants or other chemicals that don’t break down can create toxic emissions, said Veena Singla, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco.

Resynergi applied to the regional air district to obtain a permit for pollution control equipment in April, after the company had already begun operating their technology.

In August, the air district issued three notices of violation to Resynergi for constructing and operating without a permit.

Bauer admitted to operating the equipment without a permit. The company never burned plastic in Rohnert Park he said; it did burn plastic at “prototype levels” in Santa Rosa.

But, Bauer added, Resynergi was trying to follow the rules as he understood them. As a startup, he said, “you don’t even know if you will get a prototype to work. You’re also trying to figure out how the permitting process works.”

Millions spent to sway regulations

Resynergi’s departure wasn’t because of a community outcry, Bauer said. The turning point, he said, was “the pull from other states; how they treated climate technologies such as ours …combined with the overall culture of accepting what we’re doing.”

Plastics manufacturers and industry advocates like the American Chemistry Council have campaigned to redefine terms and loosen environmental regulations for the process Resynergi is developing. After the lobbying, 27 states have reclassified pyrolysis as manufacturing instead of solid waste operations, said Davis Allen, a researcher for the Center for Climate Integrity. That classification helps operators get around federal air requirements, he added.

Resynergi’s Bauer told CalMatters that “one of those (states) is a candidate,” and that the company will move out by the end of the year.

An analysis by the climate accountability newsletter HEATED found the chemistry council and groups aligned with it have spent as much as $30 million to promote the concept of advanced recycling as a mainstream and established one. That language aims to sway not just state laws, but federal clean air policy as well.

Between 2021 and 2022, when lawmakers were discussing plastic producer legislation, the American Chemistry Council spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying state legislators, according to publicly available data published by the Secretary of State.

The American Chemistry Council’s Ross Eisenberg says that pyrolysis and other chemical recycling processes do work. These processes turn “hard-to-recycle plastics into the raw materials for high-quality products while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and fossil energy use during production compared with virgin production,” he said.

“America’s plastic makers are investing billions of dollars to modernize and expand recycling capacity and improve efficiency,” Eisenberg said, adding that the companies are “advocating for smart policies that enhance collection and sorting so more plastics can be remade into new products.”

This year, the Environmental Protection Agency said it isn’t taking further action on the matter, but industry representatives said they’ll continue to lobby at the federal level.

Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic

California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed. Within seven years, state law seeks to reduce plastic packaging by 25%, make single-use plastic packaging 100% recyclable or compostable, and divert most of that packaging into recycling.

Allen, from the Center for Climate Integrity, says laws like this can be a good idea – as long as regulators focus more on reducing plastics and less on recycling them.

“Almost any solution that is based on the idea that plastics can widely be recycled just isn’t really going to work,” Allen said. “There just aren’t easily available solutions to a lot of the problems that limit the effectiveness of recycling.”

But in March, regulations aimed at achieving the state’s goals were dealt a setback after two years of hearings. The day they were due, Gov. Newsom directed CalRecycle to start the regulatory process over.

The governor asked for changes “to minimize costs for small businesses and families – while ensuring California’s bold recycling law can achieve the critical goal of cutting plastic pollution,” said Daniel Villaseñor, a spokesperson for the governor, in an email to CalMatters.

The Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council hailed the governor’s announcement as an opportunity. “We believe California’s regulations should be clear, technology-neutral, and performance-based,” said the council’s Ross Eisenberg.

According to Klug, the CalRecycle spokesman, the state “remains committed to fostering business innovation that promotes a safe and clean future for all Californians.”

But environmental organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Surfrider called the decision disappointing.

Williams, the California Communities Against Toxics activist, said she’s concerned that more recent draft language may encourage pyrolysis facilities like Resynergi, which, she says, don’t belong in the state.

If California “rolls out the red carpet,” she said, “The only thing that will stop a whole new fleet of incinerators being built in California now is open, persistent community opposition.”

Resynergi also took part in CalRecycle workshops for the regulations. The company’s departure announcement praised the “innovative spirit of California … instrumental in the company’s growth.”

Brian Bauer said he’s hopeful the state plastic regulations will ease regulations for companies like his, but he plans to return to California either way.

“So it might be a couple years,” Bauer said. “We’ll be back to California in due time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082725_Rohnert-Park-Incinerator_CS_CM_06.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:20.154567

From pioneering clean energy to scaling up advanced manufacturing and digital innovation, we’re backing the sectors that will define the future. This strategy is about delivery, not just ambition — and it’s already laying the foundations for a stronger, more resilient economy that works for everyone.

Advanced Manufacturing

The newly launched DRIVE35 programme is injecting £2.5 billion into the automotive sector, supporting capital investment and R&D. A £650 million electric vehicle grant scheme is already accelerating consumer adoption, while over 50 cutting-edge auto projects have secured £70 million in innovation funding.

Clean Energy Industries

The UK’s clean energy ambitions are advancing at pace. The Contracts for Difference Allocation Round 7 has opened with a £544 million budget, while ten hydrogen projects from Allocation Round 1 are now moving forward — creating over 700 jobs. Two new Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) projects will join the HyNet cluster, supporting nearly 3,000 jobs across North Wales and the North West.

Creative Industries

The government is investing in the UK’s world-class creative industries, with £150 million from the Creative Places Growth Fund allocated to regions including the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. New higher technical qualifications and a Creative Careers Programme are being developed to inspire the next generation of talent.

Defence

An £182 million Defence Skills package will establish five new Defence Technical Excellence Colleges, while £220 million is being invested in test and evaluation capabilities through the Defence Tech Scaler. A further £65 million is supporting SMEs and exporters in the defence sector.

At the same time, legislation known as the Green New Deal was gaining popularity among progressives and climate activists. The Green New Deal legislation put forward a top-down, public-sector approach to addressing climate change. While the exact parameters of the Green New Deal were vague, it emphasized massive-scale federal investment in climate-related infrastructure projects, invoking FDR’s New Deal. The climate activists downplayed or even dismissed carbon taxes—fees on greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel use and other economic activity—as both regressive and inadequate to achieving their goals.

While the Green New Deal was not a serious legislative proposal, the Biden administration’s approach to addressing climate change was closer to the Green New Deal approach than it was to carbon pricing. The resulting Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) relied heavily on subsidies for green technologies, whether zero-emission electricity generation or electric vehicles. The Biden administration also pursued emissions reduction through regulation.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2025, cut the IRA green energy subsidies substantially, although it stopped short of full repeal. With the IRA subsidies gutted and deficits elevated, carbon taxes may be worth another look.

The case for carbon taxes.

A tax on socially harmful behavior is known as a Pigouvian tax, named for the British economist Arthur Pigou, who introduced the concept in 1920. The basic case for such a tax is that some economic activity imposes costs on third parties not involved in those transactions. Those costs are also known as externalities. A Pigouvian tax forces economic actors to factor in these social costs. Taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are the two most prominent historical examples of Pigouvian taxes. The idea is to find the social cost of an activity, such as the climate impacts of carbon emissions, and impose a tax at the rate that aligns the costs from producing emissions with the benefits.

The straightforward advantage of this policy in the context of climate change is that it leaves the decision of which emissions to reduce, and by how much, to the market. It may be cheap to reduce emissions in some sectors, but expensive in others. Under a broad carbon price, firms would undertake the least expensive approaches possible to reducing emissions. Depending on the context, that might mean more incremental changes, like improvements in energy efficiency or replacing coal-fired electricity generation with natural gas, or it might mean more radical decarbonization involving the full-scale adoption of zero-emission technology in electricity generation, passenger cars, or even other more difficult areas like industrial processes.

The U.S. has not implemented a significant carbon tax at the national level. Carbon taxes have been introduced in plenty of other developed countries, such as Sweden, Norway, France, and the United Kingdom. Carbon taxes (and cap-and-trade systems, which are similar) have expanded around the world in the past two decades. The most notable setback came in Canada this year, when new Prime Minister Mark Carney repealed the federal carbon tax that had been a signature achievement of Justin Trudeau’s premiership.

Critiques of carbon pricing.

Critiques of the simple “Econ 101” case for a carbon tax abound. They’re worth addressing, but none of them defeat the underlying logic of the basic approach.

1. The social cost of carbon is a flawed metric.

To get to the social cost of carbon, you need to first model the damage from carbon emissions, a difficult process in itself. But then you must choose a discount rate (in short, how much to value future costs relative to present costs), and whether to consider the global costs of emissions or just the domestic costs.

Reasonable assumptions about discount rates and global versus domestic costs can produce wildly different estimates of the social cost of carbon, from under $10 to almost $200. Because methodological differences produce dramatically different estimates of the social cost of carbon,

just about any carbon tax policy could plausibly be argued to either overprice or underprice emissions. However, this issue is not exclusive to carbon pricing. When considering a regulation on power plant emissions or the size of subsidies for green energy investment, policymakers also must make judgment calls on how to value potential future costs of climate change.

There is no objectively correct, scientific answer to how much we should worry about climate change. However, given that we will implement climate policy in some form, and given that carbon emissions do have a social cost, a carbon tax is still the best option in the toolkit. In simple terms, we have agreed on the premise; now we’re just negotiating the price.

2. Carbon taxes distract from pro-innovation policy that will lower the cost of green energy.

Carbon taxes should drive clean energy innovation, and that is especially true in the United States. The pattern of “induced innovation,” where energy innovation accelerates when energy prices are higher, suggests a carbon tax would spur innovation in lower-emission technology. That’s truer in the U.S. because we are a massive market. A carbon tax in, say, Luxembourg probably won't drive emissions reduction through technological innovation because Luxembourg is not a big market for innovators to pursue. The United States is.

A carbon tax and government support for new technological development are not mutually exclusive. Even with a carbon tax, there is a case for government support for energy research, just like there is a role for government support for basic research in other fields.

The challenges to broader technological transformation apply regardless of a carbon price or innovation subsidy approach. If the main constraint to more transformative decarbonization is, say, permitting, then that is going to be a challenge whether the primary financial lever for supporting clean energy investments is a tax subsidy for new technology or a tax on carbon emissions.

3. Carbon taxes don’t go far enough.

A carbon price is not the same as a net-zero-emissions policy, and that's a good thing. Fossil fuels are tremendously useful technologies, even if they have downsides. A carbon tax would make private actors take the environmental costs of burning fossil fuels into consideration, but in many cases no viable alternatives to fossil fuels exist (and there may not be for a long time). A carbon tax lets market actors—you and me—decide if certain activities are worth their environmental costs.

4. Carbon taxes disproportionately burden low-income households.

While there is some truth to this critique, the same can be said of other climate policies too. Green energy credits, whether consumer-facing ones for electric vehicles or business-side ones for electricity generation or other green energy tech, disproportionately flow to high-income households and big businesses and must ultimately be offset by other sources of tax revenue or spending cuts.

The economic burden of command-and-control regulation of fuel use also falls disproportionately on low-income households. Most of the economic literature shows carbon taxes are less regressive than these alternatives.

The other factor to consider here: Carbon taxes produce revenue. Converting all, or even some, of the carbon tax revenue to universal flat cash transfer payments could more than offset the economic burden of the tax for lower- and middle-income households.

The big picture.

In implementing a carbon tax, an additional consideration is the need for deficit reduction. Revenue will have to be part of the conversation. In a situation where policymakers are looking to bring deficits down, a climate policy approach like a carbon tax that reduces the deficit has a lot more appeal than an approach like green subsidies that increases it.

Carbon taxes justifiably have their critics; translating the simple model of a Pigouvian tax to climate change involves a lot of judgment calls worthy of debate. Nonetheless, most of the objections to a carbon tax as a policy mechanism apply to other climate policies too, and the core structural advantages of a carbon tax still hold relative to the alternatives.",https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-528822404.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:02.721699

The US Environmental Protection Agency is under fire for cancelling a USD 7 billion solar-power programme...

The US Environmental Protection Agency is under fire for cancelling a USD 7 billion solar-power programme despite already guaranteeing that funds would be forthcoming.

A coalition of trades unions, environmental campaigners, businesses and individual homeowners has filed a lawsuit in the District of Rhode Island against the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its administrator Lee Zeldin, challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the USD 7 billion ‘Solar for All’ programme. The complaint, lodged yesterday (6 October), argues that the EPA acted unlawfully in cancelling a scheme designed to bring solar power to more than 900,000 low-income households nationwide. The claimants contend that Congress had already guaranteed the funds, meaning they were legally preserved even after lawmakers repealed parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund earlier this year.

The case is being brought by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO (a federation of trades unions), the Rhode Island Center for Justice, Solar United Neighbors, Sunpath Consulting, 2KB Energy Services, Energy Independent Solutions, Black Sun Light Sustainability and individual homeowner Anh Nguyen of Atlanta, Georgia.

The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the US Constitution, particularly the separation of powers. Claimants argue that by rescinding funds that Congress had already obligated, the executive branch unlawfully usurped Congress’s “power of the purse”.

HUGE MISTAKE

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All. This popular programme was poised to bring more solar to our communities, provide jobs for the small businesses installing those projects, and help families get cheap, clean power,” said Nick Torrey, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center, in an online statement. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

The 47-page filing emphasises the scale of reliance on the programme. Rhode Island AFL-CIO had invested heavily in apprenticeship and workforce planning, anticipating hundreds of new union jobs. The Rhode Island Center for Justice expanded staff and entered formal agreements with state agencies to deliver affordable solar power to disadvantaged households. Solar United Neighbors hired staff in Florida, Texas and Indiana and had already begun projects such as ‘Hub Homes’ in Harris County, designed to provide backup power to communities during blackouts.

BUSINESSES’ DIRECT LOSSES

Georgia-based Sunpath Solar reported more than USD 30,000 in out-of-pocket costs for vehicles, USD 18,000 in annual software expenses and more than USD 100,000 in staff commitments tied to Solar for All contracts. 2KB Energy Services, also in Georgia, estimated nearly USD 2 million in lost revenue over the contract period and said it had been forced to lay off staff after purchasing compliance tools and project software specifically for the scheme. Black Sun Light Sustainability lost a USD 29.9 million sub-award in Indiana that was to fund five energy cooperatives, 50 resilience hubs and 200 rooftop projects.

MAKING AMERICANS PAY

Environmental groups have not held back in their criticism of the programme’s termination. “EPA’s termination […] is a betrayal against a million American families and communities who need access to clean, affordable energy,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government. “By terminating the Solar for All programme while simultaneously ending clean air protections, this administration is sending a clear message: they will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry. We will not allow this administration to trample the legal rights of Americans, and we will keep fighting for a clean, affordable future for the people and the planet.”

Amy Romero, chief legal counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, added: “Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy. EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this programme.”

The legal arguments rest heavily on statutory interpretation. Claimants point to the July 2025 legislation, which repealed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and rescinded only “unobligated balances”. By September 2024, the EPA had already awarded and allocated the full USD 7 billion, and the claimants argue that the repeal could not retroactively extinguish those grants.

BOONDOGGLE

Administrator Zeldin has defended the decision, writing on social media that the “EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle [or wasteful project] alive”. The EPA subsequently issued termination letters to grantees on 7 August, claiming that without statutory authorisation and administrative appropriations, it could not lawfully continue the scheme.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement: “The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All programme is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families. This programme would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat. Stripping those benefits away is unlawful and betrays communities. We will not let it stand.”",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/coalition-sues-epa-over-termination-of-solar-for-all-plan_0_QEQo8ZxbOn5sKlxTLPjHAbdg8pL30IuL4nAnEXd3.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:06.448375

Delta will use $268,248 from the N.C. Division of Air Quality to buy six electric belt loaders used to get luggage on and off planes at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The airline plans to retire six diesel belt loaders, leaving it with about a dozen diesels still in use at RDU, according to the airline.

Each year, the state awards grants to reduce pollution from diesel-powered “mobile sources,” including trucks, buses, lawnmowers and construction equipment. The money comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program, created by Congress in 2005.

Altogether, the state awarded $1.14 million in grants this year. Other recipients include the town of Carrboro, which received $6,951 to replace a utility terrain vehicle with an electric model.

With each grant award, the Division of Air Quality lists the estimated amount of pollution it will prevent. In the case of Delta’s belt loaders, the state estimates emissions reductions over the liftime of the machines of 1,316 tons of carbon dioxide, 3.36 tons of nitrogen oxides and 560 pounds of small particulates.

Delta has bought more than 2,000 electric belt loaders, bag tractors and other ground equipment across its network since 2020, according to Jesse Miers, Delta’s director of fleet operations. About 39% of core ground support equipment is now electric, Miers said.

The transition to electric will help the company achieve its goal of producing net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Miers said. The state grant helps accelerate that process at RDU, he said.

Last year, the company received $132,420 from the same grant program to help replace four pieces of diesel equipment at RDU with electric ones.

A turn-the-other-cheek Christian candidate would appear too weak or out of touch to lead a party or a nation.
From memory, Talarico quoted Catholic Worker Movement co-founder Dorothy Day: ""You really only love God as much as you love the person you love the least.""","Religion and politics dramatically intertwined when thousands of people attended Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's memorial service on Sept. 21. The loud gathering exemplified the rise of Christian nationalism within the Republican Party — and the call to a quasi-spiritual, quasi-political battle between good and evil.

In contrast, more quietly, days earlier, a 36-year-old Democrat studying to be a Presbyterian minister launched a bid for the U.S. Senate in Texas. State Rep. James Talarico's announcement was substantially different from the Kirk memorial's apocalyptic message.

""My granddad was a Baptist preacher in South Texas,"" he said. ""He taught me that we follow a barefoot rabbi who gave two commandments: love God and love neighbor. Because there is no love of God without love of neighbor.""

Talarico's speech, delivered while standing on a flatbed truck in front of a church, is inspiring, profound and unique for a Democrat. His message has the potential to transcend party lines — and perhaps even transform American politics. This three-minute clip offers one of the clearest, compelling examples in decades of a public official linking hopeful Christianity to our national public discourse.

Unlike Talarico, many Democratic candidates dodge the topic of religion in politics, while Republicans have embraced the religious right, politically benefitting from the modern reality that ""all politics is influenced by identity [including religion],"" as Ezra Klein writes in his excellent book, Why We're Polarized.

For decades, I worked in government and politics at all levels, including senior positions in three Democratic presidential campaigns. I've seen candidates and the party struggle to connect with religious voters, fearing that ""God talk"" only benefits Republicans and stirs culture war issues.

Talarico masterfully accepts this challenge and isn't shy about sharing Christian teaching as a unifying message. ""Every single person bears the image of the sacred,"" he said. ""Every single person is holy, not just my neighbors who look like me, or pray like me, or vote like me.""

But equally significant, Talarico understands that we live in combative times. A turn-the-other-cheek Christian candidate would appear too weak or out of touch to lead a party or a nation. But this candidate emphasizes how Jesus was not just a revolutionary figure but a true rebel in his time.

""Two thousand years ago, when the powerful few rigged the system, that barefoot rabbi walked into the seat of power and flipped over the tables of injustice,"" said Talarico. ""To those who love this state, to those who love this country, to those who love our neighbors, it's time to start flipping tables.""

And he is straightforward about what he means. His campaign video starts with a declaration: ""The biggest divide in our country is not left versus right, it's top versus bottom."" Billionaires, Talarico goes on to say, want people to look left and right at each other, ""so that we're not looking up at them.""

His understanding of justice and moral courage provides a lens through which he approaches real-world politics, shaping the decisions that have defined his short but impressive political career. Talarico is a relative newcomer to politics. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2018 and recently entered the U.S. Senate Democratic primary against a better-known candidate.

He attracted national attention earlier this year by leading the debate against a bill that required Texas public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Talarico argued that the bill was not only unconstitutional and un-American but also ""deeply un-Christian."" He pointed out that the bill imposed one religious tradition over others, violating the principle of religious freedom. The bill eventually passed, but Talarico's calm, thoughtful arguments impressed people on both sides of the aisle, leading to some notable media attention.

In July, his message found a national platform on the popular Joe Rogan podcast. During that two-and-a-half-hour conversation, which has received over 1 million views so far, Talarico impressively discussed a wide range of political, religious and historical issues.

Talarico said that ""this idea that there is a set Christian orthodoxy on the issue of abortion is just not rooted in Scripture."" But he welcomed ""honest debate."" He said that if Pope Francis were to come back to life and express his pro-life, anti-abortion stance, Talarico would listen to and respect the pope's theological argument. Ultimately, Talarico said that he wanted pro-choice Christians who respect women's bodily autonomy to be given the space to make their theological arguments.

From memory, Talarico quoted Catholic Worker Movement co-founder Dorothy Day: ""You really only love God as much as you love the person you love the least."" Rogan told Talarico that he's the type of good person who should be in public office — and concluded that the Texan should run for president.

The Rogan conversation revealed Talarico's intellectual range. Then, in August, his appearance on Chris Cuomo's podcast clarified his political philosophy more precisely.

Talarico described himself as theologically conservative and politically progressive. ""That's the long-term bet I'm making,"" he said. ""That love and compassion are going to win in the long run."" Cuomo likened Talarico to his late father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the last nationally prominent Catholic to openly discuss how religious faith influences public service.

Talarico's approach demonstrates that faith can drive politics without weaponizing it — a model that feels both urgent and overdue in our current moment. His vision stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric on display at Charlie Kirk's memorial service, where President Donald Trump declared: ""I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them.""

Where Trump and the Christian nationalist movement frame politics as spiritual warfare, demanding the defeat of enemies, Talarico invites Americans into a Christian tradition that sees the sacred in every person and justice as an expression of love.

Whether his Senate bid succeeds or not, his message represents the potential for transformative realignment. He's showing Democrats how to reclaim a moral vocabulary without compromising pluralism.

And he's reminding Christians that our tradition offers a pathway for healing rather than deepening our national divisions.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-10/Election_2026_Texas_Senate_Redistricting_25228782289806.jpg?h=8b9c984c&itok=CZrsXNxG,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:55.935669

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

Additional Topics on Which EPA Seeks Comment:

Data about which refrigerants are being considered or adopted in new refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses;

Data about the commercial availability and timeline for adoption of new refrigeration equipment using lower-GWP substitutes in remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses, as it relates to the proposed 2032 compliance dates for these subsectors;

The company also stated that the consummation of the acquisitions is independent of each other, and there is no guarantee that the term financing or any aspect therefore will happen.

Scientific Consensus Grows Stronger Scientific support for the 2009 finding has not weakened.
In Sept., the National Academies of Sciences released a fast-track review reaffirming that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, welfare, and climate stability.","NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming has joined a coalition of state financial officers that are part of a national conservative movement supporting the Environmental Protection Agency’s July 29 decision to rescind the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, a landmark climate ruling adopted after extensive scientific research concluded that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases harm human health and the environment. The rule had given the federal government authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.

The group, which includes 12 members of the State Financial Officers Foundation and four researchers from the American Institute for Economic Research, argues that the rule has imposed costly and unnecessary regulations on manufacturers and consumers while overstepping the EPA’s legal authority.

The 2009 finding gave the agency the power to set national vehicle-emission standards and other limits on greenhouse gases. Environmental groups have credited the policy with driving cleaner technologies and helping the U.S. reduce emissions, but opponents say it unnecessarily expanded federal reach. Fleming and his colleagues said the decision “triggered a wave of regulatory expansion without sufficient congressional oversight. It has imposed significant costs on consumers and manufacturers while failing to demonstrate meaningful environmental benefits.”

Economic Framing by State Financial Officers

Although the Endangerment Finding is an environmental and public-health determination, members of the State Financial Officers Foundation say the resulting regulations carry major financial consequences for state economies. The group contends that stricter federal climate rules increase production and energy costs, affecting industries, tax revenues, and public investment portfolios.

By weighing in, state treasurers argue they are defending fiscal stability and consumer affordability, not simply taking an environmental position. Critics, however, say the foundation’s members are stretching their role as financial stewards to advance a political agenda against climate action.

National Debate Over the EPA Proposal

On July 29, the Environmental Protection Agency formally rescinded the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, ending the agency’s determination that greenhouse gas emissions harm human health and the environment.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the change would lift what he called “hidden taxes” on businesses and consumers, while environmental and public health groups warned the move would gut the federal government’s ability to regulate climate pollution.

Following the announcement, scientists and advocacy organizations denounced the decision as a direct challenge to the Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling, which held that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, vowed to challenge the rollback in court, arguing that the EPA is legally obligated to regulate pollutants that endanger public health.

Scientific Consensus Grows Stronger

Scientific support for the 2009 finding has not weakened. If anything, it has grown stronger. Yet Fleming, a medical doctor, is challenging the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases to serious risks for human health and the environment.

In Sept., the National Academies of Sciences released a fast-track review reaffirming that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, welfare, and climate stability. The report concluded that the 2009 finding “was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” It noted that research since 2009 has expanded observational records and identified new health impacts linked to rising temperatures and pollution.

The National Academies’ report detailed a range of threats tied to greenhouse-gas-driven climate change, including increased heat-related illness and mortality, degraded air quality from ozone and particulate pollution, and more frequent floods and wildfires. The authors said evidence of harm has deepened across nearly every measure, and that “new evidence is developing about additional health impacts of climate-related exposures” not yet recognized in 2009.

That conclusion directly challenges claims by proponents of repeal who argue that current science is weaker or more uncertain than it was in 2009. Major research institutions, including the U.S. National Climate Assessment and international medical journals such as The Lancet, have likewise found that climate change is already contributing to worsening air quality, expanding disease risk, and causing thousands of premature deaths in the United States each year.

Federal Limits and State Authority

The push comes as recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have placed new limits on federal agencies, requiring clearer congressional authorization for major regulatory actions. Fleming said those decisions strengthen the case for revisiting the EPA’s climate authority.

“Revoking the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding will be a constructive move toward restoring a more balanced federal approach, one that aligns with the principles of competitive federalism,” Fleming said in a statement. “This shift will empower states to lead with innovative, tailored solutions to energy and climate challenges, fostering healthy competition among state governments and returning federal policy to its rightful, limited role.”

The State Financial Officers Foundation

The State Financial Officers Foundation is a nonprofit alliance of Republican state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers that advocates for what it calls “free-market” financial and energy policies.

Based in Kansas, the group has become a key player in national conservative efforts to challenge federal regulations and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment standards. Its members say they seek to protect taxpayers and promote fiscal responsibility, while critics describe the foundation as part of a broader political push to roll back climate and corporate accountability measures.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/10/State-Treasurer-Supports-Roll-Back-of-EPA-Climate-Regulations.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:20.948285

About College of Lake County","College of Lake County, in partnership with Lake County Workforce Development and The Community Works, recently announced the successful completion of the Energy Auditor Program by four participants through the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) Workforce Hub, a grant administered through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

This achievement marks an important step in preparing Lake County residents for in-demand careers in clean energy.

The Energy Auditor Program equips participants with the technical skills and credentials necessary to assess energy use, recommend efficiency improvements, and support homeowners and businesses in reducing costs and environmental impact.

Graduates of this program are positioned to enter a growing sector where clean energy jobs are projected to increase significantly over the next decade.

In addition to completing the program, all four graduates earned three nationally recognized Building Performance Institute (BPI) credentials: the Building Science Principles (BSP), Building Analyst Technician (BA-T), and Building Analyst Professional (BA-P).

These industry-standard certifications validate their knowledge of building science, energy efficiency, and home performance testing, positioning them as highly qualified professionals ready to enter the clean energy workforce.

The inaugural class of graduates includes: Udell Rogers, Christopher Berry, Justin Ortiz, and Mykhalio Perevalov. Each completer demonstrated persistence and commitment throughout the rigorous training program, guided by Lon Turner, lead instructor for Energy Auditing.

“These four graduates represent the promise of CEJA — empowering individuals with skills that create both career opportunity and community impact,” said Emily Echevarria, manager of workforce initiatives. “With the strong support of Lake County Workforce Development and The Community Works, these participants gained the training and wrap-around services they needed to succeed.”

The CEJA Workforce Hub, based at CLC’s Lakeshore Campus in Waukegan, provides a pathway for residents to access training, barrier-reduction support services, and career connections in clean energy industries such as EV Automotive, HVAC, and building and home inspection. The Energy Auditor Program is one of several specialized training opportunities offered through the Hub.

Graduates celebrated their achievement alongside family members, trainers, staff, and community partners at a recent recognition event. Local utilities and employers — including Nicor Gas, People’s Gas, North Shore Gas, and other clean energy stakeholders — attended to connect with completers and discuss employment opportunities.

This milestone underscores the Hub’s mission, shared by CLC, Lake County Workforce Development, and The Community Works, to ensure that Lake County residents have access to the skills and careers that will drive the future of energy.

Mercedes’ new platform supports EVs and internal combustion.

BMW is ditching bloated grilles for a slim look with its iX3 EV.

Electric vehicle developments from German automakers made news at Europe’s first auto shows of the fall.

Mercedes and BMW teased new architectures that will spin off multiple vehicles, Porsche embraced a new charging technology, VW showed four very small vehicles and Audi revealed its new face at Germany’s IAA show, now held in Munich after decades in Frankfurt.

Two new Mercedes EVs coming to USA

After initially saddling its EVs with confusing names like EQE sedan and EQE SUV, Mercedes is moving its electric vehicles to familiar model names.

The Mercedes-Benz’s compact GLC SUV and CLA sedan inaugurate the change with varying levels of grace.

Both vehicles offer 800-volt/350 kWh fast-charging capability to shorten stops. Arriving in the U.S. later this year, the CLA has a two-speed automatic transmission. Most EVs thus far operate with single-speed transmissions. Mercedes says its unit “combines dynamic performance with high efficiency for all driving situations.”

The sleek CLA will launch as an EV, with a hybrid coming for the 2027 model year.

The CLA EVs are identified by “with EQ technology” badging, proving Mercedes isn’t done with clumsy EV designations yet: The CLA 250+ with technology and all-wheel drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ technology.

What I’d give to be Mercedes’s chrome supplier.

The SUV ― likely to sell better, because, America ― is simply called GLC.

Arriving in the second half of 2026, the GLC SUV will tow 5,291 pounds and offer features including adaptive air suspension and four-wheel steering .

Porsche embraces wireless EV charging

Porsche has backed away from its schedule to cease using internal combustion engines, but the company’s march to electrification continues.

The electrically powered turbocharger that lit up the 911 GTS earlier this year does double duty in the 911 Turbo S twin-turbo, which accelerates to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds, reaches 124 mph in 8.4 seconds and tops out at 200 mph. The all-wheel drive Turbo S develops 701 hp.

For its purely electric vehicles, Porsche is adding wireless charging.

The system debuts in Europe next year. Other regions will get it later.

Porsche says its “one box” design eliminates the wall unit common to Level 2 240 volt home chargers.

The system will debut on the electric Cayenne, which will be shown later in 2025.

BMW ‘new class’ to underpin dozens of vehicles

Arriving in U.S. dealerships in 2026, BMW’s iX3 electric SUV is the first of what BMW promises “nearly 40 new models and model updates arriving between now and 2027” using the architecture and technologies in its Neue Klasse, or new class, engineering program.

The iX3 features a welcome departure from the cartoonishly inflated grilles on recent BMWs. The slimmed down double kidney grille gets optional lighting and returns to the vertical orientation BMW used in the 1960s and ‘70s.

At 188.3 inches, the iX3 is about an inch longer than the current X3.

Notable features include 800 volt charging that can accommodate even high levels for brief peaks. BMW promises up to 175 miles range in 10 minutes and 10%-80% charging as quick as 21 minutes.

Also of note:

Standard 20-inch wheels

Full-width, Lincoln Navigator-style instrument display

Touch screen controls

All-wheel drive

Up to 463 hp and 476 pound-feet of torque

48.1/51.6 front/rear weight distribution

Estimated 4.7 seconds 0-60 mph

Production begins in Debrecen, Hungary, early next year.

VW’s shows 4 very small EVs

Volkswagen pulled out all the stops with four small EVs slated for production starting in 2026. All are likely too small for U.S. sale.

For instance, the ID Cross SUV — at first glance the concept best suited to American tastes — is just 163.8 inches long.

That’s 15 inches shorter than the subcompact Chevrolet Trax, eight inches shorter than a Nissan Kicks.

The ID Cross uses a single electric motor for front-wheel drive and has a top speed of 108 mph, but it can tow more that 2,600 pounds up an 8% grade.

VW’s other EV concepts were a pair of subcompact cars, including one with bearing the popular GTI performance badge, and the “entry-level” ID Every1. The Every1 appears to be even smaller than the subcompact ID Polo and ID Polo GTI.

Audi's future face

Audi previewed an electric replacement for the discontinued TT sport coupe.

The two-seat Concept C features a retractable hardtop, ground-hugging bodywork, a long hood and short rear deck.

It’s intended to set the direction for an upcoming generation of Audi production vehicles. Audi’s weighing names for a production car based on the Concept C. TT is in the running, but the concept is considerably bigger than that model.

You can't buy a new Rivian vehicle for less than $71,000 right now, so the upcoming lower-priced models could potentially spark interest among more budget-conscious buyers.
First, the federal government ending the EV tax credits is a blow to the industry.
For the reasons listed above, I don't think Rivian stock is a millionaire maker.
I have a small position in Rivian, and I'm willing to wait out this rough patch to see what happens with the company, but expecting Rivian stock to mint millionaires doesn't look like a good bet.","Rivian (RIVN 0.30%) is gearing up for its launch of a new electric vehicle model next year, and is coming off a year in which it met gross profit milestones that unlocked additional funding from its partnership with Volkswagen.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that Rivian narrowed its vehicle delivery guidance for the year, the electric vehicle industry just had its federal tax credits axed, and the company reported a gross loss again in the most recent quarter.

To say Rivian's challenges are increasing would be an understatement. Here's why Rivian stock likely won't make you a millionaire anytime soon.

Rivian's slow but steady progress

They say it's always best to start with the good news, so here's what Rivian has going for it right now, starting with the company's upcoming cheaper models. Rivian will begin selling its smaller R2 SUV next year and R3 crossover in 2027. The former will start at just $45,000 while the latter has an estimated price tag of around $40,000.

Those are important price points because they're below the average price of a new EV, which is currently around $57,000. Potential EV buyers often cite cost as a concern when considering an electric vehicle, and for EVs to gain ground in the market, their prices need to come down. You can't buy a new Rivian vehicle for less than $71,000 right now, so the upcoming lower-priced models could potentially spark interest among more budget-conscious buyers.

What's more, Rivian has proved that it can run an efficient EV business after reporting two consecutive quarters of positive gross profit. Management set a goal to achieve that, and it did so, in part, by retooling and reengineering its manufacturing process last year -- cutting up to 35% in material costs for some vehicles. Achieving that goal also unlocked $1 billion in additional funding from its partner, Volkswagen, which was another win for Rivian.

Unfortunately, even after notching these wins, Rivian is still in uncharted territory.

The road to success is long, winding, and uncertain

Despite Rivian's successes and its pipeline of new models, the company is facing an arduous path. First, the federal government ending the EV tax credits is a blow to the industry. Rivian's vehicles didn't qualify for the credit because they're too expensive, but the company was able to take advantage of a leasing loophole that helped lower costs for some customers.

Making matters worse for Rivian is that after two consecutive quarters of positive gross profit, the company slipped back into the red in the second quarter. That may not have been such a big deal if everything else was humming along for the company, but it came just ahead of Rivian's management narrowing its full-year vehicle guidance.

Rivian now expects deliveries between 41,500 to 43,500 -- lower than its previous midpoint guidance by about 500 vehicles. That's the company's second revision this year. When Rivian started its production year, it first estimated deliveries of up to 51,000.

What's especially disappointing is that deliveries for Q3 were actually up by 32% from the year-ago quarter, but the company's revised full-year delivery guidance was adjusted down, likely due to the federal tax incentives being eliminated and tariff uncertainty. While some of the delivery increases were likely due to customers signing up for leases before the tax credits expired, there's no getting around the fact that the current 2025 estimates are nearly 18% lower than 2024's deliveries.

Is Rivian a millionaire maker?

For the reasons listed above, I don't think Rivian stock is a millionaire maker. I have a small position in Rivian, and I'm willing to wait out this rough patch to see what happens with the company, but expecting Rivian stock to mint millionaires doesn't look like a good bet.

That doesn't mean Rivian isn't a good company or won't be a good long-term investment, but investors should know that the EV industry is facing significant headwinds and Rivian will likely face more hurdles ahead as it tries to build its EV future.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/836210/r1s_woods.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 09:59:18.125289

Rivian founder and CEO R.J Scaringe, who has been called the “anti-Elon” by some, is excited to launch the electric vehicle manufacturer’s more affordable R2, which he calls “insanely good.”

“I've never been more confident in the company than I am today,” Scaringe said during an Automotive Press Association event at the company's development, prototyping and testing facility in Plymouth Township, Michigan.

He’s not concerned about the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit and he says he’s aligned with the Trump administration, which is advocating for more U.S. production.

Rivian assembles all its vehicles in Normal, Illinois, is building a plant in Georgia, and will source batteries for R2 from Arizona after LG Energy Solution launches production there in mid-2026.

The Rivian R2 remains on track for a $45,000 starting price -- lower than the average -- with production beginning in the first half of 2026.

“The R2 isn't just a great EV, it's an incredible vehicle,” he says. “It offers acceleration; it’s like a sports car that can go off-road.”

Scaringe predicts about two-thirds of customers will elect to buy the R2 rather than lease it, and that two-thirds of the vehicles cross-shopped with the R2 will not be EVs.

“I'm highly biased, but I can't imagine not buying this,” Scaringe says. “For the longest time, the electrified space, there's been a singular set of great choices. There's been the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3. They are great cars. They're highly compelling. They're well executed. But it's remarkable that they've maintained such extraordinary market share that they control about 50% of the sales in the United States.”

While many of the automaker’s employees have shifted to its California facilities, Rivian still has about 1,000 employees in Michigan.

The historic space, designed by noted industrial architect Albert Kahn, includes a call center for customers to access experts, vehicle testing, virtual reality manufacturing station layout review and 3D printing for prototype parts and tools.

After the Q&A with Scaringe, media members were invited on a tour and given a 3D printed plastic R2 model, which they said took about 20 minutes to print (see photo below.) The building has a very Rivian vibe, including a neon sign that reads “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few are dirt.”

Scaringe, who knew at age 10 he wanted to start a car company, is a serious environmentalist -- and the building reflects that. There are trash containers throughout that offer the choice of compost, mixed recycling or landfill. The continental breakfast served before the talk was served on compostable dinnerware.

Badenoch said if she became prime minister, she would scrap the 2008 Climate Change Act, which set targets for cutting emissions and reaching net zero. She promised to replace it with a new plan focused on “cheap energy”.

Speaking to BBC North East & Cumbria, she said: “They are destroying more jobs than they are creating. We are bankrupting our economy. Oil and gas is disappearing, manufacturing is disappearing.”

Badenoch argued that current net zero targets were driving businesses abroad due to high energy costs. “I’ve heard businesses all around the country say we can’t afford the energy prices here and it is because of a lot of the decisions we are taking on net zero,” she said.

Her comments drew criticism from industry and opposition parties.

Energy UK, which represents most power generators and suppliers, warned the move would damage investor confidence.

Chief executive Dhara Vyas said: “Treating the Climate Change Act as a political football is a sure fire way to scare off investors. Pulling out the rug from under these critical investments will do nothing to lower energy bills.”

Labour’s Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland MP Luke Myer said the plan would risk “thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of investment” in Teesside and beyond.

Chief Executive Elon Musk for years has promised mass market vehicles, though last year he canceled plans to build an all-new $25,000 EV, Reuters first reported. The car expected this week is an ""affordable"" vehicle based on current manufacturing and design platforms.

Tesla posted two clips on X over the weekend, igniting excitement among Tesla fans. One video shows headlights peering out of the dark and another shows what looks like a wheel spinning for a few seconds, followed by ""10/7"", the US format for the date October 7.

Neither Tesla nor influencers have indicated that an in-person event is in the works, in contrast to previous major Tesla launches. Still, analysts, investors and fans expect the company to make some kind of announcement.

Major questions include the car's price, driving range and efforts to strip down costs. Late last year, Musk said the vehicle would be priced below the ""key threshold"" of $30,000 including US EV tax credits.

In the United States, prices effectively rose by $7,500 at the end of last month, when the credit ended. That helped goose quarterly sales to a record, but expectations are that they will slow down for the rest of the year, unless the affordable car comes to the rescue.

""The desire to buy the car is very high. (It's) just (that) people don't have enough money in the bank account to buy it,"" Musk said in July during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call. ""So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.""

Musk initially promised that production of the vehicle would start by the end of June. But Tesla only made what it called ""first builds"" of the car, it said in July, adding that it would be available for customers sometime in the last three months of the year.

Tesla has already been grappling with slowing sales of its aging lineup as competition has grown rapidly, especially in China and Europe, where Musk's far-right political views also have undermined brand loyalty.

Earlier this year, Tesla launched a refreshed version of the Model Y with improvements including new light bars and a rear touchscreen.

Musk has been pivoting the company toward artificial intelligence, focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla has said it will launch more affordable vehicles in its lineup but has not provided details. Sources have told Reuters the EV maker also plans to roll out a stripped down version of its Model 3 midsize sedan.

Affordable cars will also be key to Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles over the next decade - one of the several operational and valuation milestones set by the company's board as part of its proposed $1 pay package for Musk.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/11745384252-0/11745384252-0-640x480.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:06:20.534040

In the U.S. and the E.U., however, clean power growth did not keep up with power demand and fossil generation ticked upward.
""So, this clean energy growth is really cleaning up other sectors.""
Clean energy expert Mark Jacobson is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Atmosphere and Energy Program.
He used two leading clean energy states in the U.S., California and Texas, as an example of what's possible through efficiency.","The first half of 2025 brought a small but potentially significant tipping point in the global energy system, according to the independent clean energy research group Ember.

""Clean sources grew more than demand and therefore they displaced some fossil fuels,"" Ember's Senior Electricity Analyst Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka told Newsweek.

The remarkable growth in clean energy has, until now, been more about energy addition than energy transition, as the global growth in demand used up both the power from fossil fuels and new renewable sources.

In the first six months of this year, however, that appears to have shifted in what Wiatros-Motyka called ""the first signs of a crucial turning point"" where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth and beginning to muscle out fossil fuels.

""For the first time ever, we saw renewables overtaking coal generation globally,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.

Solar power alone met more than 80 percent of new electricity demand, she said, as solar deployment soared and prices for solar equipment continued to decline.

The Ember research found that fossil fuel generation fell in both China and India.

China is both the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions and by far the world's clean energy leader. China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, Ember found, and its fossil generation dropped by 2 percent compared to the previous year.

In India, renewable energy sources grew more than three times bigger than the country's growth in power demand in the first half of the year.

In the U.S. and the E.U., however, clean power growth did not keep up with power demand and fossil generation ticked upward. In the E.U., the report found, countries relied on more gas and coal power as the output from wind and hydro sources dipped.

""So, emerging markets are leading the way at the moment,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.

The Ember report covers only the global electricity sector, and no other energy uses such as transportation and industry where fossil fuels still dominate. However, Wiatros-Motyka pointed out, electricity is becoming a bigger part of the total energy picture with the rapid rise of EVs, the wider adoption of heat pumps and battery energy storage.

""We have electrification of a number of sectors now,"" she said. ""So, this clean energy growth is really cleaning up other sectors.""

Sam Kimmins, director of energy at the nonprofit Climate Group, told Newsweek via email that Ember's work ""highlights a new milestone"" in the economics of clean energy as companies demand the cheaper, faster power that renewables offer.

""Their purchasing power and influence is re-making the energy system,"" Kimmins said. ""Governments risk losing business to more competitive markets if they fail to act quickly to improve access to renewables.""

Brendan Pierpont directs electricity modeling at the independent energy think tank Energy Innovation. Pierpont said the growth of wind and solar globally shows that these are the ""cheapest sources of new electrons"" and are quickly becoming more competitive with coal and gas.

""Global renewable energy deployment keeps exceeding our expectations,"" Pierpont told Newsweek, as actual measures of wind and solar deployment outdo the forecasts from major monitoring organizations like the International Energy Agency.

""It's getting cheaper and easier to integrate these resources on grids as the cost of complementary resources like energy storage also falls in tandem,"" he said.

Clean energy expert Mark Jacobson is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Atmosphere and Energy Program. Jacobson told Newsweek via email that Ember research is ""positive news,"" but said he is not quite ready to declare a turning point in the energy transition until he sees a sustained trend in which ""fossil fuel use continues to drop while renewables rise over a two-year period.""

Jacobson said the Ember research also points to the potential gains from rooftop solar and energy efficiency improvements to further blunt demand for electricity from the grid.

He used two leading clean energy states in the U.S., California and Texas, as an example of what's possible through efficiency. While both states have added enormous amounts of wind, solar and battery storage, ""the average person in California uses 40 percent of the electricity as the average person in Texas"" due to energy efficiency measures for buildings and appliances, he said.

Jacobson said the U.S. could match or exceed the drop in fossil generation that China saw in the first half of this year if it pursued a more aggressive development of renewable energy. However, he said, the Trump administration's energy strategy is moving in the other direction, encouraging more use of gas and coal.

""The challenge is that the U.S. has now embarked on a policy to stop renewable growth and increase fossil fuel growth,"" Jacobson said, ""potentially slowing the world's efforts to reach a real turning point in the energy transition.""

Wiatros-Motyka said Ember's data indicates that the clean transition is ""unstoppable"" and the trend of fossil fuel displacement will continue.

""More than half the world's economies are already past the peak of fossil fuels,"" she said. ""So, there is no turning back now, I believe, from this moment.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2729096/clean-energy-growth-illustration.png,N,,2025-10-07 12:08:39.983564

Together, these universities represent one of the most research-intensive coalitions in the nation, uniquely positioned to address the complex challenges at the intersection of environment, economy, and community.

This year, RU4M launched the Liveable Futures Initiative, a platform designed to catalyze collaborative, cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive in the face of climate change, flooding, pollution, and other sustainability challenges. The initiative fosters partnerships, funds seed projects, and accelerates innovation aimed at making Michigan — and the Great Lakes region — a global hub for sustainable solutions.

As a sponsor of the Sustainable Urban Design Summit (SUDS), RU4M is amplifying this mission, bringing academic research into conversation with practitioners, policymakers, and community leaders. Detroitisit spoke with Dr. Britany Affolter-Caine, executive director of RU4M, and Vince Nystrom, program director, about the power of collaboration, the role of research universities in Michigan’s sustainability journey, and the opportunities ahead.

REGISTER FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN DESIGN SUMMIT 2025 , NOV, 6 AT NEWLAB DETROIT HERE.

How does RU4M’s collaborative model strengthen Michigan’s ability to tackle complex issues like climate resilience and sustainability?

Britany Affolter-Caine: Michigan is fortunate to have four of the nation’s highest-intensity research universities, and not every state can say that. Each brings deep expertise, but when we connect them, align agendas, and foster collaboration, the impact multiplies. Sustainability challenges — from climate change to clean water access — are too big for any single institution to solve alone.

That’s why we launched the Liveable Futures Initiative. It’s designed to seed and support collaborative research across institutions that directly addresses the issues shaping Michigan’s future: flooding, water quality, microplastics, algae blooms, and infrastructure resilience. It’s about creating solutions that make this state not just livable, but thriving, for generations to come.

How do you align the unique strengths of Michigan State, Michigan Tech, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State toward common goals?

Vince Nystrom: We start by mapping the research landscape in detail — tracking projects, funding, and outputs across institutions. Over the last five years, these universities have generated more than a billion dollars in sustainability research. By aggregating that data, we can see where expertise already overlaps and where it can be complementary.

For example, some universities are deeply invested in hydrogen research as a clean energy source, while others focus on water infrastructure or materials science. RU4M’s role is to connect these dots, highlight opportunities for collaboration, and make sure the state and industry partners know how to tap into this expertise when real-world challenges arise.

There’s often tension between environmental stewardship and economic growth. How does RU4M view this balance?

Affolter-Caine: For us, it’s not “either/or” — it’s the power of and. Sustainability and economic growth can reinforce one another if approached strategically. Take mobility: when new facilities are being built, like the Los Alamos-linked AI center in Ypsilanti Township, the conversation isn’t just about technology. It’s also about environmental standards, community impact, and long-term resilience.

Nystrom: At the research level, we see this duality all the time. Michigan State is testing bioreactors to reduce farm runoff. Michigan Tech is advancing natural resource management alongside engineering solutions. These projects protect the environment while building new industries, jobs, and opportunities.

Water is central to Michigan’s identity. What do you see as the most pressing water-related challenges, and how are universities helping address them?

Affolter-Caine: Flooding is a major one. Detroit has seen catastrophic flooding in recent years, and the Midland dam failure was another wake-up call. We need smarter infrastructure and policy solutions, and our universities are leading research on both fronts.

Microplastics are another urgent issue. Bills are moving through the Michigan Senate right now, and researchers are at the table providing science-based guidance. That’s where our role is so critical — connecting cutting-edge science with policy and practice.

Nystrom: Beyond urban flooding and water quality, there’s also a huge economic and ecological dimension. From rebuilding the Soo Locks to protecting outdoor recreation, water drives both industry and community life here. Universities are advancing technologies for oil spill prevention, fresh water protection, and agricultural water efficiency.

From your vantage point, what role will AI and advanced manufacturing play in tackling sustainability challenges?

Britany Affolter-Caine: AI is one of our verticals, and we’re seeing it play two roles. On the one hand, researchers are advancing AI itself as a technology. On the other, more and more teams are using AI as a tool to accelerate their own work. For example, when we faced the challenge of PFAS contamination, AI helped identify and map the many different compounds — short- and long-chain variants — much faster than traditional methods. That kind of pattern recognition and data processing makes it possible to reach solutions more quickly.

Vince Nystrom: What’s powerful about AI is that it operates both as a standalone sector and as an enabler across every other sector. Whether it’s mobility, clean energy, or water, AI is being embedded into research and development as a force multiplier. Advanced manufacturing works in much the same way — it provides the tools and methods that make scaling these innovations possible.

How are students being prepared to enter careers at this intersection of science, sustainability, and economic development?

Affolter-Caine: RU4M acts as a conduit, ensuring industry needs are reflected in university programs. We ask employers what skills they’re looking for, feed that information back into curricula, and track how students are graduating into these critical fields.

Nystrom: The entrepreneurial piece is also growing. Each university has accelerators, incubators, and programs that encourage students to build their own ventures. We’ve already seen spinouts ranging from advanced materials to clean-tech startups. In fact, one in five of our alumni become entrepreneurs — and many are now tackling sustainability challenges directly.

When you look ahead, where can Michigan lead most strongly in the global sustainability conversation?

Affolter-Caine: Water is where we have unmatched potential. Few regions in the world can rival Michigan’s freshwater resources or the scale of expertise we’ve built around them. At the same time, energy storage and clean mobility will be critical. But water innovation — quality, management, resilience — is where we can truly lead.

Nystrom: Michigan gets called the “Saudi Arabia of water.” That abundance comes with responsibility. If we manage it wisely, Michigan can set the standard globally for how water is protected, leveraged, and sustained for both economy and environment.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-9.12.54-AM-1024x722.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:33.556476

Project converts landfill methane into clean fuel

Renewable gas will flow directly into the South Jersey Gas network

Facility cuts emissions, supports local jobs & energy independence

The launch of a new renewable natural gas facility marks a major clean energy milestone in South Jersey.

A partnership among Opal Fuels, South Jersey Industries and the Atlantic County Utilities Authority developed the project. According to an Oct. 6 announcement, the RNG facility is now fully operational at the ACUA landfill in Egg Harbor Township. It marks a first-of-its-kind renewable energy development for the region.

Located on ACUA’s solid waste landfill site, the facility captures methane gas generated from decomposing waste and refines it into renewable natural gas. It not only cuts greenhouse gas emissions but also turns what was once waste into a sustainable source of local energy.

The facility has a nameplate capacity of 2,500 standard cubic feet per minute of landfill gas. It is expected to produce more than 650,000 MMBtu annually — the equivalent of more than 4.6 million gallons of gasoline each year. The facility will distribute the fuel into the South Jersey Gas pipeline system, a subsidiary of SJI.

This marks the company’s first RNG project to deliver renewable fuel directly into its network.

First, not last

“We are thrilled to cut the ribbon on this project, which signifies another significant milestone for SJI,” said Chet Benham, president of SJI Renewable Energy Ventures.

“The launch of this facility marks an important milestone in Opal Fuels’ mission of turning waste into clean, domestic energy,” said Opal Fuels co-CEO Adam Comora. “This project reduces emissions, improves local air quality, creates jobs, and strengthens American energy independence.”

“ACUA is proud to continue its long history of innovation by becoming the first public solid waste facility in New Jersey to host an RNG project,” said ACUA President Matthew DeNafo. “Because of the shared environmental leadership among OPAL, SJI and ACUA, landfill gas is now a renewable energy source for our community.”

Benham added, “This project underscores our commitment to innovation and continuing efforts in renewable energy solutions.”

U.S. light-vehicle sales rose 3.5% year-over-year in September, reaching a 16.4 million SAAR.

BEVs reached a record 11.8% market share as buyers took advantage of expiring tax credits.

Industry forecasts now project 15.9 million total light-vehicle sales for 2025.

New light-vehicle sales in the United States climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.4 million units in September 2025, up 3.5% from a year earlier, as buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. According to the NADA’s September Market Beat report, the strong performance was driven in part by “pull-ahead” demand ahead of the credit deadline.

Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales reached a record 11.8% of all new vehicles sold, nearly two percentage points higher than in August. BEVs also recorded a 24.1% year-over-year increase in the third quarter and accounted for 8.4% of total new vehicle sales through the first nine months of 2025, up 0.7 percentage points from the same period last year. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) models, which were also eligible for the federal incentive, maintained a flat 1.7% monthly market share and 1.8% year-to-date share.

Analysts said the strong September performance reflected consumers rushing to take advantage of the final days of the tax credit. The surge helped offset slowing growth earlier in the quarter as automakers faced tariff pressures and rising production costs.

According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per new vehicle rose slightly from August to $3,116, with more funds directed toward EVs. Incentive spending represented 6.1% of the average vehicle’s sticker price, compared with 4.8% for non-EVs.

Inventory levels also showed modest improvement. Combined dealer and in-transit light-vehicle inventory reached 2.65 million units by the end of September, up 6.2% from August but still 5.9% below the same period last year.

Automakers, including GM, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Honda, and Tesla, all gained market share through September, while Nissan and Volkswagen reported declines. Crossovers continued to dominate the market with a 49.2% share, followed by pickups at 18.7%.

Despite ongoing concerns about tariffs and upcoming model-year price hikes, industry analysts remain cautiously optimistic.

“Australian households and small businesses have already embraced rooftop solar in record numbers, with more than 4.2 million having made the switch, and 800,000 of those from Victoria, while large-scale renewable developers are building utility solar at pace,” said Con Hristodoulidis, general manager – distributed energy, Clean Energy Council.

Under the program, a 200kW solar system generating around 600kWh per day could reduce energy costs, improving cash flow for businesses while lowering emissions and operating expenses.

According to Hristodoulidis, the commercial and industrial sector – long seen as the “missing middle” between household and utility-scale renewables – stands to benefit significantly from the initiative. He noted that large rooftops, such as those on warehouses and supermarkets, offer strong potential for solar generation, reducing payback periods and easing energy costs for both businesses and consumers.

In its annual Renewables 2025 report out on Tuesday, the agency slashed its growth forecasts for clean energy capacity extensions by 45% compared to the growth of about 500 gigawatts (GW) expected last year.

“The forecast for the United States is revised down by almost 50%,” the IEA said.

“This reflects several policy changes, including the earlier phase out of federal tax credits, new import restrictions, the suspension of new offshore wind leasing and restricting the permitting of onshore wind and solar PV projects on federal land.”

Last month, the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) quarterly report showed that the clean power development pipeline showed virtually no growth, expanding by less than 100 MW to 184.5 GW, solar installations slumped by 23% in the first half of 2025, and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) plummeted. These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” ACP said.

“Federal policy actions from nearly every department and an unstable tariff environment have led to a drop in clean power purchasing and planning for the future—despite skyrocketing demand nationwide,” the association added.

U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy has estimated that almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled since President Trump took office.

The IEA’s expectations for U.S. renewable capacity growth are now aligned with unfavorable policies for clean energy this decade. But the Paris-based agency strongly promoting renewables has also cut its growth projections for global additions and for additions in China, the world’s biggest renewables market.

Growth estimates for the world and in China were revised down by 5% each compared to the 2024 forecast.

“China’s shift from fixed tariffs to auctions is impacting project economics and lowering growth expectations,” the IEA said.

The offshore wind sector is projected to create 29,000 jobs, generate a £4.5 billion economic impact, and power more than four million homes across Wales by 2030. Total offshore wind capacity is forecasted to reach over 20 gigawatts around Wales by 2045.

Located less than 50km from designated development areas in the Celtic Sea, with a coastline that delivers natural deep-water harbours and established supply chains, the Prospectus showcases how Welsh ports are uniquely placed to capitalise on this opportunity.

This is alongside the existing opportunity off the north Wales coastline, where more than 500 wind turbines have already been positioned from the Port of Mostyn, and where Wales is home to the UK’s first fixed bottom offshore wind farm.

Wales’ two Freeports provide investors with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes, and development-ready sites, while a wide range of financial support is available to companies via investment and infrastructure programmes. The Welsh Government is also investing in renewable energy skills across Wales.

Speaking ahead of the Future Energy Wales conference, hosted by RenewableUK Cymru at the ICC Wales in Newport, Rebecca Evans, said:

The UK's clean energy revolution is a generational opportunity to build a cleaner, more prosperous future for our communities whilst delivering the infrastructure Britain needs for energy security.

Wales stands at the heart of the clean energy transition – with a coastline that delivers natural deep-water harbours, proximity to major wind lease zones, and an agile, ready-to-scale supply chain we represent one of Europe’s most strategic locations for offshore wind development.

Earlier this year, the company launched a refreshed Model Y featuring new light bars and a rear touchscreen.","Tesla is expected to unveil a more affordable version of its best-selling Model Y SUV on Tuesday, aiming to reverse declining sales and shrinking market share amid increasing global competition. CEO Elon Musk has long promised mass-market electric vehicles, although plans for a new $25,000 EV were scrapped last year.

The upcoming model is expected to be based on existing manufacturing and design platforms, making it more accessible without requiring a complete redesign.

Over the weekend, Tesla stirred anticipation by posting teaser clips on social media showing headlights and a spinning wheel alongside the date “10/7”, the US format for October 7. Unlike previous major launches, there is no indication of an in-person event, but analysts, investors, and fans are expecting an announcement.

Key details such as price, driving range, and cost-cutting measures remain uncertain. Last year, Musk indicated the vehicle would be priced below $30,000 after US EV tax credits.

Those credits, however, expired at the end of September, effectively raising prices by $7,500 and prompting a temporary boost in sales ahead of the deadline. Analysts expect demand to slow in the months ahead unless Tesla’s new budget-friendly option helps offset the impact.

“The desire to buy the car is very high,” Musk said during Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call in July. “It’s just that people don’t have enough money in the bank account to buy it. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

Musk previously indicated that production would begin by the end of June, but Tesla later clarified that only “first builds” had been completed. The company now expects the new model to reach customers sometime during the final quarter of the year.

Tesla has faced slowing demand for its ageing line-up, while rivals in China and Europe continue to gain ground. Musk’s increasingly polarising political views have also dented brand loyalty in some key markets. Even so, Tesla reported a rise in sales across several European countries in September.

Earlier this year, the company launched a refreshed Model Y featuring new light bars and a rear touchscreen. Musk is also shifting focus toward artificial intelligence projects such as robotaxis and humanoid robots, with plans to introduce more affordable vehicles, including a simplified version of the Model 3 sedan.

Delivering affordable cars is crucial for Tesla’s goal of producing 20 million vehicles over the next decade. This target is part of ambitious milestones tied to Musk’s proposed $1 trillion pay package approved by the company’s board.

Party leaders in Congress once boasted about finding conservative solutions to global warning, and rank-and-file lawmakers discussed pressure from constituents and activists to act. Now, President Donald Trump’s pro-fossil-fuel ethos is firmly in control.

A handful of Republicans lawmakers still talk about the need to promote renewable energy, but they are increasingly isolated in a party focused on fighting what conservatives call the Democrats’ “Green New Scam.”

“We seem to be in a political retrograde, and yet emissions continue to rise,” said Republican Alex Flint, executive director of the group Alliance for Market Solutions, a conservative group focused on reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.

A lot has changed in a fairly short time. In 2016, House Republicans started joining a bipartisan caucus focused on climate solutions. And in 2019, GOP star pollster Frank Luntz urged the federal government to act on climate, publicly disavowing comments he made 20 years prior.

After Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 and Democrats regained control of Congress, then-House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) created a task force to deal with climate and conservation issues.

Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, now the Republican whip, five years ago talked up “climate resilience” and at one point said of GOP lawmakers, “We all believe climate change is real. We believe mankind is certainly contributing to that.”

Asked last week about action on climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Barrasso said, “Finally, the Republicans are doing the right thing to become energy dominant for this nation in spite of the fact Joe Biden put our head in the noose in the fight against China by shutting down American energy and prioritizing climate over energy that’s available, affordable and reliable.”

Trump himself has repeatedly called human-made climate change a hoax. And Energy Secretary Chris Wright called the international Paris climate agreement “silly.”

The conservative and bipartisan climate caucuses do still exist on Capitol Hill, and so do a small number of Hill Republicans who talk openly about climate change — including Sens. John Curtis of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.

But while dozens of House Republicans signaled their support for protecting renewable energy tax incentives, the party was largely unified in voting to phase them out.

Murkowski and Curtis did help strike a last-minute deal to make that phase-out more lenient. But they have not pushed back, at least not publicly, on the administration’s plans to roll back an EPA decision that underpins federal regulations against greenhouse gas emissions. Murkowski said the move was “not unexpected.”

Tom Pyle, head of the conservative Institute for Energy Research, said, “The climate wing of the GOP has been clipped by reality. Heck, even the Democrats aren’t talking about climate anymore.”

Interviews with lawmakers, advocates and administration officials show how the landscape for climate action feels much different under Trump 2.0 — with many Republicans moving away from well worn arguments against picking winners and losers in energy.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) say the shift in his party is a reaction to Biden-era green energy policies, which he said were too harsh on fossil fuels.

“We had everybody saying you just got to go all renewable, forget the reasonable transition. Now, you got people going the opposite direction,” said Tillis, a moderate who is retiring from Congress next year.

“I think most members are still in the same place,” said Tillis. “Intuitively, they know it’s an all-of-the-above strategy.”

Others attribute the GOP’s increased hostility to wind and solar on the administration’s rhetoric and the decreasing prominence of climate change as an electoral issue.

“The sobering lesson we may be learning is that Trump has correctly judged that politics is about the short term — the consequences be damned,” Flint said.

Clean energy Republicans are not gone, said Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations at the sustainability group Ceres. They are just “shell-shocked” by administration actions.

Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a group that works with Republicans on climate and renewable energy issues, said: “No one has successfully gotten in Trump’s bull’s-eye and withstood it.”

She said, “House members being singled out by the president, in any administration — that’s tough. In this administration, that could be the end of a congressional career: ‘Why should I stick my head out on something that’s not a top voter issue?'”

The election results are a big reason why Democrats are joining climate-minded Republicans in highlighting the economic benefits of renewable energy development rather than its benefits for the planet.

“Those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).

Reams said of climate-minded Republicans, “I think we are in an evolving time. It’s not like we’ve gone from A to B. … I think we are amidst the journey, and we haven’t landed on anything else. It’s kind of hard to put your finger on it.”

Chris Barnard, president of the right-wing American Conservation Coalition, said, “I think the way that we framed it is like — ‘the climate hawk is dead, what comes next?’ And it should be something that aligns energy dominance needs with reindustrialization, with climate co-benefits as a result,” Barnard said. “It’s just a new way of approaching and thinking about these issues.”

Advocates on the left say the Republican Party has had plenty of time to show its true colors on climate action.

“I think assuming congressional Republicans are going to stick up for renewable energy is a mistake,” said Emily Becker, a deputy director at the center-left think tank Third Way. “How many times do we need to touch a hot stove?”

‘All folded like origami’

Republicans’ posture toward clean energy and climate change was on full display during this year’s monthslong fight to pass their One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

GOP moderates, particularly in the House, ceded ground on renewable energy, allowing the near-immediate phase-outs of wind and solar tax credits. The Senate eased but didn’t prevent the incentives’ demise.

Even though the megalaw preserved credits for geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear, House moderates caved when it came to extending tax credits for wind and solar — even after 21 GOP members signed letters urging leniency.

The night before the House voted on its version, Garbarino stormed out of the speaker’s office saying he was “not happy.” Garbarino, co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, ended up missing that early morning roll call but said he would have supported the legislation.

“They all folded like origami,” Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said of the 21 Republicans. “Even to the detriment of their own districts, where these investments have been made. It just hasn’t grown into a policy-making effort. It seems it’s maybe political cover for them.”

But reflecting later on the chain of events, Garbarino rejected accusations that his pro-renewable-energy positions were political cover.

“If it wasn’t for the work prior to the Big Beautiful Bill, everything would have been repealed right away. It was the work we did, both publicly and behind the scenes, both here in the House and Senate, I think that got us to the final language,” the New Yorker said.

“Was the final language perfect? No, the language wasn’t perfect on a lot of things, but it was not a full repeal which a lot of people demanded. I am happy. I am satisfied with what we got in the bill. … It gives people time.”

Sarah Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, which mostly supports Democrats, said pro-renewables advocacy from some Republicans has been positive. The group has launched a $4 million campaign to denounce what it calls the “Big Ugly Bill.”

“I don’t want to greenwash it, but I think how some Republicans in Congress are now talking about clean energy as something we need to get on the grid for energy security and to lower cost impacts is an important shift from even five years ago,” she said.

What about Miller-Meeks?

One key player appeared to be working mostly behind the scenes: Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), who chairs the House’s Conservative Climate Caucus.

Last year, the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) named Miller-Meeks renewable energy champion of the year, and she defended the clean energy credits to top tax Republican Rep. Jason Smith in April. But the swing state congresswoman was relatively quiet during the late-stage public fights over the credits.

Miller-Meeks’ approach was a departure from that of Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 when he was a House member. As caucus leader, Curtis was one of the most vocal GOP representatives when it came to climate issues and has continued that work in the Senate.

With Tillis and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Curtis helped delay fast confirmation of some administration nominees over renewable energy concerns and how the administration would implement the phase-out of incentives.

Curtis has also reached out to conservatives like fellow Utah, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Sen. Mike Lee. “We’ve talked more about what I’m doing, and I’ll just say: He’s not very critical of what I’m doing,” said Curtis.

In an email through her office, Miller-Meeks defended her work, saying the tax credits ended up “in a far better position than I could have hoped this time last year.”

“When we sent the first letter, to Speaker Johnson, asserting Republican support for a more comprehensive conversation on energy tax credits we were fighting against full repeal,” she wrote.

“As more projects were built and came online, the urgency of meeting demand for AI and meetings the energy needs of AI increased, and politization died down, and a reasonable conversation about the benefits of the tax credits emerged.”

Miller-Meeks, who is facing a tough reelection fight, said she helped educate House Republican colleagues about the benefits of renewable energy tax credits and ended up with a compromise.

“But after many conversations with a variety of stakeholders everyone understands the timeline and good projects will continue to be built,” she said.

The group Climate Power, which has Democratic ties, says the GOP agenda is threatening more than 100 clean energy projects and thousands of jobs.

“The credits were never going to last forever and the is a reasonable runway for businesses to meet US energy needs and continue to build out and strengthen our energy system,” said Miller-Meeks.

‘Things appear to be worse’

Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who founded the Climate Solutions Caucus in 2016, said that while Trump may be shifting rightward on climate, the megabill fight actually signaled that not all Hill Republicans are following.

“On the surface, things appear to be worse,” said Curbelo. “Trump 2.0 is definitely looking at climate and energy issues through the lens of the culture wars. Certainly that’s a lot more prevalent in the administration than it was the first time around.”

But beneath the surface, Republican support has not diminished, Curbelo argued — in fact, on the Hill, the opposite is true. He pointed to a failed amendment from Lee that would have scrapped the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy. It went down 21-79.

Curbelo says it’s notable that at least some of the Democrats’ 2022 climate law survived this year when Republicans in 2023 expressed support for full repeal under pressure from the far right during debt ceiling negotiations.

“It depends on your perspective and where you want to start measuring from,” Curbelo said. “But certainly anyone should have expected this to be a major target for the Republican trifecta and the truth is we landed somewhere between the scalpel and the sledgehammer approach and I think significant investments were protected.”

Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell unseated Curbelo in 2018 elections. She was then ousted by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez, who went from stressing climate issues as mayor of Miami-Dade County to downplaying them in Congress.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/eb/ae/c28c2ce64ffcba39a1ee51649e98/congress-tax-cuts-84663.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 06:59:43.948468

But a major shift in federal policy could put the brakes on that momentum. The federal tax credit for electric vehicles has officially expired, putting what was once viewed as the future of driving in jeopardy.

For years, the $7,500 credit helped make EVs more affordable. It boosted consumer demand and pushed automakers to invest heavily in electric models.

Now, without that incentive, executives warn of a sharp drop in EV sales. Ford's CEO says market share could fall to just 4% to 5% by year's end.

Dealers currently sit on about 134,000 unsold EVs — that's roughly two months' worth of inventory at current sales rates.

To soften the blow, some automakers are stepping in. Ford and GM are offering lease deals that mimic the credit. Hyundai is cutting prices on certain models.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-10-07 10:33:04+00:00,NPR,A tribe in Arizona planned to connect 600 homes to electricity. Then the funding was cut - NPR,"Nate Perez, Ryan Kellman",,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5453913/trump-hopi-tribes-native-americans-clean-energy,"Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity.
The Hopi were approved for a $25 million grant to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.","For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.

But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States.

Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.

""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.

The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing nearly $2 billion to tribes to invest in renewable energy.

The Hopi were approved for a $25 million grant to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.

But in August, the Trump administration terminated the Solar for All program, calling it wasteful.

Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.

""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

A game changer for tribes

The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated 54,000 tribal members across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.

""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when tribes were often left out as energy infrastructure was built across the West.

""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.

The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.

The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.

Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.

Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.

But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.

""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a video posted to the agency's YouTube account.

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.

But Pilar Thomas, who practices tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.

""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""

The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.

For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and about 85% of the Hopi's revenue vanished.

The unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%, nearly three times higher than the national average.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.

In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.

Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.

""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""

Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.

"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.

Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""

The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.

"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2Fb0%2Ff8fbbecb40d099875bbcdaffb72a%2F0b6a3014.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:00:25.103631

Trump and DOGE have gutted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which enforces the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Superfund Act, as well as the Department of the Interior, which enforces the Surface Mining Act (for coal), the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and also manages the National Park System. Trump has also fired experienced environmental lawyers and Inspectors General from the EPA, the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Justice Department, and U.S. Attorney's Offices, where these laws are enforced in federal courts. He is making it nearly impossible to implement these laws, thereby allowing industrial and other polluters to damage the environment with impunity. He has also caused the removal of interactive pages from federal websites related to climate change and environmental justice.

In the Department of the Interior, Trump has opened millions of acres of protected public lands and the offshore continental shelf to oil and gas leasing. He recently opened 13 million acres of federal lands to more coal mining and is pushing to restart obsolete, polluting, and expensive coal-fired power plants. His MAGA House and Senate supporters are still trying to legislatively order a massive sell-off of public lands to offset their tax breaks for millionaires. His complicit Supreme Court has recently weakened the standards for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), meaning that there will be less stringent reviews of proposed development projects on Federal Lands.

His minions at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have proposed changing the definition of ""harm"" under the Endangered Species Act to exclude habitat destruction—the primary way in which threatened and endangered species are harmed. His U.S. Forest Service minions have announced a vastly expanded production of timber from National Forests while also cutting the budget for forest firefighters. He has again withdrawn the United States from the international Paris Accord climate treaty and has cut all funding and tax incentives for electric vehicles and solar power. He continues to deny that climate change is happening or caused by human pollution, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and his EPA chief has proposed reversing the “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act that forms the basis for EPA to promulgate rules regulating CO2 and methane in the atmosphere.

In short, the Trump Administration is a disaster for the human and natural environment. It threatens the entire system of environmental and public lands protections that Congress has enacted over the last sixty years. It is madness: Protecting the profits of industry in the short run to guarantee the destruction of the environment in the long run.

The Sierra Club, Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Southern Environmental Law Center, and the Environmental Defense Fund, among others, have filed dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration and have achieved considerable success. For instance, EarthJustice's suit against the USDA for deleting climate data from its website resulted in the USDA restoring the data. A lawsuit by the NRDC led to the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington issuing a preliminary injunction, lifting the Trump administration's unlawful freeze on federal funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. Several courts have ordered the Trump administration to spend money appropriated by Congress for environmental programs and personnel that it had illegally impounded, but the Supreme Court has recently allowed Trump to go forward with many of his firings and personnel cuts.

So, what can you do to help? You can financially support the Sierra Club and the environmental law groups mentioned above in their efforts to thwart Trump's actions. You can write or call your Congressional representatives and respectfully but heartily protest. You can write letters to the editors of newspapers, put statements on your blog posts or social media sites, and show up for public protests. The worst thing you can do is to sit it out and hope the nightmare ends.

Without your activism and that of millions of other Americans, there is no chance of reversing the disaster that Trump is bringing to the American people and the world.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:06.623994

The potential launch comes as the company moves to offset the loss of US federal incentives for electric vehicles.

Sources said the new entry-level Model Y is the vehicle the company hinted at in social media posts over the weekend.

The cheaper variant will drop some features and use less expensive materials to help counterbalance the end of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that ceased this month.

Executives indicated on the company’s latest earnings call that production of the lower-cost model began in June, but the decision was taken to delay scaling up output until after the US phased out the incentives.

Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja and Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering, offered few specifics at the time, before Elon Musk clarified the model in question.

“It’s the Model Y,” Musk said, adding that he would “let the cat out of the bag”.

He continued: “The desire to buy the car is very high, it’s just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it. So, the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

The company reduced costs on the Model Y partly by concentrating on the battery pack and motor, the sources said.

Last week, Tesla reported global deliveries of 497,099 vehicles for the July to September period, a quarterly record.

Tesla does not provide regional breakdowns, but with Europe and China weaker this year, the increase likely reflected stronger US demand.

While the expiry of the tax credits lifted sales ahead of the deadline, the pull-forward could weigh on electric vehicle demand in the coming months.

Musk cautioned in July that the company could face “a few rough quarters” after US incentives end.

According to Kings Research, the global tubular solar collector market was valued at USD 5,450.0 million in 2023 and is projected to expand from USD 5,724.1 million in 2024 to USD 8,394.2 million by 2031, registering a CAGR of 5.62% during the forecast period.

This expansion is supported by rising adoption of solar thermal technologies in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, as well as government-backed incentives for clean energy, advances in hybrid solar systems, and increasing awareness of carbon reduction.

Tubular solar collectors utilize evacuated glass tubes to absorb solar radiation and transfer thermal energy to a heat transfer fluid. A vacuum between the inner and outer tubes reduces heat loss, enhancing efficiency even in low-light and cold-weather conditions. These systems are widely applied for residential heating, commercial water heating, and industrial thermal processes, offering a low-carbon, energy-efficient solution.

Kings Research identifies the following growth accelerators for the tubular solar collector market

Strong Government Incentives and Policy Frameworks

The IEA reports that in 2023, global renewable heat consumption is rising, with solar-thermal use in buildings projected to grow ~40% during 2023–2028. Under the updated Renewable Energy Directive (RED III, 2023), the EU has set a binding target for at least 42.5% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030.

In India, the MNRE’s renewable targets aim for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, reinforcing the country’s push for solar and thermal systems (Source: www.pib.gov.in). In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act extends the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for eligible renewable energy projects (including solar technologies) through at least 2025, aiding deployment of solar thermal and related technologies.

Advancements in Solar Technology

Ongoing innovations such as selective coatings, advanced insulation, automated smart controllers, and hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems are significantly improving efficiency and lowering costs. Hybrid collectors integrating PV and thermal functions are enabling dual energy generation, improving energy independence and space efficiency.

Rising Demand for Hybrid Solar Systems

The integration of tubular solar collectors with PV panels is an emerging trend that enables simultaneous production of electricity and heat. This dual function increases system ROI and makes adoption more appealing for residential and commercial applications.

Commercial & Industrial Sector Adoption The commercial sector accounted for 52% of market share in 2023, driven by demand for energy-efficient heating in offices, hospitals, and hotels. Industrial applications, such as process heating, are also increasingly adopting solar thermal solutions to offset fossil fuel costs and emissions.

Tubular solar collectors offer critical benefits for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors

Operational Efficiency: Low-maintenance systems reduce downtime and enhance long-term reliability.

Cost Savings: Extended equipment life and lower operating costs reduce overall expenditure.

Sustainability: Eco-friendly designs contribute to emissions reduction and compliance with climate policies.

Energy Independence: Hybrid systems and TES integration provide stable energy supply while reducing reliance on grid power.

Regional Outlook

Asia-Pacific: Leading with 36.63% share (USD 1,996.3 million in 2023), driven by large-scale adoption in China, India, and Japan. Favorable policies, rapid industrialization, and off-grid demand strengthen growth, with a projected CAGR of 6.19% (2024–2031).

Europe: Expected CAGR of 5.82%, underpinned by EU carbon-neutrality goals, strong subsidy frameworks, and ongoing technological innovation.

North America: Growth supported by tax credits, rising commercial adoption, and integration into green building certifications (LEED).

Soon, though, it may be out of their hands. A BlackRock-owned private equity firm is set to take over the parent company of central Indiana’s electricity monopoly, AES Indiana.

Indiana and Indianapolis need to work together to stop this.

What are private equity firms?

Private equity firms purchase companies with the intent of selling them for profit. They often cut staffing, equipment and put companies in debt to do so, at the expense of their long-term sustainability.

When most people think of private equity, BlackRock is one of the first firms that comes to mind. It is a multinational investment firm and the largest asset manager in the world.

State Treasurer Daniel Elliott put BlackRock on a watchlist last year and ultimately banned it from managing Indiana’s public retirement funds because of its environmental, social and governance commitments, in an attempt to keep “politics out of investments.” ESG commitments include things like a corporation's social mission or cultural agenda that it can't necessarily monetize.

A spokesperson for Elliott declined to comment on the sale.

BlackRock has also invested in companies involved in human rights violations in China, according to the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.

In purchasing a public utility, private equity firms like BlackRock could pass on debt to consumers and lower service quality to extract profit with no consequences, as consumers have no alternatives.

These firms likely see a route to quick profits selling electricity to data centers, fueled by an economy high on artificial intelligence and subsidized by massive state tax breaks.

Blackstone, another private equity firm, bought almost 20% of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. LLC last year. NIPSCO then planned several solar farms and other infrastructure investments and passed costs onto consumers. It is also planning additional natural gas plants to power data centers.

The result was the highest jump in electricity prices of any utility in Indiana over the last year, 26%. For some customers, that meant an increase of $50 per month.

Indiana should ban sale of public utilities to private equity

State Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, who authored a law banning Indiana’s public retirement system from investing in China, opposes the sale of AES Indiana to a firm controlled by BlackRock.

“BlackRock's focus on short-term profits contradicts the long-term interests of Hoosier ratepayers who rely on stable and affordable energy,” Garten told me. “By prioritizing their ESG beliefs over the financial well-being of our communities, BlackRock threatens to undermine our energy independence and economic stability.”

“It is vital that we protect the interests of Indiana residents by opposing this acquisition and ensuring that our utility companies remain accountable to those they serve, rather than to the ideological pursuits of distant investors,” he added.

There is very little that Indiana can do to stop the merger, however, said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizen’s Action Coalition.

“By choice, the state has virtually no authority,” he said, citing a decision by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on a recent merger of two utilities, in which it claimed to have no “approval jurisdiction” over the transaction.

State legislators would likely have to enact a law during the next legislative session to do anything about it.

Such legislation could do several things. It could give the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission “approval jurisdiction” over purchases of public utilities. Then it could ban private equity companies from buying a controlling stake in Indiana’s public utilities. It could also force private equity companies that already own a controlling stake to sell their stock to a municipality or another local owner, ideally a nonprofit.

Indianapolis should buy AES Indiana

If the state does not take action, Indianapolis could offer to buy AES Indiana.

Almost 50 years ago, the city was granted the authority to buy public utilities using revenue bonds, a tool frequently used to fund multimillion-dollar school improvements.

Indianapolis last exercised this right in 2002 with the purchase of the Indianapolis Water Company for $515 million. The city contracted with another company to manage the utility until selling it to Citizens Energy, a nonprofit, public charitable trust, in 2011.

The City-County Council could grant Mayor Joe Hogsett the authority to strike a deal to purchase AES Indiana. It would be an excellent way for the Mayor to begin to fix his public image during a scandal-filled third term.

Jesse Brown, an east-side City-County Council Democrat, supported the idea after I asked him about it.

“Indianapolis should purchase AES Indiana and run it ourselves,” he said on X, after I showed him the portion of Indiana code that allows the city to do so. “If we can use revenue bonds to finance a hotel, why not use those bonds to finance an electric utility? Guaranteed return on equity is obviously attractive to shareholders.”

Republican Councilor Michael-Paul Hart told me the idea was “worth exploring."" He later called it “a massive concept that would restore local control of our power grid.” He clarified in his newsletter, though, he wasn’t “exploring that path right now.”

Josh Bain, another Republican, told me he was open to the idea under one condition.

“I would certainly entertain the idea of Indianapolis purchasing AES, but only if the end goal is to create a true ratepayer-owned cooperative,” he told me. “I don’t trust the Hogsett administration to properly run a utility company, and the last thing we need is more government mismanagement.

“If we’re serious about this, it needs to be owned and operated by the people who pay the bills — not by city hall,” he added.

Hogsett could strike a deal with AES

To be fair, the city had an advantage in 2002 due to an ordinance from 1870 that gave it first option to purchase of the water utility. The state, however, could end its ban on municipalities forcing public utilities to sell their property and give them essentially the same power now.

It's unclear what a fair price might look like to purchase the company, though.

""The city of Indianapolis is in a better position to discuss its own processes, including views with respect to valuations,"" an AES Indiana spokesperson told me.

When AES bought Indianapolis Power and Light Co. in 2000, the transaction valued IPL much higher than AES Indiana is today. But AES Corp.'s ownership structure is more complex. While AES Corp. holds the controlling stake in AES Indiana, it owns only 82.35% of the total stock.

AES Indiana's electricity infrastructure is worth more than $5.4 billion, but much of it is financed through debt. AES Indiana's yearly revenue is around $1.6 billion. Those two points, along with AES Indiana's existing debt obligations, would likely be the key factors in determining the final purchase price. This would be paid for out of the utility's yearly operating revenue over time using bonds.

Regardless of what that final number is, it would likely be a small price to pay to save our public utility from being chopped up and sold for parts.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/03/PIND/82792770007-040325-storms-carmel-kmw-024.JPG?crop=3599,2026,x0,y391&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-07 08:03:00.069849

“Boy, we sure hate what they’re doing to our country,” goes the thinking that one often hears expressed, “but we wish that our side could stop pussyfooting around and learn a thing or two from the right about doing what it takes to win!”

In some ways at least, it’s an understandable sentiment. Over the last several years, progressives have watched in horror as a determined minority movement has seized control of and radicalized the nation’s laws and governmental institutions in unprecedented ways. In numerous areas – public and higher education, personal bodily autonomy, the role and rights of corporations and workers, racial and gender equality, the distribution of the nation’s wealth, separation of church and state, gun ownership, combating the climate crisis, and even America’s role in the world – the right has succeeded in overturning decades of slow but mostly steady progress and imposing a series of dramatic policy 180’s.

What’s more, to add to the frustration, the change in no way reflects any kind of significant shift in public opinion or popular values.

Rather, like so many past authoritarian movements that seized upon narrow electoral victories and, either by hook or crook, converted them into massive power shifts and policy sea changes, modern American conservatives have used passion, large doses of cynical pragmatism and an unapologetic willingness to shatter legal and societal norms to secure their objectives.

Think about it – the proof of this reality is in the numbers. Donald Trump lost the popular vote in two of the last three national elections and won less than 50% of the vote in his 2024 victory. Congress has been divided by the narrowest of margins for years. In North Carolina, registered Democrats still slightly outnumber registered Republicans and as multiple razor-thin Supreme Court races demonstrate, it remains a deeply “purple” state.

If ever there was a time in which public attitudes would seem to demand divided, middle ground government, this is it.

Instead, of course, we have the opposite. Rather than generally staying the course or pursuing incremental change, Republicans in Washington, DC and several states like North Carolina have repeatedly swung for the fences and moved with all the speed they can muster to roll back past progressive wins and lock in unpopular, ultra-right policies – like slashing taxes on the rich, disempowering workers, undermining reproductive freedom, abandoning efforts to combat climate change and militarizing law enforcement.

Will they succeed in effecting a lasting overhaul of American society?

Maybe.

While it’s true that many, if not most, hard right and authoritarian regimes in modern times have eventually foundered, Trump and company have taken some steps – perhaps most notably in the courts – that will make rooting out some of their changes quite difficult.

That said, a recent public opinion poll in North Carolina helps shine a light on what could be an important Achilles’ Heel.

The issue is gerrymandering – the drawing of political maps to rig elections for partisan purposes.

As has been well-publicized, Republicans have been moving aggressively at Trump’s specific direction of late to further gerrymander already rigged electoral maps in a handful of states they already control in hopes of retaining their narrow control of the U.S. House in the 2026 elections. This includes North Carolina, where it appears Republican legislative leaders are likely to pass legislation later this month that would eliminate chances for Democrats to prevail in the First Congressional District – a region in the state’s east that takes in most of the so-called “Black Belt,” currently represented by Democrat Don Davis.

If this effort succeeds – and some reports indicate that Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger has pledged to do the deed in exchange for a Trump endorsement in his 2026 GOP primary, although Berger has denied this — the state’s already rigged U.S. House map would shift from 10-4 Republican to 11-3.

As a new poll conducted by a GOP polling firm and released by the good government nonprofit Common Cause demonstrates convincingly, however, such a move will be enormously unpopular. The poll found that 84% of voters – including 78% of unaffiliated voters and 65% of Republicans – said gerrymandering maps for partisan advantage is “never acceptable.” Two-thirds of GOP leaders said the practice should be illegal and nearly half conceded that the current already rigged maps were likely unfairly drawn.

Could this remarkable consensus in public opinion ultimately help give rise to a shift in attitudes and behavior among enough voters (and help anger enough progressives) to help swing upcoming elections against Trump and set the nation on a different path? In such closely divided times, it certainly seems possible.

Whatever the case, the blatant and desperate nature of the scheme provides a strong indication that, like many other authoritarian fear-dependent regimes down through human history, the Trump movement is grappling with some significant fears of its own.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Redistricting-Daniel.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 05:58:18.720933

For nearly a century, the Kelley’s Falls Dam in Manchester, New Hampshire, generated as much as 2,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. When the small hydroelectric station in a downtown park came up for relicensing in 2022, its owners faced what many dam operators now expect when trying to extend the lifespan of these power generators: strict requirements that would force them to spend millions on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit. Instead, Green Mountain Power made a choice that has become common among hydroelectric operators. The utility simply surrendered its licenses.

Last year, the plant shut down.

Nearly 450 hydroelectric stations totaling more than 16 gigawatts of generating capacity are scheduled for relicensing across the United States over the next decade. That’s roughly 40% of the nonfederal fleet (the government owns about half the hydropower stations in the U.S.). The country is now on the verge of a major shift in hydropower. The facilities could be relicensed to supply the booming demand for electricity to power everything from data centers to aluminum smelters. Tech and industrial giants could even help pay for the costly relicensing process with deals like the record-setting $3 billion contract Google inked with hydropower operator Brookfield Asset Management in July for up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower. Or, as has been happening for years, the U.S. could continue to lose gigawatts of power as hydroelectric facilities shut down rather than absorb the high costs of relicensing — especially with cheaper competition from gas, wind, and solar.

The fleet of dams that helped electrify the nation starting in the late 1800s provides the second-largest share of the country’s renewable power after wind, and by far its most firm. But the average age of U.S. dams is 65 years, meaning the bulk of the fleet wasn’t built with newfangled infrastructure to enable unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife. As seen in New Hampshire, the cost of upgrading facilities to allow for that passage can soar into the tens of millions of dollars — on top of the expense of upgrading custom-built equipment for each plant. Complicating matters further, after decades of decline in the hydropower sector, the manufacturing muscle for turbines and other hardware that make a dam work has largely atrophied in the U.S.

The relicensing waiting game

The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920 to regulate hydroelectric facilities — does not give any single agency full authority over hydropower the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has over atomic energy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the key permits on the national level, but other agencies also play a role. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, may require a National Environmental Policy Act review to examine a dam’s effects on a specific fish species, a process that involves assessing multiple spawning cycles. And once that’s done for salmon, the agency may undertake yet another multiyear study on trout. FERC, meanwhile, can’t issue its licenses until state agencies overseeing waterways approve permits. That alone can eat up years.

As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)

“It takes longer to relicense an existing hydro facility than a new nuclear facility,” said Malcolm Woolf, the National Hydropower Association’s chief executive. ​“It takes just 18 months to get a new license for a nuclear plant.”

With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.

“This is major infrastructure. These facilities cost billions of dollars,” Woolf said. ​“They’re like bridges and roads. They get a license for 50 years. The state agencies view [the relicensing process] as an opportunity to extract concessions from what they view as a deep pocket.”

At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.

“One … regulator was requiring a facility to pay for a feral-pig-eradication program,” Woolf said.

“In the 1970s, maybe the industry was a deep pocket,” he added. ​“But now, with the low cost of other fuels like wind and solar and gas, it’s driving these facilities to bankruptcy and to surrender licenses.”

The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.

In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license. In Maryland, the Conowingo Dam’s relicensing process has also stretched on for two decades. In Massachusetts, the Northfield Mountain plant is in the middle of a 15-year permitting slog.

To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ​“But if they don’t have a long-term license,” Woolf warned, ​“they’re not about to invest millions in upgrades.”

One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80% of the plant’s market value into upgrades like new turbines or panels, making them eligible for bigger federal write-offs. In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department granted hydroelectric facilities the same flexibility.

But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

“The question in the hydropower industry was, if you think of the Hoover Dam, is it 80% of the electric generating equipment? Or 80% of the whole Hoover Dam and the reservoir? So that’s what the Treasury clarified,” Woolf said. ​“It’s 80% of the electric generating equipment. So if you replace a 50-year-old generator with a new generator, you’re going to satisfy that.”

While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1 executive orders on energy. In July, Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, preserving hydropower’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years. If a hydro project is built in a designated ​“energy community” and uses domestically manufactured equipment, the tax credit can cover as much as half the investment.

A fishy problem

Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as half the biomass in rivers across the country — migrate downstream to spawn as breeding-age adults.

One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.

“Fish-passage solutions can be extraordinarily expensive,” said Jennifer Garson, the former director of the Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. ​“The problem is the burden falls completely on hydropower operators to make these upgrades.”

The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019, the startup Natel Energy, which designs fish-safe hydropower turbines, installed its pilot project in Maine, then another in Oregon the following year. Natel’s technology — based on thicker blades that don’t sever fish as they move through the dam — was validated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The company won $9 million from the Energy Department to scale up its supply chain.

While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40 years old, CEO Gia Schneider said, the new Natel units produce more electricity per spin on average.

“They’re going to modernize, get fish-safe turbines that will safely pass eel, salmon, and herring that need to go through the plant, and they’ll get 5% more energy,” Schneider said.

Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency.

“At another plant where we’re working on the design, the turbines are pretty young – only installed 10 years ago,” she said. ​“There, we’re going to get maybe 0.2% less energy out.”

On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 5% to 15%.

“You’re losing a lot more from these bolt-on solutions,” she said. ​“At the end of the day, if you get 0.2% less on the turbine side, … on the whole-plant level, you’re coming out ahead.”

Old hydropower, new opportunities

At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.

Just 3% of the nation’s 80,000 dams generate electricity. In 2012, an Energy Department report found that the U.S. could add 12 gigawatts of new power by overhauling those facilities to produce electricity. More than a decade later, ​“none of it was built,” Woolf said.

There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.

And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22-year low last year after below-average snowfall, according to analysis by the Energy Information Administration. Yet other parts of the U.S., such as the Northeast, are getting wetter as the planet heats up.

While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China started construction on what will, upon completion, be the world’s largest power station, a giant hydroelectric facility in Tibet. Last month, Brazil held its first auctions for new small- and medium-size dams with hopes of turning $1 billion in investments into more hydroelectricity. And Ethiopia just opened its megadam project meant to alleviate electricity issues in the country, despite pushback from Egyptians who say the facility could negatively impact the flow of water on the Nile.

The U.S. could get in on the game, or at least work to clear away hurdles preventing the country from taking advantage of the infrastructure that already exists. As the Trump administration looks to re-shore heavy industry through tariffs, Woolf said, ​“hydropower is a great resource for colocating manufacturing because you’ve got energy infrastructure and you’re typically in fairly rural areas where land is less expensive.” For data centers, reservoirs could offer the additional service of providing water for cooling hot computer servers, along with electricity. And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power. These plants could, in theory, play that role again as new demand for domestically produced aluminum — to manufacture electric vehicles and clean-energy equipment — puts strain on the remaining six smelters.

“We know we’ve got load growth. We know we’ve got grid variability from renewables and extreme weather. The flexibility of hydropower offers clean, firm generation that is unique,” Woolf said. ​“At the same time — through quirk of history — we’ve got so much of the fleet at relicensing and at risk of surrendering permits. This could be an amazing opportunity.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydropower-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 11:00:54.034602

On a warm, sunny Saturday morning in late September, The Corner Farmers Market in Greensboro’s Lindley Park neighborhood was an inviting place to be. Throngs of people — some with kids or dogs in tow — drifted from one tent to the next, browsing tables filled with fresh vegetables, baked goods, cut flowers and handmade crafts.

Beyond the friendly atmosphere and fresh offerings, the market offers another important benefit: shoppers who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits can not only use them here — they can get double their value.

SNAP participants can visit the manager’s booth to swipe their benefits card, and the market matches the amount — up to $50 — by issuing tokens that can be used to purchase any SNAP-eligible food, market manager Kathy Newsom said.

“They can buy meat, eggs, any sorts of produce [or] prepared foods if they’re cold,” Newsom said.

While the U.S. Department of Agriculture reimburses the amount spent through SNAP, Corner Market must raise separate funds — through grants, community donations and frequent fundraisers — to cover the cost of the match, Newsom said.

“We have to raise about $50,000 a year to match the amount of demand that comes into our market.”

Market regular Dianne, 67, who preferred to use only her first name, said she appreciates that the market offers a discreet, respectful way for SNAP users to shop without stigma.

“Shopping at the market is a win for all of us,” she said. “We need the vendors, and the vendors need us.”

But cuts to the SNAP program embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by Congress threaten to jeopardize access to farmers markets for millions of Americans like Diane. In 2024, nearly 42 million people — about 12 percent of the U.S. population — received SNAP benefits each month, according to USDA data.

Because of the OBBBA, those benefits are due to shrink, with consumers and farmers taking the hits.

Mixed messages

As concerns mount about the scheduled program cuts, U.S. Health and Human Services Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to “Make America Healthy Again.”

A statement on the HHS website reads: “Under the leadership of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., HHS is taking bold, decisive action to reform America’s food, health, and scientific systems to identify the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

Yet in September, the USDA announced it would discontinue its annual Household Food Security Reports, also known as the Food Insecurity Survey — the tool used to measure how many U.S. households struggle to put food on the table. Without the survey, it’ll be hard to track how well people are doing in getting access to healthy food.

SNAP is a key federal tool for reducing food insecurity. Without it, millions of Americans would be at greater risk of hunger or be forced to eat cheaper, lower-quality food.

In North Carolina, more than 1.4 million people — across more than 700,000 households — receive SNAP benefits each month. More than 600,000 children, 159,000 adults over 65 and more than 46,000 North Carolina veterans rely on SNAP, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

In response to the federal government shutdown, the state health department assured residents that October SNAP benefits would not be affected. The agency encouraged households to continue applying for services and said it will post updates as new information becomes available from the USDA. Those with additional questions are urged to contact their local county department of social services, according to information provided on the agency’s webpage.

Mutual benefits

Maggie Funkhouser, the North Carolina Farmers Market Network program coordinator, emphasized the dual purpose of accepting SNAP benefits at farmers markets: expanding food access and supporting the local farm economy.

“[We] estimate that SNAP incentives make up about 20 percent of total sales at farmers markets — and 20 percent is huge,” Funkhouser said.

“If incentives get folks into that market to be able to buy highly nutritious, fresh, culturally relevant food — to support our farmers [and] connect them with our consumers who use SNAP — that’s the goal,” she said.

“We’re able to accept SNAP through the farmers market,” said Brittany Peters, who with her partner, Richard Raggi, operates Sun and Soil Farm in Madison, about 25 miles from Greensboro. The couple sell fruits, vegetables and flowers at the Corner Market.

“It’s a huge deal, because it makes our food more accessible to everybody,” Peters said.

That kind of accessibility — and the income it generates — is especially valuable for small farms, many of which operate on tight margins and face limited funding options.

The support is essential, said Roland McReynolds, executive director of Carolina Farm Stewardship Association, a nonprofit that advocates for sustainable, local and organic food systems. He explained that the federal government — primarily through the USDA and the farm bill that’s reauthorized every few years — has historically provided the main safety net for U.S. agriculture. State governments, including North Carolina, rarely step into this role, he said, and when they do, it’s typically on an emergency basis, such as providing disaster relief after Hurricane Helene.

With growing budget pressures from programs like Medicaid and SNAP, most states are unlikely to fully absorb the burden if federal support declines.

Still, McReynolds said, the state can play a vital role in the event of future SNAP cuts.

“If the state can step in to provide funding for SNAP Double Up Bucks programs — [that] will absolutely be important for helping a lot of small farms stabilize their revenue into next year,” he said.

In addition, in some parts of the state where the now-defunct Healthy Opportunities Pilot was buying produce from local farms to provide to Medicaid recipients, growers will be losing another revenue stream.

“In the Helene-impacted part of the state, there are a lot of farmers who got hit really hard last year,” McReynolds added. “They’re trying to make it this year, but when they run their numbers at the end of this year, we may be looking at a significant number of farmers who don’t come back for next year’s growing season.”

Uncertainty going forward

In response to questions about how North Carolina will support the more than 1 million residents who rely on monthly SNAP benefits, DHHS explained in an email that starting October 2026, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes provisions that would significantly reduce federal reimbursement rates to states for administering SNAP. That shift will force North Carolina’s 100 counties, which handle SNAP applications and eligibility, to absorb a greater share of administrative costs.

“NCDHHS will continue to work with county partners to drive down error rates, which determine the state cost share amount,” a department spokesperson said in an email. “Despite these challenges, the mission of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services remains unchanged — we will continue to work to improve the health and well-being of all North Carolinians.”

With the federal government shut down, combined with SNAP funding under pressure, questions persist about the future of SNAP — and what could happen to access to fresh produce at places like the Corner Farmers Market.

Reflecting on her experience shopping at the Corner Farmers Market, Diane said it’s her “happy place.”

Operational since August, the facility aims to strengthen grid reliability in the Houston area, where capacity demand is sharply increasing.

Located approximately 40 kilometres south of downtown Houston, the project is based on Tesla Inc.’s Megapack 2 XL technology, manufactured in California. The two-hour duration facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment-grade off-taker, ensuring stable long-term revenue.

Structured financing to accelerate deployment

The project’s financing was led by Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (Nord/LB) and MUFG Bank, acting as co-lead arrangers. The structure includes a tax equity bridge loan, construction-to-term loan, and letters of credit. A traditional tax equity partnership was also used, reflecting a combination of debt and federal incentive structures to speed up the facility’s deployment.

Nightpeak Energy submitted Bocanova Power’s interconnection request in mid-2023. Two years later, the facility is operational, demonstrating the company’s ability to quickly deliver complex energy infrastructure.

Strategy focused on dispatchable capacity expansion

Founded in 2022, Nightpeak Energy currently operates 240 MW of combined energy storage and natural gas generation capacity. The company is focused on Texas and the Western United States, where the growth of intermittent renewable energy has created a critical need for flexible assets capable of responding to grid fluctuations.

This focus also addresses rising electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centres and industrial sites. Nightpeak Energy executives highlight the urgency of deploying dispatchable resources to meet growing demand and ensure grid stability across key U.S. markets.

Financial partners’ role in project development

MUFG Bank, administrative agent for the financing, stated that the project demonstrates how international banks can support local energy infrastructure while contributing to regional economic growth. Nord/LB also played a key role in structuring the financing, enabling the rapid deployment of battery storage capacity in a strategic Texas location.

Nightpeak Energy is continuing to expand its portfolio of storage and generation projects, with additional infrastructure planned to meet grid needs in Texas and the Western U.S.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/en_114051047540-1.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:08:51.107215

The research firm said that by 2030, China’s offshore wind sector will account for 45% of the world’s cumulative capacity, underlining its growing dominance as the United States scales back renewable investment.

Rystad noted that unfavourable economic and policy conditions in the US — including stop-work orders, reduced tax incentives and inflationary pressures — have slowed domestic project development and diverted capital flows to Europe and Asia.

Gaul",,,,,https://undark.org/2025/10/07/epa-greenhouse-gas-data/,"This data is also the backbone of much of international U.S. climate policy: Collection of greenhouse gas emissions data is mandated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which undergirds the Paris Agreement.
In recent years, various groups have stepped up to the table to help calculate greenhouse gas emissions from sources both in the U.S. and nationwide.

There’s a dark timing, says cofounder Gavin McCormick, in having the EPA move to end the GHGRP after Climate TRACE has built its models relying so heavily on EPA data.
Still, all experts WIRED spoke to stressed that ending GHGRP data collection would severely hobble U.S. efforts to measure and combat greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how good the non-federal options are.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced last month that it would stop making polluting companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to it, eliminating a crucial tool the U.S. uses to track emissions and form climate policy. Climate NGOs say their work could help plug some of the data gap, but they and other experts fear the EPA’s work can’t be fully matched.

This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

“I don’t think this system can be fully replaced,” says Joseph Goffman, the former assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. “I think it could be approximated — but it’s going to take time.”

The Clean Air Act requires states to collect data on local pollution levels, which states then turn over to the federal government. For the past 15 years, the EPA has also collected data on carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases from sources around the country that emit over a certain threshold of emissions. This program is known as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, and “is really the backbone of the air quality reporting system in the United States,” says Kevin Gurney, a professor of atmospheric science at Northern Arizona University.

Like a myriad of other data-collection processes that have been stalled or halted since the start of this year, the Trump administration has put this program in the crosshairs. In March, the EPA announced it would be reconsidering the GHGRP program entirely. In September, the agency trotted out a proposed rule to eliminate reporting obligations from sources ranging from power plants to oil and gas refineries to chemical facilities — all major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. (The agency claims that rolling back the GHGRP will save $2.4 billion in regulatory costs, and that the program is “nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.”)

Joseph says shutting down this program hamstrings “the government’s basic practical capacity to formulate climate policy.” Understanding how new emissions-reduction technologies are working, or surveying which industries are decarbonizing and which are not, “is extremely hard to do if you don’t have this data.”

Data collected by the GHGRP, which is publicly available, underpins much of federal climate policy: Understanding which sectors are contributing which kinds of emissions is the first step in forming strategies to draw those emissions down. This data is also the backbone of much of international U.S. climate policy: Collection of greenhouse gas emissions data is mandated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which undergirds the Paris Agreement. (While the U.S. exited the Paris Agreement for the second time on the first day of Trump’s second term, it remains — tenuously — a part of the UNFCCC.) Data collected by the GHGRP is also crucial to state and local climate policies, helping policymakers outside the federal government take stock of local pollution, form emissions-reductions goals, and track progress on bringing down emissions.

There’s some hope that nongovernmental actors could help. In recent years, various groups have stepped up to the table to help calculate greenhouse gas emissions from sources both in the U.S. and nationwide. These groups use a mix of federal, state, industry, and private data — from oil and gas industry databases to public and private satellites to federal data like what the EPA provides — to create tools that help policymakers and the public understand where greenhouse gas emissions are coming from, and how they impact people in various ways. Technology has also grown leaps and bounds, too, as artificial intelligence models are getting more advanced at both tracking and modeling emissions from different sources.

In the days since the EPA’s announcement, groups collecting and modeling emissions data say that they are fielding calls from various stakeholders trying to figure out solutions if the EPA revokes the program. Goffman, who left the EPA at the start of this year, says that there are staff within the agency looking to “connect or become part of university efforts” to continue data collection.

One of the most high-profile efforts in nongovernmental emissions modeling is a coalition called Climate TRACE, which was founded in 2019, following a donation from Google, to observe global emissions using satellites. The group, which has since grown to more than 100 collaborating organizations, has developed a host of AI models that they pair with data from various sources to track and model emissions from around the world.

There’s a dark timing, says cofounder Gavin McCormick, in having the EPA move to end the GHGRP after Climate TRACE has built its models relying so heavily on EPA data. “We started this project on the thesis that America has the world’s best emissions monitoring, and other countries could reduce emissions faster if they got up to the same quality as America,” McCormick says. “We just spent five years building this AI system to try to make it possible for other countries to have an approximation of the same system America has.”

It’s not just the climate-conscious who are worried about the future of this data: There’s significant industry interest in continuing to collect national data on greenhouse gas emissions. Just because the U.S. government is no longer invested in tracking climate change doesn’t mean the rest of the world is on board. Oil and gas companies with facilities in the U.S., for instance, still have a financial interest to keep track of their emissions if they’re selling to other markets — like Europe, which is beginning to impose strict methane requirements on gas imported into the bloc.

“Our phones have been blowing up over the last ten days or so, from people saying, ‘Should we start reporting to you now? You’re not an official source, but you’re the closest thing there is,’” says McCormick. “It’s not obvious to me that we are the right vehicle for that. But there are very clear business interests in why companies would want to continue reporting even though they don’t have to.”

Private industry data could also be used to help track greenhouse gas emissions — and even covers some emissions that aren’t captured in the EPA data. The Rocky Mountain Institute, for instance, a nonprofit that works on market-based climate solutions, runs an index based on private industry data that tracks emissions from across the oil and gas production cycle. (RMI is part of the Climate TRACE coalition.) This private data enables this index to have insights into emissions from the industry that the GHGRP may have missed or undercalculated — including calculating emissions from sources that don’t meet the cutoff for reporting.

Still, all experts WIRED spoke to stressed that ending GHGRP data collection would severely hobble U.S. efforts to measure and combat greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how good the non-federal options are. There’s a myriad of difficulties that face any organization that tries to take on this monumental task.

“If the EPA stopped requiring this, it’s entirely possible that states will continue to do it,” says Gurney. But, he says, “there is no [other] central warehouse to do the collating. Fifty entities turning in data files, which are massively complex, is just a huge endeavor. The EPA plays such an important role as this kind of data arbiter, ensuring that it’s all complying with standardization. That’s key for the rest of us, frankly, to not have to do that ourselves, which would be pretty much a prohibitive barrier for us to be able to make sense of that amount of data.”

There are many different ways to calculate emissions; the techniques used to collect and model data can also differ between different organizations and experts. Gurney, for instance, has been a vocal critic of the way Climate TRACE designs its models. The EPA’s pollution reporting requirements, meanwhile, are also backed by law: “A nongovernmental entity really can’t require that,” Goffman says.

There’s also an open question of whether nongovernmental estimates could hold up legally, especially if a policy formed using these estimates is challenged in court. In Louisiana, a law passed last year seriously restricts the ability of communities to use low-cost emissions-monitoring devices to track air quality and bring complaints or lawsuits about emissions violations; air monitoring must now be solely done by EPA-approved tools. (Groups who advocate for communities living near oil and gas facilities filed a lawsuit in May, saying that the tools are prohibitively expensive for local advocates and claiming the law is a “blatant violation of the free speech rights of community members to use their own independent air pollution monitoring to raise alarms about deadly chemicals being released into their own homes and schools.”)

That law “really drove home to me that this is only partly a scientific and do-you-have-the-data question, and partly an are-you-legally-allowed-to-use-that-dataset question,” says McCormick.

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

Germany’s ruling coalition confirmed it will extend a tax exemption for new electric vehicles as part of a broader effort to support the nation’s key car industry in the transition to more climate-friendly technologies.

Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will present a draft law soon which will keep the existing tax exemption for EVs in place until 2035, Maximilian Kall, a finance ministry spokesman, said Oct. 6 at a regular government news conference in Berlin.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a member of the Social Democrat Party who is also the vice chancellor, told dpa news agency.

The coalition accord agreed on by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and Klingbeil’s SPD included the pledge to extend the incentive to 2035, and the confirmation comes ahead of a planned “car summit” Oct. 9 between government officials, auto executives and labor representatives.

The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.

Announcements last month that Volkswagen AG was paring back production and Robert Bosch GmbH slashing 13,000 jobs were the latest evidence of how the auto industry’s decline is rippling through Europe’s biggest economy.

Car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG followed last week by saying it planned to eliminate 7,600 positions at its electrified drivetrain division as it steps up its restructuring efforts to deal with poor demand.

“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” Klingbeil said. “We want the best cars to continue to be made in Germany.”

Extending the EV exemption is expected to cost the federal government approximately 600 million euros ($703 million) in lost revenue through 2029, Kall told reporters.

As part of his government’s effort to aid the car sector, Merz last month urged the European Union to give up its 2035 deadline to effectively ban combustion engines and instead allow the industry to pursue a softer path to climate neutrality.

“We haven’t agreed on a joint position on the matter within the coalition, but I hope that this will happen soon,” Merz said in a television interview with n-tv broadcaster.

“I don’t want Germany to be among the member states that stick to this wrong ban.”

Some members of Klingbeil’s SPD, including Environment Minister Carsten Schneider, are unhappy with the move, but the party is expected to signal its backing later this week, with the issue set to be discussed at regular coalition talks Oct. 8 in Berlin.

Olaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony whose government is VW’s second-biggest shareholder, said last week the priority should be to protect jobs.

“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ. “Combustion engines, especially plug-in hybrids and vehicles with range extenders, must continue to be permitted beyond 2035, and alternative fuels must also be included.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-10/Germany-1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 04:58:34.493561

""These are big packages that we put together to help keep Minnesota energy effective, efficient, and have fewer disruptions and keep costs down for ratepayers,"" Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) said.
The largest terminated grant in Minnesota involves a $464 million award to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, related to upgrading the electrical transmission lines across seven Midwestern states.
The other cancellations involve millions of dollars in reductions to major power companies in Minnesota, such as Minnesota Power in Duluth that serves northeastern Minnesota, Otter Tail Power, Cummins Electrified Power and Native Sun Community Power Development for tribal communities.
The $50 million grant termination associated with Minnesota Power and ALLETE, Inc., was part of a broader modernization project.","SAINT PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota stands to lose more than $600 million in federal energy grants after the Trump administration terminated about a dozen projects connected to the state, according to lists provided by the U.S. Department of Energy and a member of Minnesota's Congressional delegation.

Shortly after the government shutdown began last week, the Department of Energy announced the cuts in Minnesota and a handful of other largely Democratic states, totaling more than $7.5 billion. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has denied that the program cancellations had anything to do with the shutdown and said the agency reviewed the merits of the projects for months.

""A team of seven or eight people have evaluated over 2,400 projects just on business conditions, whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not,"" Wright said. ""So no, I mean timing of announcements, I don't control that always. But these decisions are made all in the Energy Department, all based on facts.""

Democrats, meanwhile, have widely viewed the grant terminations as retribution for the shutdown, given the concentration in blue states. The cancelled projects are largely, though not exclusively, focused on issues around climate change, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

""These are big packages that we put together to help keep Minnesota energy effective, efficient, and have fewer disruptions and keep costs down for ratepayers,"" Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) said. ""This is being punitive, this is being harmful, this, in my opinion, almost bears to be childish.""

The largest terminated grant in Minnesota involves a $464 million award to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, related to upgrading the electrical transmission lines across seven Midwestern states. A Commerce spokesperson said Monday that the department still has not been formally notified about the cancellation, but last week, the agency argued the cuts could be potentially illegal if true.

The other cancellations involve millions of dollars in reductions to major power companies in Minnesota, such as Minnesota Power in Duluth that serves northeastern Minnesota, Otter Tail Power, Cummins Electrified Power and Native Sun Community Power Development for tribal communities.

The $50 million grant termination associated with Minnesota Power and ALLETE, Inc., was part of a broader modernization project. DFL State Sen. Grant Hauschild said the state had already come forward with $25 million in matching grant money for that project.

""These are competitive, merit-based grants at the federal level that we were going toward clean energy infrastructure,"" Hauschild said, ""toward our energy grid, making sure we have the power we need.""

The list of terminated projects also includes initiatives such as an American Lung Association car-sharing program for the east side of St. Paul.

""That project, called Greater East Side Expansion, was designed to empower East Side Saint Paul residents to determine how carshare can improve access to jobs, shopping, and healthcare, while also reducing air pollution,"" the American Lung Association wrote in a statement to KARE 11. ""This DOE announcement is a definite setback to this work, although we are still moving forward on other work to expand the carshare network on the East Side of Saint Paul.""

Another significant project on the list of terminations includes $70 million for Xcel Energy, involving a battery project in Colorado and Minnesota to store renewable energy. The Minnesota plant associated with that project is based in Becker, which falls in Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer's district.

Emmer, who also serves in House leadership as Majority Whip, said on a press call with local media last week that Democrats were to blame for the shutdown. He said he had not spoken with the U.S. Department of Energy about the termination of the Xcel funding in his district.

""The battery project in Becker, why would I be talking to them?"" Emmer said. ""I need to be talking to Amy (Klobuchar) and Tina (Smith) and Chuck Schumer and telling them, knock it off.""

In an interview, Senator Smith responded by saying that ""it is the Republican administration that cancelled these grants.""

""So I don't know how you could blame Democrats, who are not doing any of this,"" Smith said. ""What I would say to Rep. Emmer is, I am fighting to get Congress to act to stop a massive increase in health insurance premiums.""",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/e4615ec2-7811-402a-943a-3125cd0593fe/20251006T225038/e4615ec2-7811-402a-943a-3125cd0593fe_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 02:59:30.490786

Nuclear energy has emerged as a top energy priority in the U.S., with significant investments and ambitious timelines for achieving criticality.

The Department of Energy announced its Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in June, fast-tracking 11 projects with a goal launch date of July 4 for at least three of the plans.

American energy startup Aalo Atomics was tapped for the initiative. It's constructing a facility, Aalo-X, adjacent to the ​​Idaho National Laboratory Materials and Fuels Complex in Idaho Falls.

Aalo Atomics' experimental extra modular nuclear reactor is based on advanced nuclear reactors known as small modular reactors. Aalo looks to take the concept further, expanding upon SMRs to develop a reactor that is more flexible and easily deployable.

Aalo Atomics CEO Matt Loszak said the startup had power-hungry data centers in mind when developing Aalo-X's XMR.

""We believe that to address today's massive data center market demand, another category of nuclear reactor is needed, one that blends the benefit of the factory manufacturing of microreactors, the power levels of SMRs, and the economic targets of a large reactor,"" he explained.

As cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels go, nuclear energy has long had something of an image problem.

This is partly due to high-profile nuclear incidents in the 1970s and 1980s, but experts say much of that distrust was based on feelings, not facts — and the technology has come a long way in the intervening decades.

It's true that despite rapid advancements and support from tech titans such as Bill Gates, nuclear energy has its cons. The Union of Concerned Scientists took a balanced yet cautious stance on advanced nuclear energy in 2021, outlining both sides.

Nuclear power generates waste that must be managed properly, and facilities remain ""vulnerable to catastrophic accidents and sabotage,"" the former of which is sometimes unavoidable. The UCS also expressed concerns that nuclear plants could be repurposed to build destructive weapons.

However, in contrast to planet-warming dirty fuels, nuclear remains a low-carbon source of energy, one that provides nearly 20% of the country's electricity. If progress continues, nuclear power could soon play a more significant role in America's energy supply.

""​​Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from founding to fission in less than three years — a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,"" Loszak told Interesting Engineering.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MoIpEjjoLswYTGyiXGObMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/104af4de0986625b450eb2de5acb8c6c,N,,2025-10-07 03:58:58.796885

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

Founded by Arkansas businessman, Harvey Couch, back in 1923, the business initially started out under the name of ‘The Mississippi Power & Light Company’, acquiring several utility systems throughout Jackson, Columbus, Greenville, and Vicksburg, right at the rise of the electrical industry. Today, Entergy Mississippi is a true powerhouse, leading the state of Mississippi at the forefront of energy innovation.

Energy, Oil & Gas last sat down with Entergy Mississippi in 2023 in celebration of one of its most significant milestones to date: its 100-year anniversary. Commemorating a century of excellence, Haley Fisackerly, Entergy Mississippi’s Chief Executive Officer, shared exclusive insight into the company’s heritage and how it continues to evolve with the industry, keeping affordability and reliability at its core. Now, as Entergy Mississippi embarks upon the latter half of its 102nd year, it continues to champion its legacy of innovation and dynamism within the electrical industry. The market may be changing rapidly, presenting a plethora of new challenges, but Entergy Mississippi is harnessing new opportunities to support its communities.

In September 2025, Haley rejoins Energy, Oil & Gas to offer an update on how the company has progressed. “What’s happened in the two years since we last spoke has been amazing. As we enter our next century of service, we are seeing a transformation in the business like we’ve never seen before,” Haley reveals. “When we were founded 100 years ago, electricity was still a new industry, and now, the industry is seeing a rebirth; a lot of manufacturing is moving back to the United States, and there’s been a huge growth in the number of data centers, cloud storage hubs, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We’re excited because this growth will allow us to better serve our customers and communities.”

In terms of new developments, Entergy Mississippi has been thrilled to announce perhaps its biggest partnership to date: a major data center project with Amazon Web Services (AWS). For a company that’s committed to empowering its communities, this project is monumental for Entergy Mississippi. Regarded as the ‘largest economic win in Mississippi history’, AWS’ investment in the state will change the lives of many, creating thousands of new jobs, generating significant tax revenue and funding an increasing number of charitable and philanthropic projects for communities.

“We entered into an agreement with AWS to provide two data center campuses in Madison County, which is a part of the Entergy Mississippi service territory. It’s the largest economic project in state history, fivefold,” Haley affirms. “AWS has committed over $10 billion to the state of Mississippi, which will create more than 1000 new jobs: it’s a real win for our customers and communities. These investments are also allowing us to pull two of our later-planned power plants forward, which will be a real benefit to our customers.

“Growth is very important when it comes to serving our customers because the more money we spend, the more cost we’re adding to the business, and if our customer base isn’t growing then that cost gets transferred to our customers. When 20 percent of your customers live below the national poverty level, you must be cognizant of that, so we were very aggressive in finding a partner like AWS to come in and help us to grow, invest and unlock new technologies.”

As Haley explains, this investment will accelerate Entergy Mississippi’s planned infrastructure upgrade projects, without transferring the cost to its consumers – a major win for the company and its customers alike. One of such projects is Entergy Mississippi’s Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, situated in Greenville, Mississippi. Focusing heavily on sustainable operation, Delta Blues is set to be a 745-megawatt facility able to power nearly 400,000 homes across Entergy Mississippi’s service area, which will significantly increase the quality and reliability of the energy provided to its customers.

“We recently broke ground on this $1.2 billion project, so it is under construction as we speak – a very highly efficient plant that uses less water, has less emissions and is much quieter. We’re going to install Mitsubishi turbines into the plant, which are 50 percent more efficient than what they’re replacing, and we’re building the plant in such a way that it can be retrofitted to use hydrogen fuel when it becomes more economic. We’re also building the plant to be adaptable to carbon capture capability, so that our CO2 emissions can be sequestered and not admitted into the environment,” Haley elaborates.

On the topic of environmental impact, Entergy Mississippi is also making significant strides into new renewable energies; in particular, nuclear. Haley comments: “We’ve been speaking with potential customers on partnerships within that arrangement. In the last couple of weeks [at the time of writing], we filed a request at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend an early site permit at our Grand Gulf nuclear power plant in Claiborne County, Mississippi. We won the ESP permit for that site back in 2007, which is now set to expire in 2027, but we’re currently working with the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Trump Administration on seeking an extension for another 20 years. That’s very important to us because it would help us to accelerate and reduce costs on another plant if we were to look at building one; it’s something we’re studying very carefully.

“For example, we’re looking at new technologies such as small modular reactors, which are greater passive safety systems than what we currently use today,” he continues. “We’re making investments in upgrading our transmission systems with more resilient, robust structures, as well as into various other grid enhancement technologies, to ensure that the grid is stable and operating at its highest capability.”

With all these developments well underway, Entergy Mississippi is positioned for an exciting 12 months and an even more exciting future. Continuing to build upon its past legacies, Entergy Mississippi enters a new era defined by ambition, innovation and technological advancement, taking both its customers and communities into the future together. Haley concludes by sharing what the next chapter holds for Entergy Mississippi.

“Now, we aim to look for other productive growth opportunities to serve our communities. Reliability and affordability remain at the front of our customers’ minds, and the new revenue generated by AWS is going to allow us to make further investments to offset the rate impacts to them,” he finishes, optimistic for the years ahead. “We’ll be rolling out a new reliability plan over the next five years to really drive that service and make the grid more reliable; we intend to introduce more self-healing networks to sense problems on the grid before they result in outages.

“When I talked about this being a transformational period within the industry, it’s worth noting that the United States is looking at energy dominance surrounding AI, and Entergy is making this happen – not just with us, but with our sister companies in Louisiana and Arkansas as well. We’re working to bring these opportunities forward, not only to benefit our customers and communities, but to unlock a new era of investment in the United States going forward.”",https://energy-oil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Entergy-Mississippi-228-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:59:41.406088

At the same time, the state has avoided more than 742,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

An independent group backing Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Ciattarelli campaign have ads distorting comments Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) made about clean energy and its cost.
She blamed Trump’s cancelling new clean energy projects for increasing costs to ratepayers.","Climate change – which is causing sea levels to rise and heat waves to last longer and be more intense — has taken a back seat to affordability issues in political campaigns, but recent spikes in utility bills have made it a key issue in this year’s race for New Jersey governor.

According to NASA, human activities – primarily the burning of coal, petroleum, natural gas and other fossil fuels – have led to an average 1.8-degree increase in the earth’s temperature since the pre-industrial era of 1850-1900 and that temperature continues to rise .36 degrees each decade. The Paris Climate Accords seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2.7 degrees or no more than 3.6 degrees by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels by half by 2030.

Under Gov. Phil Murphy, New Jersey has taken aggressive steps to reduce the state’s impact on climate change which include a detailed energy master plan and a target of 100% clean energy in the state by 2035. These and other actions are meant to address current and predicted impacts on the state, including more intense storms, sea levels creeping up on ocean and bay beaches, impaired water quality, more drought conditions and degraded air quality.

As part of its efforts, the administration rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gase Initiative, or RGGI, a market-based system in the northeast that aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Under the system fossil fuel plants essentially pay to emit greenhouse gases and participating states receive funding from the sale of carbon allowances. In total, New Jersey has received more than $1 billion through the program, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. New Jersey has awarded close to $233 million of that to about 400 clean energy and climate mitigation projects that include solar power, clean trucks and buses, charging infrastructure, the restoration of tidal marshes and investments in energy efficiency. At the same time, the state has avoided more than 742,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

The Murphy administration had banked on using offshore wind as a major provider of future clean power. But developer Ørsted pulled out, citing inflation and supply chain issues as setbacks. Since January, the Trump administration has taken several actions that have essentially ended the ability of companies to develop offshore wind farms. Atlantic Shores, which was to have been located off the coast between Atlantic City and Barnegat Light and provided enough power for roughly 1 million homes, ended its development effort.

Earlier this year, PJM Interconnection, the energy grid operator for New Jersey, held energy auctions that led to increased electricity costs of about 20% for ratepayers as of June. Another increase is expected next June. The state responded by giving about $430 million in direct relief to electric customers with at least $100 per customer and $150 for those with lower incomes.

Supply and demand are responsible for the higher prices, experts say. The higher demand for power is driven largely by the increase in data centers that deliver artificial intelligence applications, as well as hotter temperatures driving the need for air conditioning. And the power supply is not keeping up with that increased demand due in large part to a logjam at PJM of new energy sources seeking to connect to the grid and replace older coal-burning plants that have retired. New Jersey’s last coal-fired power plant closed in mid-2022.

The consumer concern over higher energy prices is considered so important this year that it is key in campaign messages to potential voters.

An independent group backing Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Ciattarelli campaign have ads distorting comments Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) made about clean energy and its cost. The YouTube page for the ad from Restore New Jersey shows that it has had more than 2.3 million views since Sept. 11. The New Jersey State Democratic Committee has posted on X, formerly Twitter, a short clip from Ciattarelli during a Fox News interview where he seems to say much the electricity rate hike is helping his campaign. The ad cuts off his full response.

Here are the candidates’ positions on climate change, clean energy and rising utility costs:

Republican Jack Ciattarelli

Ciattarelli acknowledges that climate change is real and that it’s “due to human activity.” But he disagrees with Murphy’s approach and has vowed to pull the state out of RGGI. New Jersey’s air quality is influenced by what happens in Pennsylvania, whose membership in RGGI is currently on hold while its state supreme court decides a challenge to it. Unlike New Jersey, which closed its last coal burning plant three years ago, they still operated in Pennsylvania. Ciattarelli said that getting out of RGGI will save ratepayers between $300 million and $500 million because electric companies are passing on the costs they have to pay to generate power, although environmentalists contend ratepayers are saving money because the state is a member of RGGI.

“The way to get down the monthly electric bill is to pull out of RGGI on day one, and I will by executive order,” Ciattarelli said in answer to a question from NJ Spotlight News while campaigning last month in Clinton.

At the same time, Ciattarelli said he plans to create a state Department of Energy, eliminated as a state department in 1988, to help reduce electricity rates.

“I don’t need 1-or-200 people, I need 12 policy experts that will work in partnership with the executive branch,” Ciattarelli said. “I do not believe that energy policy should be coming out of the BPU (Board of Public Utilities) or the DEP. Those are regulatory agencies. We need a department of energy that gives us a rational energy plan that solves the current electricity crisis and points us in the right direction for the future.”

He said he could find enough money to cut from the state budget to fund the new department.

Ciattarelli said he will implement a different state energy master plan that includes natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, and nuclear and solar power, but not offshore wind. He pledged to ban wind farms from being built off the coast.

Another vow from Ciattarelli is to “repeal unrealistic and unaffordable state mandates regarding electric vehicle sales, household appliances, home renovation and home construction.” Murphy set goals for adding electric vehicles to the state vehicle fleet and ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill

Freezing utility costs is Sherrill’s signature energy proposal, saying she would declare a state of emergency on utility costs on her first day in office. Gov. Phil Murphy and others have questioned whether the governor would have the power to do this, but Sherrill’s campaign chairman Sen. Vin Gopal and Stefanie Brand, the former head of the state Division of Rate Counsel, say they think she can. Sherrill pledged no utility rate increases over her first year in office.

“So immediately, as I put that out, we see an open letter from utility companies saying, we want to come to the table and be a part of the solution,” Sherrill told NJ Spotlight News during a campaign stop in Clinton. “We know that there is money coming in from RGGI or the BPU to defray some of these costs. Certainly, it’s a matter of, are you going to allow all of the agencies who failed to take on this problem, even though we saw it coming, to profit off the people of New Jersey or are you going to step in and be a strong leader and make sure that you’re driving change?”

In her position paper on energy costs and the environment, Sherrill said supports the need for New Jersey to do its part to alleviate climate change to help the state “hit our emissions and clean air goals.”

She pledged to expand cheaper and cleaner energy generation to “build an energy arsenal.” Sherrill said she would eliminate unnecessary red tape and make permitting easier for new projects, including solar and battery storage projects, and expedite upgrading the capacity of existing nuclear plants. She also said she would work to develop “new nuclear capacity” in Salem County.

Modernizing natural gas facilities is also part of her plan, with Sherrill promising to “make them cleaner and more efficient – which will lower costs, reduce carbon emissions, and boost reliability and energy independence right now.”

Sherrill, who has been endorsed by NRDC Action Fund and the state League of Conservation Voters, also said she would increase transparency and accountability for the state’s utilities, including the four electricity suppliers.

And she said she would have her attorney general, in coordination with other governors in the region, take the Trump administration and PJM to force them to allow the continued development of clean energy and connect new power generators to the grid. She blamed Trump’s cancelling new clean energy projects for increasing costs to ratepayers. Most recently, the Trump administration cancelled close to $5 million in research grants to Rutgers and Princeton universities.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2020/02/santana-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:59:46.319684

Key Takeaways

Clean energy grants provide funding for projects that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Eligibility criteria for clean energy grants may include project location, organization type, and project scope.

Research available clean energy grants through government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private foundations.

A solid project proposal for clean energy grants should include a clear project plan, budget, and expected impact.

Building collaborative partnerships with other organizations and stakeholders can strengthen a clean energy grant proposal.

Understanding the Eligibility Criteria

Before diving into the application process for clean energy grants, it is crucial for NGOs to thoroughly understand the eligibility criteria set forth by grant-making organizations. These criteria can vary significantly depending on the funding source, which may include government agencies, private foundations, or corporate sponsors. Common eligibility requirements often include the type of organization (non-profit status), project scope, geographic focus, and alignment with specific clean energy goals.

For instance, some grants may prioritize projects that serve low-income communities or those disproportionately affected by climate change. Others might focus on innovative technologies or educational initiatives. By carefully reviewing these criteria, NGOs can tailor their proposals to align with the funders’ priorities, thereby increasing their chances of securing funding.

Additionally, understanding eligibility can help organizations identify which grants are worth pursuing and which may not be a good fit for their mission or capabilities.

Researching Available Clean Energy Grants

Once eligibility criteria are understood, the next step is to conduct thorough research on available clean energy grants. This process involves identifying potential funding sources that align with the organization’s mission and project goals. Various online databases and resources can assist in this endeavor, such as Grants.gov, Foundation Center, and state-specific grant portals.

These platforms provide comprehensive listings of grants, including application deadlines, funding amounts, and specific requirements. Moreover, networking within the clean energy sector can yield valuable insights into upcoming grant opportunities. Attending conferences, workshops, and webinars focused on renewable energy can help NGO professionals connect with funders and other organizations that have successfully secured grants.

Engaging with local universities or research institutions can also provide access to collaborative opportunities and funding insights. By leveraging these resources, NGOs can create a targeted list of potential grants that align with their clean energy initiatives.

Creating a Solid Project Proposal

A well-crafted project proposal is the cornerstone of a successful grant application. It serves as a roadmap for funders to understand the project’s objectives, methodology, and anticipated outcomes. To create a compelling proposal, NGOs should begin by clearly defining the project’s goals and how they align with the funder’s mission.

This alignment is crucial; funders are more likely to support projects that resonate with their values and objectives. In addition to outlining goals, a strong proposal should include a detailed project plan that addresses implementation strategies, timelines, and measurable outcomes. Incorporating data and research to support the project’s feasibility can enhance credibility.

For example, if an NGO proposes a solar panel installation project, including statistics on energy savings and environmental impact can strengthen the case for funding. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders in the proposal development process can provide diverse perspectives and enhance the project’s overall design.

Building Collaborative Partnerships

Collaboration is a powerful strategy for NGOs seeking clean energy grants. By forming partnerships with other organizations, businesses, or government entities, NGOs can leverage shared resources and expertise to enhance their project proposals. Collaborative partnerships can also demonstrate to funders that there is community support and a broader impact potential for the proposed initiative.

For instance, an NGO focused on renewable energy education might partner with local schools to implement educational programs on sustainability. This partnership not only broadens the reach of the project but also showcases community engagement—a key factor that many funders look for in grant applications. Additionally, collaborating with businesses in the clean energy sector can provide access to technical expertise and resources that strengthen project implementation.

Demonstrating Community Impact

Funders are increasingly interested in understanding how their investments will create meaningful change within communities. Therefore, NGOs must articulate the anticipated community impact of their clean energy projects clearly. This involves not only outlining the direct benefits of the project—such as reduced energy costs or increased access to renewable energy—but also addressing broader social and environmental implications.

For example, an NGO implementing a community solar project could highlight how it will reduce energy poverty in low-income neighborhoods while also creating local jobs in installation and maintenance. Providing qualitative and quantitative data to support these claims can enhance credibility. Surveys, testimonials from community members, and case studies from similar projects can all serve as powerful tools to illustrate potential impact.

Budgeting and Financial Planning

A comprehensive budget is a critical component of any grant proposal. It provides funders with a clear understanding of how requested funds will be allocated and demonstrates the organization’s financial responsibility. When developing a budget for a clean energy project, NGOs should include all relevant costs—such as materials, labor, administrative expenses, and any indirect costs associated with project implementation.

Moreover, it is essential to justify each line item in the budget by explaining its relevance to the project’s goals. Funders appreciate transparency and clarity in budgeting; therefore, providing detailed explanations for costs can help build trust. Additionally, NGOs should consider including potential sources of matching funds or in-kind contributions from partners to demonstrate financial commitment and sustainability.

Navigating the Application Process

The application process for clean energy grants can be complex and competitive. To navigate this landscape effectively, NGOs should develop a clear timeline that outlines key milestones—from initial research to final submission. This timeline should account for all necessary steps, including gathering supporting documents, obtaining letters of support from partners, and allowing time for revisions based on feedback from colleagues or mentors.

Additionally, NGOs should pay close attention to application guidelines provided by funders. Each grant may have specific formatting requirements or questions that need to be addressed in particular ways. Adhering strictly to these guidelines is crucial; failure to do so can result in disqualification from consideration.

Engaging in peer reviews or seeking feedback from experienced grant writers can also enhance the quality of the application before submission.

Engaging with Local Government and Agencies

Building relationships with local government officials and agencies can significantly enhance an NGO’s chances of securing clean energy grants. Local governments often have insights into available funding opportunities and may even provide letters of support that strengthen grant applications. Engaging with local agencies responsible for energy policy or environmental initiatives can also open doors for collaboration on projects that align with community priorities.

Moreover, demonstrating alignment with local government goals—such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing renewable energy adoption—can make proposals more appealing to funders who prioritize community impact. Regular communication with local officials not only fosters goodwill but also positions NGOs as proactive partners in advancing clean energy initiatives within their communities.

Implementing Sustainable Practices

Once funding is secured and projects are underway, NGOs must prioritize implementing sustainable practices throughout the project lifecycle. This commitment not only ensures that projects achieve their intended outcomes but also sets an example for communities regarding responsible resource management. Sustainable practices may include using locally sourced materials, minimizing waste during installation processes, or incorporating educational components that promote ongoing community engagement in sustainability efforts.

Additionally, NGOs should consider how their projects can be designed for long-term sustainability beyond the initial funding period. This might involve creating maintenance plans for renewable energy installations or establishing community-led initiatives that continue promoting clean energy practices after project completion. By embedding sustainability into every aspect of project implementation, NGOs can maximize their impact while fostering a culture of environmental stewardship within their communities.

Reporting and Accountability

Finally, effective reporting and accountability mechanisms are essential components of successful clean energy projects funded by grants. Funders typically require regular progress reports detailing how funds have been utilized and what outcomes have been achieved. NGOs should establish clear metrics for success at the outset of the project and regularly track progress against these benchmarks.

Transparency in reporting not only fulfills funder requirements but also builds trust within the community and among stakeholders. Sharing successes—and challenges—through public reports or community meetings can foster ongoing engagement and support for future initiatives. By demonstrating accountability and a commitment to continuous improvement, NGOs can position themselves favorably for future funding opportunities while reinforcing their role as leaders in promoting clean energy solutions.

In conclusion, navigating the world of clean energy grants requires strategic planning, collaboration, and a commitment to community impact. By understanding eligibility criteria, conducting thorough research, crafting compelling proposals, building partnerships, demonstrating impact, budgeting effectively, engaging with local entities, implementing sustainable practices, and maintaining accountability through reporting, NGO professionals can successfully secure funding for transformative clean energy initiatives that benefit both their organizations and the communities they serve.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-10-06 23:58:40.703830

Earth's oceans face 'triple planetary crisis,' new report warns

Climate change is straining America's health care system: Study

Climate change is a public health emergency, driving heat, poor air quality, stronger storms, and new diseases that threaten people's health and strain health care systems, according to a new report from The Commonwealth Fund examining the impact of climate change on health and health care.

The report examined the preparedness of all 50 states and the District of Columbia to address rising health threats from climate change, identifying significant gaps in how health care systems respond to extreme weather, pollution and other climate-related risks.

The highest performers were Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine due to their clean energy policies, lower vulnerability to environmental hazards and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The worst performers were West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi.

However, the report makes clear that even the most prepared states need to do more.

""It's a mix for every state. There's no state that's at the top, ""Matthew Eckelman, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University and report co-author, told ABC News. ""What it tells us is that each state has some work to do.""

Rising temperatures and more frequent, intense heat waves have become the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, accounting for nearly 250,000 additional deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Extreme heat disproportionately impacts older adults, outdoor workers, people with chronic conditions and low‑income populations.

According to the report, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona are the most vulnerable to extreme heat, with Arizona experiencing more than 140 days over 100℉ in 2024 and Nevada approaching 115 days.

Air quality is another growing concern.

Warmer temperatures and more frequent wildfires are leading to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, both of which can exacerbate asthma, respiratory diseases, and heart conditions.

Smoke from wildfires — especially across the U.S. West — is now a significant health hazard and may be responsible for 200,000 excess deaths annually. Arizona and California had the worst air quality, while residents of Alaska and Hawaii can breathe the easiest with the cleanest air.

The report explains that extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, and storms can cause injury, water contamination and mental trauma.

These events often disrupt health services and basic infrastructure, compounding their long-term effects and jeopardizing the health of communities. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida stand out in this category, facing especially severe flood risks. The report estimates that nearly 15 percent of Florida hospital beds are located in high-hazard flood zones.

The health care system is not only at risk from these climate threats, but is also contributing to the problem, the researchers found.

More than 8.5% of the national greenhouse gas emissions originate from the health sector, with West Virginia, Wyoming, and North Dakota contributing the highest percentage per capita, according to the report.

And, while the report examines the national and state picture, weather events are also having a profound impact on local communities.

""Some disasters recently here in the U.S. have wiped out significant health infrastructure,"" Eckelman said.

Flooding in Western North Carolina wiped out some critical manufacturing facilities that supply life-saving medical supplies for the rest of the country, Eckelman explained. So, while the weather event only impacted one region of the country, it affected the supply chains everywhere, he added.

The authors of the report encouraged governments and health facilities to develop resilience plans and emergency plans so that they can continue operating during these events. They also challenged health care institutions to do their part.

""They can take a little bit of control over the emissions associated with their own operations and really abide by their mission to do no harm, not only through the care that they provide, but also in their behavior within the environment itself,"" Eckelman said.

Google’s $4 billion investment in its new facility, its $25 million Energy Impact Fund and its investment in the future of our students demonstrates what lasting community impacts a project of this magnitude can have,” said Entergy Arkansas President and CEO Laura Landreaux. “Entergy Arkansas is committed to powering growth and building a stronger, more vibrant future for the next generation and has found a partner in Google who shares this same vision.”

Google said it will cover the full energy costs associated with powering the facility, which Entergy Arkansas argues will contribute over $1.1 billion in net benefits over the life of the contract and help to reduce electricity rates for Entergy Arkansas customers.

The facility will be powered by Entergy Arkansas’s existing generation power portfolio and transmission grid, which will soon include a new 600-MW solar project, backed by a 350-MW battery storage system that will be located in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Google will pay rates that cover the cost of this resource, the utility added.

“Large industrial and technology companies are increasingly looking at our state because we offer reliable power at affordable rates, and we plan to keep it that way,” Landreaux said. “Large customers, such as Google, help support investments in infrastructure additions that not only help power their facilities but also result in improved grid reliability that benefit all customers.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Google-Entergy-Arkansas.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:59:50.518892

The White House announced $8 billion worth for clean energy projects would be cancelled. This is part of the first round of cuts the Trump administration said would occur during the government shutdown.

The project in question is called the Lodi Energy Center Hydrogen Project.

The U.S. Department of Energy canceled nearly $35 million for the facility, which promised to lower energy bills, create over 200 jobs and clean air.

The project would include the existing natural gas facility off Interstate 5 with the goal of producing clean hydrogen energy and increasing grid reliability.

According to Lodi Councilmember Mikey Hothi, the Port of Oakland has already indicated interest in fueling its heavy-duty machinery and trucks with hydrogen.

""We'd be able to fuel trucks up and down the state across the country using hydrogen that was made in Lodi,"" Councilmember Hothi said. ""What's going to change is that we're going to have to put that on hold for the time being. I'm still holding out hope that there's possibilities going forward, and I'm thankful to our local elected delegation that we're continuing to try to push for these funds.

OOSI said federal maritime law controls.","You would think that a Master Service Contract concerning boats and oilfield operations in the Gulf of Mexico would be governed by federal maritime law. In some situations you would be mistaken, says Offshore Oil Services, Inc. v. Island Operating Company, Inc.

The facts

Fieldwood and Island Operating entered into a MSC through which Island performed production services on Fieldwood’s Gulf of Mexico platforms. Most of the categories of “Work” identified in the MSC were those traditionally associated with production activities. Fieldwood contracted with OOSI for marine transport of equipment and Island’s workers on the platforms.

In the MSC Island agreed to indemnify third-party contractors such as OOSI against claims resulting from injuries to Island employees.

Fieldwood and Island agreed to a work order in which Island would fill “A Operator” positions. These operators would conduct BESE compliance testing and a host of other activities.

Island employee Felix sustained injuries while disembarking from a vessel. OOSI filed a Complaint for Exoneration From and/or Limitation of Liability and Felix filed a personal injury claim. OOSI demanded indemnification from Island.

The question for the court

Did federal Maritime law or Louisiana law govern the dispute? The question was whether transportation vessels would play a substantial role in the performance of the MSC and whether the parties expected as much.

There was no question that the indemnity provision required Island to indemnify OOSI for Felix’s personal injury claims; however Island argued that the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act rendered the indemnity provision unenforceable. OOSI said federal maritime law controls. The trial court granted summary judgment for Island, concluding that the LOAIA governed the dispute based on a finding that the MSC did not provide that the vessels would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract and that the parties did not expect vessels to play such a role.

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the take-nothing judgment against OOSI. The court applied the choice of law analysis in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Whether federal maritime law applied of its own force to the MSC depended on the answer to two questions:

Was the contract to provide services to facilitate the drilling or production of oil and gas in navigable waters? The answer was “yes”. Then the court asked if the contract provided or did the parties expect that the vessel would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract? To this question the court said “no”. The result of that “no” was the MSC was a non-maritime contract. There was not a direct and substantial link between the contract and operation of the ship, it’s navigation or its management afloat.

The result was based on the testimony of the parties. A Fieldwood employee testified to the effect that they typically don’t use equipment associated with a vessel but it had been done. Island’s president testified that operators perform no work on vessels. The provision relating to marine transportation concerned transporting workers to the platform and was not a description of actual work the MSC contemplated.

The trial court, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, ruled that OOSI take nothing. The MSC was not maritime in nature. Thus, the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act controlled, nullifying Island’s indemnity obligations. (OOSI agreed that if the LOAIA applied, the indemnity obligation would be null, rendering discussion of that question unnecessary).

President Trump is still considering a massive aid program for U.S. farmers… Trump officials are reportedly evaluating how money made from tariffs could supplement farmer payments. Official details about the bailout are scarce, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that information regarding “substantial support” for farmers would be released Tuesday. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday his administration will provide “some of that tariff money” to farmers, “who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit.”

Senator Grassley speaks up for Nationwide E15… Any farmer will tell you that they want to sell into the market and not harvest government checks. Although those checks may be necessary again this year, we need to address the root cause of this issue by giving farmers more markets. So, one very important decision that Congress could make is to have permanent year-round, nationwide E15. And, that would do just that, giving farmers more markets – particularly for corn.

Now, people would say, “Well, you better wake up,” because we’ve had nationwide, year-round markets for six years through presidential waiver. But we need to have this by legislation because we need more certainty than what an individual president might think about this issue. And you need that certainty because it’s going to take a lot of investment of infrastructure at retailers selling gasoline to invest in the equipment that it takes to have E15 nationwide. -source: Senator Charles Grassley

FDA moves NWS serum forward… The FDA recently, conditionally approved Dectomax-CA1 (doramectin injection) injectable solution for the prevention and treatment of New World screwworm (NWS) larval infestations and prevention of NWS reinfestation for 21 days. “We understand the urgency with which America’s farmers and ranchers are asking for tools to fight New World screwworm,” said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. “Today’s conditional approval – the first in the U.S. for NWS – shows our dedication to rapidly advancing important animal medicines when they are needed most. We continue to work tirelessly to complete review of other NWS products to protect multiple animal species in the U.S.”

“Under this conditional approval, the FDA has determined the drug is safe and has a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. We are making this treatment available to cattle producers immediately while the sponsor collects the data needed for a full approval,” said Timothy Schell, Ph.D., acting director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine.

The value of all energy trade between the United States and Mexico was estimated to be $57 billion in 2024, down from nearly $72 billion in 2023, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. A combination of lower petroleum output from Mexico and lower fuel prices, particularly for petroleum products that make up the bulk of the cross-border energy trade between the two countries, drove most of the decrease. Energy trade value represents the total value of energy imports and exports between two countries and is driven by commodity volumes and prices.

Most of the energy trade value between the United States and Mexico comes from U.S. exports of refined petroleum products to Mexico—$37 billion in 2024—which accounted for 64% of the total energy value traded between the two countries. The inflation-adjusted value of all U.S. energy exports to Mexico declined by 13% in 2024 from a year earlier to $41 billion, falling by less than the previous annual decline of 24% from 2022 to 2023. -source: U.S. Energy Information Administration

California’s adoption of E15 is a bright spot… California Governor Newsom’s signing his legislature’s E15 bill made the state the last remaining and biggest to allow sales of the higher ethanol blend. Renewable Fuels Association’s Troy Bredenkamp never doubted Newsom would sign the unanimously passed bill saying, “He [Newsome] got on board last year…RFA commissioned a study with UC Berkeley and others, that looked at, what would E15 mean to the California consumer. That study showed a $2.7 billion per year savings to California consumers—almost $200 per household.”

Those numbers reportedly helped fuel Newsom’s signature on the bill. Bredenkamp says California will add almost 600 million gallons of new demand for American ethanol or 200 million bushels of corn. He says he hopes California’s move will give added momentum to year-round E15 legislation in Congress.

The Texas Department of Agriculture enacted an emergency quarantine Oct. 2 to stop the spread of the invasive two-spotted cotton leafhopper, also known as the cotton jassid. Originally from Asia, the cotton jassid has spread across much of the southeastern United States and now poses a serious threat to Texas’ multi-billion-dollar cotton industry and other agricultural products, said TDA.

“Texas cotton farmers are the backbone of our economy and our communities,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. “Texas grows 40% of the cotton grown in the U.S., making this pest a major threat to our supply. I won’t let a threat like the cotton jassid harm our farmers, ranchers, nurseries or landscapes. We’re taking aggressive steps to stop this pest in its tracks.” The quarantine applies to shipments from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee where the pest has been detected.

ON THE ROAD: Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn’t forgiven car companies for helping nix California’s electric vehicle sales mandate, but the state’s top transportation lawmakers aren’t spending time looking in the rearview mirror.

While Newsom and other lawmakers traveled to New York for Climate Week, Assemblymember Lori Wilson and Sen. Dave Cortese — the respective chairs of their chambers’ transportation committees — were in Detroit meeting with Ford and General Motors executives as they attempt to chart a path forward for the state’s EV market.

The trip, organized by SoCal labor leader and former Michigan state Rep. Jon Switalski, took place amid the inauspicious backdrop of Newsom bashing General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he singled out by name as aiding the Trump administration’s successful maneuver to have Congress revoke California’s authority to enforce national-leading vehicle emissions standards.

“Mary Barra sold us out,” Newsom said during a Climate Week press conference late last month. “The Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump‘s leadership, but the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen. GM led that effort.”

Wilson said the policy disagreements made the talks awkward.

“It was an elephant in the room,” she said.

But she also said she was sympathetic to automakers’ dilemma.

“They feel like they’re being beat up by China,” she said. “They would like to see a voluntary collaborative transition that’s led by the market and allows them to stay competitive.”

The episode illustrates how raw the emotions are for Newsom and clean vehicle advocates who’ve watched the Trump administration systematically dismantle EV incentives, including the $7,500 federal tax credit for car buyers and HOV lane access, both of which expired last week. GM spent the most of any automaker — $11.5 million — lobbying the federal government through June. (That’s more than double the spending from Toyota, which also vocally opposed EV rules.)

“They didn’t spend as much as the oil industry, but were clearly part of the offensive,” said Matt Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters.

Cortese and Wilson, who were joined by Assemblymembers Rhodesia Ransom, Juan Carrillo and LaShae Sharp-Collins, said they walked away optimistic that the American auto giants won’t abandon their EV ambitions.

“The theme of both Ford and GM is, ‘We’re not going backwards,” Wilson said. “‘Despite the conversation happening, despite the advocacy, we’re committed to a zero-emission future.’”

Whether that means the companies are prepared to actively work with lawmakers and state regulators to advance California’s EV agenda is an open question. Cortese said he left the meetings with a sense that neither automaker was rushing to offer policy concepts to bolster the state market after the flurry of federal action.

“It isn’t very comforting from the transportation chair standpoint,” Cortese said. “It just seems like, if anything, they’re in a wait-and-see mode.”

However, both lawmakers said the looming specter of the Chinese electric vehicle market, which has rapidly developed into the largest in the world, has Ford and GM spooked and reluctant to step away from electrification completely.

“It’s no joke that there are very competent competitors elsewhere,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, which analyzes auto markets. “We must continue developing and producing because if we don’t, someone else is going to eat our lunch.”

It will take creative lawmaking from Cortese and Wilson to take advantage of that opening without the state’s EV sales targets and with an anticipated budget deficit that has already caused Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill federal tax incentives with a state-run program.

Their agreed-upon target for next session is one of the trickiest knots in the EV space — exponentially increasing the number of home chargers for millions of California renters, with little available funding to encourage landlords to install new infrastructure.

“That’s the missing piece,” Wilson said. “There’s still nothing like people going home, plugging in their vehicle and waking up in the morning knowing they can drive.” — AN

BOTH WAYS: While it’s been an awkward EV autumn between American carmakers and California officials, a Japanese motor company rolled out a high-tech new partnership with one of the state’s largest utilities.

Honda is partnering with Southern California Edison on an initiative to push forward the ability of electric vehicles to power homes, reports David Ferris for POLITICO’s E&E News. The idea has been around for more than a decade but has sputtered getting off the ground. As of now, some EV models are able to feed energy back to a home during a blackout, but that’s limited to when the house is disconnected from the electric grid.

Owners of the Acura RSX will be able to push the envelope further. In SCE’s territory, the grid will be able to actually turn the task of powering appliances like the dishwasher, induction stove and lighting over to the car during periods of high energy demand.

It’s a baby step toward the eventual dream of so-called bidirectional charging for EVs: Using the cars to send power directly to the grid, using them like a miniature, local version of a wind farm or natural gas plant. That is the possibility that most excites vehicle-to-grid experts. Americans drive their cars on average only an hour a day, leaving them idle 95 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“We would love to run, but we are crawling first,” said Chanel Parson, Edison’s director of clean energy and demand response. “We want to master crawling quickly so we can get up and walk quickly.” — DF, NB

NO CIGAR: Veto season is in full swing, and Newsom shot down a series of bills aimed at energy affordability Friday evening. How come? Concern that the proposals could actually cause ratepayer costs to climb.

That was the fate of SB 541, by Senate Energy Chair Sen. Josh Becker. If signed, the bill would have required the California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities Commission to evaluate the economics of “load shifting,” a practice in which utilities incentivize customers to use less energy during high-demand hours so as to reduce the strain on power plants and transmission lines.

Newsom concluded that piling more work on state agencies could backfire.

“At a time when electric bill affordability continues to be a pervasive challenge, it is important that we consider the workload and cost impacts on the CEC and CPUC, some of which are ultimately borne by electric customers, to avoid further compounding the costs embedded in customer electric bills,” Newsom wrote in his veto letter.

It was a similar story for AB 1408, by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, which aimed to expedite clean energy projects while saving ratepayers money by requiring the state to make it easier to plug new projects into the grid where spare space already exists.

“This bill risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability,” Newsom wrote.

Advocates for so-called virtual power plants also took a knock with the rejection of AB 740, which followed the veto of AB 44 earlier last week. AB 740 would have required the CEC to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan, a boon to the companies creating technology that pools energy by adjusting devices in homes, such as batteries and thermostats, to boost the grid during periods of high demand.

Supporters of the vetoed bills expressed a mix of frustration and surprise at the rejection.

“I’m disappointed in this veto of SB 541. This bill was about affordability,” Becker said in a statement, citing a study commissioned by analysis firm GridLab that found the state could avoid $13.7 billion in grid upgrades through 2030 by doubling its load-shifting target. “Next year this area will be a focus of the clean energy community — clearly we have some educating to do.” — NB

SMOLDERING: The U.S. Forest Service has paused planned prescribed burns during the government shutdown, an employee told Marc Heller at POLITICO’s E&E News after a staff meeting last week. The pause comes as the beleaguered agency is falling behind its 10-year average for number of acres on which it’s actively reduced wildfire risk through thinning, prescribed fire and related actions.

As of mid-September — about two weeks before the end of fiscal 2025 — the agency had treated about 2.2 million acres for the year, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, well behind the more than 4 million acres treated in the last year of the Biden administration. — MH, CvK

FOLLOW CALIFORNIA’S LEAD: California’s heat safety regulations are paying dividends for the state’s workers.

The five states, including California, that had heat protections in 2023 saw their odds of workplace injuries increase 8 percent during heat waves that year, while the risk in states without rules was double that, according to a study released Monday by Harvard University and the George Washington University.

The study found that almost 28,000 work injuries occur in the U.S. annually because of heat exposure, but protections like access to water, rest and cool places significantly reduce risk, Ariel Wittenberg reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

The new data comes after the Workers Compensation Research Institute released a study last week that found California’s heat standard reduced workplace injuries by more than 15 percent on hot days in “high-exposure” industries like construction, agriculture and transportation. — AW, AN

The decision comes in the wake of Trump’s decision Sept. 30 to withdraw his nomination of Ted Cooke, a former top official at the Central Arizona Project, to be Reclamation commissioner.

Raising EV fees to the highest in the nation takes us in the wrong direction, punishing families who are part of the solution.","In the last-minute rush to adopt a state budget, one casualty in the road funding package was a fair, forward-looking approach for electric vehicle drivers.

House Bill 4183 passed early Friday morning with a provision that significantly raises registration costs for EVs. As a result, annual fees for EV drivers will rise by $100, making the cost $260. That increase makes Michigan No. 1 in the nation for the highest, most punitive fees on EVs. A similar increase will be imposed on plug-in hybrids, from $60 to $110.

This outcome is deeply troubling, but it is not irreversible. It is up to the Legislature to solve the problem they created by lowering EV and plug-in hybrid fees to more closely reflect what comparable gasoline-powered vehicles pay. That approach would ensure EV drivers contribute their fair share, while protecting Michigan from being the costliest state in the country for EV ownership.

This fix is essential, because the new policy places a disproportionate burden on a small group of drivers who, according to our research, are already contributing more toward road funding compared to similar gasoline vehicles.

According to the state’s budget estimates, the newly passed measure would only generate $8.3 million in additional road revenues. That amount is negligible in the context of Michigan’s multibillion-dollar transportation budget, but it would create the nation’s highest financial barrier for families who choose to drive electric.

Michigan has built an economic strategy on becoming a hub for clean mobility and electric vehicle manufacturing. Automakers, suppliers, and communities across our state have and are investing in the transition. But the transition hasn’t been easy, and has come under strain by increased foreign competition, tariffs, and the elimination of federal tax incentives.

By increasing EV registration fees, lawmakers risk further undercutting the state’s clean mobility strategy and sending the wrong signal to businesses that are creating jobs in our state.

The costs of this decision, of course, fall on Michigan families. These high fees make it more expensive to own and operate an EV, hitting hardest the households already burdened by high transportation costs and looking to EVs as a way to save money and breathe cleaner air. Instead of supporting these benefits, the state is discouraging adoption and slowing progress toward transportation electrification.

Michigan has a proud legacy as the auto capital of the world, and our future depends on leading the shift to clean mobility. Raising EV fees to the highest in the nation takes us in the wrong direction, punishing families who are part of the solution.

It is now up to lawmakers to correct this imbalance and enact an approach that keeps Michigan competitive, supports innovation, and ensures all drivers contribute fairly to our roads.

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

About the Poll

The Rainey Center’s online survey of 2,010 likely voters was conducted on September 28, 2025. The poll has a margin of error of ±3.1% and was weighted for gender, race, education, and 2024 presidential vote.

Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) plays a key role in protecting endangered marine species and managing coastal habitats that buffer against storms.","Last week, the U.S. federal government announced it was heading toward a shutdown after lawmakers failed to pass a funding bill by the October 1st deadline. If this sounds familiar, that’s because it is, the government shut down for a record 35 days in 2018 under Trump’s leadership. As political blame circles in Washington D.C. and the media alike, one of our biggest concerns as a grassroots environmental nonprofit is the vulnerable position this puts our blue-green planet, and the communities who depend on it, in. We work every day to protect marine and endangered wildlife, and promote climate resilience. But we rely on strong public institutions to uphold it. When Congress fails to fund the federal government, the agencies that safeguard our oceans and coastal communities are forced to close their doors, furlough their scientists and halt critical protections. This isn’t just a political gridlock, it’s a direct threat to the ocean, fisheries and the people who depend on healthy marine ecosystems.

An Avoidable and Manufactured Crisis with Real Consequences

Instead of coming together to fund the government responsibly, extremists in Congress are pushing a Continuing Resolution that would lock in an 11% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the long-standing agency we depend on for hurricane forecasts, fisheries management and coastal restoration. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is using the shutdown as cover to accelerate mass layoffs and “Reductions in Force” (RIFs) at environmental and scientific agencies. These actions have already stripped away thousands of years of expertise and data, leaving our nation less prepared for climate disasters and more vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss.

NOAA: Our First Line of Defense Against Climate Disasters

When NOAA is shut down, we all lose and are in danger. Their mission is simple but essential — to protect lives and livelihoods through science, forecasting and stewardship. Without a skilled workforce and technologies the following is possible…

Hurricane forecasting delays: With fewer staff and reduced capacity, communities will receive slower and less accurate warnings just as we enter the height of hurricane season. Every hour counts when lives and homes are at stake.

Fisheries management on hold: A shutdown halts stock assessments and enforcement, creating uncertainty for coastal economies and jeopardizing sustainable seafood supplies.

Climate and ocean research stalled: NOAA’s research vessels will be forced back to port, and its laboratories will go dark. Critical studies on ocean warming, coral bleaching, and shifting marine ecosystems will be delayed or lost entirely.

Public resources offline: Communities rely on NOAA’s Climate Resilience Toolkit and open data platforms to plan for flooding and sea-level rise. A shutdown would cut off access when these tools are needed most.

Wildlife response curtailed: Marine mammal rescue and stranding programs will be scaled back, leaving endangered species like sea turtles and dolphins without critical emergency response support.

The Coast Guard: Working Without Pay and Burning Out

The U.S. Coast Guard, one of NOAA’s closest partners in protecting marine life and coastal safety, must continue operations during a shutdown but without pay. Tens of thousands of service members will still conduct rescues and patrol our waterways under immense strain. Training, maintenance and inspections will be suspended, reducing readiness and increasing risk. Port safety checks will be delayed and pollution monitoring will weaken, all while crews work unpaid to keep the nation’s coasts secure.

Offshore Enforcement Vanished: BOEM and BSEE

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) oversee offshore drilling operations and enforce safety standards that prevent oil spills. When these agencies are shut down, safe inspections stop, leaving oil rigs and pipelines dangerously unmonitored. Also, environmental reviews are frozen which give fossil fuel companies a free pass operate without oversight… a terrifying new reality. We’ve seen what happens when offshore drilling goes unchecked — from Deepwater Horizon to smaller spills that quietly devastate ecosystems. A shutdown puts us on that path again.

U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Paused Protections = At Risk Wildlife

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) plays a key role in protecting endangered marine species and managing coastal habitats that buffer against storms. During a federal government shutdown the following occurs:

Protections for endangered species like sea turtles, whales and sharks are delayed.

National wildlife refuges may close or operate with skeleton crews, harming local tourism and leaving habitats vulnerable.

Restoration projects are halted, weakening natural storm defenses.

Community partnerships and grants freeze, cutting off support for local conservation and coastal resilience initiatives.

Every day of inaction means more lost time for restoration, more risk for wildlife and more hardship for the people who depend on these ecosystems. Healthy oceans and strong environmental protections are not partisan luxuries, they are essential to our survival. Every delay in research, every missed inspection, every suspended rescue mission erodes our ability to adapt to the climate crisis and protect the living planet we share. We need a government that works for people and the planet, not one that shuts down when politics get tough.",https://i0.wp.com/seaturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ant-rozetsky-q-DJ9XhKkhA-unsplash-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-06 22:00:51.539689

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

The operators in the coal sector in the country have long been calling for some sort of action from the government, and although it took some time, the Indonesian officials have finally bent the knee to allow market reform in the coal sector, opening the industry up to increased exports and interest from outside nations.

The coal sector in Indonesia is vital to the success of the Asian nation

The coal sector is facing an uncertain future. Some industry insiders have lamented the reduction of reliance on the coal sector that has been exacerbated by the growth of the renewable energy sector, while others have pointed to countries like the United States that have implemented sweeping measures that aim to reinvigorate the coal sector.

The evidence would suggest that Indonesia falls under the states that aim to keep the flailing coal sector alive and thriving for the foreseeable future. Taking into account that Indonesia is the world’s third-largest producer of coal and lignite, one can understand the government’s easing of pricing regulations in the sector.

The government has removed the obligation for miners in the coal sector

The Indonesian government has revealed that it has removed the obligation for miners to use government benchmark prices as the minimum price for minerals and coal sales. As of March of this year, Jakarta mandated the use of a coal benchmark price for transactions in the sector, which it stated would exercise greater control over the valuation of both domestic and export sales.

The new decree from the government allows miners to sell minerals and coal at prices below the government-set benchmarks, which has been welcomed by industry insiders. The previous benchmark was also used to calculate royalties for the sales of the essential fuel source. However, the production levies and tax obligations will continue to be calculated based on the benchmark prices.

The news underscores the oversupply issues that the coal sector is currently facing. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has meant that global benchmark prices for fossil fuels have plunged by more than 70% since the end of 2022.

Despite the issues faced by the sector, Indonesian coal production has more than doubled since 2020. The sector has been growing at an average rate of 7% per year, reaching 833 Mt in 2024. Other nations have stated that the coal sector is facing a bleak outlook for the future.

The Stockholm Environment Institute outlined the importance of the coal industry for Indonesia.

“Coal is important for the Indonesian economy. It is a source of foreign currency and state revenues as well as employment. In coal mining regions such as East Kalimantan or South Sumatra where the majority of Indonesia’s coal is mined, coal revenues often account for more than 40 percent of provincial government’s revenues; in East Kalimantan, up to 11% of the workforce works in coal value chains.” – Stockholm Environment Institute

“It's a speaker system that simulates a V8 HEMI,” Kirkham said. ""To be completely honest, I didn't buy it for the sound. I bought it for the look.""

Kirkham cruised in with his car, and dad Jesse Sr. — but this could be their last opportunity. Organizers of the EVs4 EVV event won’t host another — said Caroline Nellis.

“It won't be going unless we get new blood or the dealerships take it over, because we can't, you know, I'm turning 75 this week,"" she said. ""Some of (the board members) are older than I am.”

Her organization, Tristate Creation Care, has organized the event for four years. This year, they paid an individual to organize it because Nellis couldn’t take the lead.

She’s suggested to dealerships that they organize future events to showcase their EVs.

“I don't know if they will decide to do that or not,” she said. “I don't know if this is a final time or if it will be carried on by others in a different capacity from us, but we won't be able to do it anymore.”

The 2025 event was decidedly sparse, but Nellis said test drives were a bright spot. She thinks more were taken this year than previous events.

At the event, a family from Henderson is checking out the brand new Volkswagen ID Buzz electric bus. David Beliles of D-Patrick VW, is showing off its panoramic sunroof, which can go from frosted white, to clear with the swipe of a finger.

“Wow, that's amazing,” said Leann Martin, while taking a test drive with her family. Leann was more skeptical than her husband Kenny. After the drive she was warming up to the idea, after asking about things like the battery range. She appreciated the rear legroom.

Nellis said such interactions with EVs are important, because the whole point was introducing electric vehicles to the public.

“So that ultimately they may end up choosing to buy one at some point and thereby cut greenhouse gas emissions,” she said.

There were enough test rides to warrant bringing two of the VW vans to the show. This is despite the federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles and hybrids ending last month.

She's encouraged by vehicles like the 2026 Nissan Leaf, for sale at just under $30,000. ""When cars, new cars that are EVs, start being under $30,000 I think that makes it more available to a larger segment of the population,"" Nellis said.

INSKEEP: Robinson Meyer of Heatmap News, thanks so much.","STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

A Florida man named Al Salvi noticed something recently. The electricity bills are rising in Pembroke Pines. And he told our colleague, Scott Horsley, that he pays up to $500 per month.

AL SALVI: Seniors down here that are living check to check, now we've got to decide whether we're going to pay electric bill or we're going to buy medication.

INSKEEP: Why is this happening? We called Robinson Meyer, who is executive editor of the climate and energy site Heatmap News. Welcome to the program.

ROBINSON MEYER: Thank you for having me.

INSKEEP: OK, so we hear politicians say that higher electricity prices are about the kind of energy we use, fossil fuels versus renewables, whatever fits their agenda. But it seems you've been focusing on some other factor in electricity prices. What is it?

MEYER: That's right. So I think the biggest driver of the run-up in electricity prices we've seen over the past four or five years, because electricity prices really shot up since the pandemic - they've been rising twice as fast as overall inflation - is the grid itself. And not only the grid itself, it's actually the most local part of the power grid, like that last mile from substations to your house or business.

INSKEEP: I don't automatically get that because the wires are already there and have been there for generations. Why would that get more expensive?

MEYER: In some cases, it's because they've had to be rebuilt because of a natural disaster. And in some cases, they are just getting old. It's actually exactly the fact that they've been there for generations. They're getting old and they need to be replaced. And in some cases, it's because maybe a wildfire burned through an entire area, especially out west. And now the utility has to go in, and not only does it have to rebuild that grid in the local area, it also has to rebuild it in a way that's not as likely to cause a wildfire in the future.

INSKEEP: This is sounding like an unseen cost of climate change.

MEYER: It is, I think, a cost of climate change. I mean, I think it's just that we've had the grid for a long time. I mean, in many places, it's 90 or 100 years old. And it's time for those systems to be replaced. And unfortunately, they're beginning to be replaced at the same time as we're seeing rising electricity demand for the first time in the U.S. in basically a generation.

INSKEEP: What is increasing the demand for electricity?

MEYER: So it's a few things. I think the headline driver is this boom in data center construction and AI, of course. And that is having big effects in certain parts of the country. The other things driving electricity demand are population growth and economic growth. You know, people are getting richer and they're using more electricity. There are people switching to EVs. You know, if you think about going from gasoline to EVs, you got to plug in your car. And then the last thing is something that I think everyone across the political spectrum wants to see, which is more U.S. manufacturing. As factories have gotten built here, that drives higher power demand, too.

INSKEEP: Is it inevitable then that as AI expands, and if the U.S. succeeds in reshoring some manufacturing that I'm just going to pay more and more for electricity?

MEYER: Well, it shouldn't be. And this is one dynamic that I think regulators and state leaders are grappling with right now. In the New Jersey governor's race, electricity prices have become a huge deal. And while I don't think electricity prices are increasing in most areas right now because of AI, I do think there is a good case that AI is driving some of the electricity prices in New Jersey specifically, and data centers specifically. Historically, kind of the way it's worked is that the utility builds out the grid to meet demand from everyone. And then everyone kind of foots the bill for that expansion. I think right now, given that just a few customers are driving so much more electricity demand, utilities and states are trying to figure out how we can, you know, meet that demand while not having absolutely everyone else pay much higher cost to build the infrastructure needed to service those facilities.

INSKEEP: Robinson Meyer of Heatmap News, thanks so much.

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

The pipeline will have capacity of up to 950 MMcf/d.
""This expansion allows Energy Transfer to offer its producers and shippers complete optionality in the market place,"" said Jim Holotik, Energy Transfer's vice president of project development.

The 950 MMcf/d expansion will bring the system's capacity to 2.3 Bcf/d and will bring the total construction cost of the pipeline system to $895 million. The latest expansion is expected to be in service in August 2007.

The new 36-inch diameter line will begin in Limestone County and run southwest to a connection with the 30-inch diameter Texoma system in Hardin County, northeast of Beaumont. Interconnects with several interstate pipelines are being contemplated. Additionally, the Texoma system will deliver gas into Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, a future NGPL interconnect, the Carthage hub, as well as both the east and west side Houston Ship Channel markets.

Energy Transfer said that increased producer commitments out of both the Barnett Shale and Bossier production areas created demand for the expansion project, which will allow shippers to benefit from pricing differentials between marketing hubs. The pipeline will have capacity of up to 950 MMcf/d. It also will increase the capacity of the Texoma system by over 600MMcf/d, with additional capacity available for both intrastate and interstate markets.

""This expansion allows Energy Transfer to offer its producers and shippers complete optionality in the market place,"" said Jim Holotik, Energy Transfer's vice president of project development. He said it gives producers access to three main Texas gas hubs: Waha, Carthage, and Katy, and affords additional access to interstates and east Houston Ship Channel markets.

""We are pleased to have filed the Summary Judgement Brief and to simultaneously be continuing our settlement discussions with the government to remove this illegal veto,"" said Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen.
The summary judgment briefs submitted by the plaintiffs argue that the EPA exceeded its legal authority when it vetoed the Pebble project.
""The facts cited by EPA in its veto decision are directly contradicted by the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the official factual record in this proceeding.""","Northern Dynasty, Alaska, Native corps seek ruling to overturn EPA block.

Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. Oct. 6 announced that it, along with the state and two Alaska Native village corporations, has filed summary judgment briefs in Alaska Federal Court challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's veto of the Pebble project, asserting that the action was unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

After more than a decade of federal review, regulatory reversals, and court challenges, Northern Dynasty's Pebble project culminated in a 2023 Clean Water Act veto issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which effectively nullified years of permitting work and barred development across 309 square miles of Alaska state land in the Bristol Bay region.

The decision, taken despite completion of a multi-year Environmental Impact Statement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that found the project could be developed without measurable harm to downstream fisheries or water quality, marked the first time the agency had used its Section 404(c) authority to preemptively block a mine on state land designated for resource development.

Following that decision, Northern Dynasty and its Alaska-based subsidiary, Pebble Limited Partnership, filed suit alongside the state of Alaska, arguing that EPA's action unlawfully exceeded its statutory authority, conflicted with federal findings, and undermined the Alaska Statehood Act's guarantee of resource management rights over state lands.

Over the next two years, the case moved through a series of pauses and procedural shifts as successive administrations reviewed the matter and federal agencies sought additional time to fill key positions and reassess their litigation strategy.

By February of this year, Northern Dynasty agreed to a 90-day pause requested by EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, granting new leadership an opportunity to review the record and evaluate a potential settlement to withdraw the veto.

Those discussions, extended through mid-year, ultimately concluded without resolution, returning the case to court and leading Northern Dynasty to request a summary judgment schedule.

With settlement efforts at a stalemate, the company now seeks a ruling on what it argues are fundamental issues of law, maintaining that the veto imposes significant economic and legal consequences for Alaska and the United States and contradicts both the conclusions of the project's Environmental Impact Statement and the state's constitutional authority to develop its own resources.

Positioned once again before the court, the case has entered a decisive stage as Northern Dynasty, the state, and two Alaska Native corporations – Iliamna Natives Ltd. and Alaska Peninsula Corp. – seek judicial resolution rather than administrative reconsideration.

""We are pleased to have filed the Summary Judgement Brief and to simultaneously be continuing our settlement discussions with the government to remove this illegal veto,"" said Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen. ""We believe we have a strong case and, along with our fellow plaintiffs, are confident that we will win.""

The latest filings lay out a comprehensive challenge to EPA's authority and interpretation of the Clean Water Act, framing the dispute not only as a matter of permitting but as a test of how far federal agencies may reach in restricting development on state-designated mineral lands.

The summary judgment briefs submitted by the plaintiffs argue that the EPA exceeded its legal authority when it vetoed the Pebble project.

Among the central claims is that the agency's 2023 determination disregarded the official record and the findings of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Final Environmental Impact Statement, which concluded the project could be developed without measurable harm to downstream water or fisheries.

The plaintiffs also argue that the veto imposed substantial economic costs on Alaska and the United States, conflicting with lands specifically designated for mineral development under the Alaska Statehood Act and Cook Inlet Land Exchange.

In addition, they assert that the EPA's conclusions relied on speculative rather than substantiated findings of environmental harm, and that recent U.S. Supreme Court clarification of Clean Water Act jurisdiction shows much of the Pebble deposit area no longer qualifies as federally regulated wetlands.

""And, frankly, we think the filing of this brief will help in our discussions with the government because it clearly highlights agency overreach of its mandate and interference in a project that is on state land which was designated, by statute, for mineral exploration and development,"" said Thiessen. ""The facts cited by EPA in its veto decision are directly contradicted by the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the official factual record in this proceeding.""

As court proceedings advance, the federal government has moved to temporarily halt the case, submitting a motion to stay all deadlines considering the partial shutdown of federal operations that began Oct. 1.

The request, filed after the plaintiffs' summary judgment submission, seeks to pause the court's briefing schedule until the government reopens and its legal teams can resume full activity.

""We object to this request because it is our strong preference to keep to the court ordered briefing schedule, which would require the government to respond by January 2, 2026. We have waited a long time for our day in court in this case, and we should not have to wait any longer to vindicate our rights,"" said Thiessen.",https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/0/0/9300/s_top,N,,2025-10-06 20:02:30.726842

That transaction, which occurred during the Serzh Sarkissian administration, was seen as dubious, since the sale of that particular power plant—bordering Azerbaijan—required parliament approval, but was completed in 2015.

Welcoming this initiative, Papoyan said that the deal demonstrates the long-term and stable presence of American investments in Armenia and proves that the Vorotan HPP Cascade serves as a guarantor of the country’s energy security.

“The fact that Armenia’s largest bank, Ardshinbank, is able to provide $135 million in funding for such a strategic project speaks to its ability to strengthen the banking sector, comply with international standards, and serve large investors,” Papoyan said in praise of the deal.

“This is a message that Armenia is not only open to investments, but also has strong local partners who can support their implementation,” he added.

The building that housed 300 megawatts of battery capacity was completed five years ago, around the time the U.S. utility scale lithium-ion battery storage sector was taking off, with battery safety standards having been updated multiple times since. And now the sector is having to deal with the fallout of the accident, with a growing number of leaders now strongly opposed to the construction of battery storage facilities in their localities.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, after passing a moratorium in July for a battery storage system proposed near the village line. In August, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York and complained that the state was rushing approvals to meet “delusional” clean energy goals. New York has set an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage over the next five years, equivalent to half of its large-scale systems.

“This is more than a fire, this a wake-up call for the industry. If we’re going to be moving ahead with sustainable energy, we need to have a safe battery system in place,” said Glenn Church, Monterey County Supervisor.

Battery moratoriums refer to a temporary halt on the approval and construction of new Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), often a local or state measure enacted to address public safety concerns related to fires and other hazards associated with lithium-ion batteries. These moratoriums gained traction starting in 2023 and 2024, driven by community opposition to proposed BESS projects near homes and schools, high-profile fires, and a perceived lack of comprehensive safety standards for the technology.

However, the experts have pointed out that BESS detractors could be overreacting, and the nascent industry is merely going through teething problems. “This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ofodike Ezekoye, a mechanical engineering professor and combustion expert at the University of Texas at Austin, said.

Fire risks and growing opposition are just some of the headwinds facing the U..S. battery storage sector. A recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), coupled with cuts to other climate policies, could slash U.S. battery production by ~75% by 2030 to 250 GWh from the previously projected 1,050 gigawatt-hours, and EV sales by 40%. According to the report, the new policies could eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing. Following the passing of the IRA in 2022, companies have announced a total of 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, with more than half yet to begin construction. Red and purple states including Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, would be the most adversely impacted.

Interestingly, even Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, home to Hyundai’s new $5.5B EV and battery manufacturing plant, threw his weight behind the bill, calling it “fantastic.” According to estimates by the experts, the project will create $4-5 billion in fresh investments in Bartow County as well as 3,500 new jobs. Over the past five years, EV-related projects in Georgia have created ~$17 billion in investments and more than 22,800 new jobs.

Meanwhile, the pivotal solar sector would face setbacks under OBBBA. According to a study by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the solar sector has recorded more than $160B in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA was passed three years ago, marking one of the sector’s most productive periods in recent times. Solar and battery storage have been the fastest growing energy source in the U.S., with the pair expected to account for 81% of new power additions to the grid in the current year.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

Losing streak ends Stellantis' 6% gain in the third quarter marks the company's first positive sales quarter in nearly two years.","Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat, posted its first sales gain since the second quarter of 2023.

Chrysler and Jeep brands posted double-digit gains.

Dodge, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo posted decreases, though the company noted positive trends taking place in the Dodge and Ram lineup.

Stellantis' U.S. sales rose 6% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, as the brand sold 324,825 vehicles. To keep momentum, the company announced it would take on the cost of the now-expired electric vehicle tax credit through the end of the year while supplies last.

The upswing in Stellantis' sales stands in contrast to the company's performance in recent memory. In the previous quarter, sales fell 10% compared with the same time period in 2024. First-quarter sales this year dropped 12% from the same quarter last year. That followed a 2024 overall decline of 15% year over year.

Despite a tumultuous 12 months — marked by tariff anxiety and an expiring electric vehicle tax credit that led to a massive rush for buyers to cash in on EVs — Stellantis' sales report is good news for the international automaker.

Company officials told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, the offer will continue on the now-expired IRS tax refund on EV sales, following a similar move from competitors Ford Motor Co. and General Motors. Unlike Ford and GM, which are offering credit by preemptively making down payments on vehicles, Stellantis is offering a $7,500 credit through a bonus cash incentive on existing dealer inventory.

According to the numbers, Jeep and Chrysler posted double-digit gains in sales compared with the third quarter of 2025, while Ram posted a slight loss overall, with strong retail sales nonetheless, as the newly retooled HEMI pickups hit the shop floor with orders exceeding production. Dodge, too, underwent a decrease, though the popular Durango — which comes standard with a HEMI — soared to a 44% increase over the model's performance in 2024's third quarter.

Here's how the brands performed in sales compared with 2024's third quarter, according to company data:

Jeep increased by 11%.

Ram decreased by 5%.

Chrysler increased by 45%.

Dodge decreased by 2%.

Fiat increased by 2% (which represents a difference from 316 vehicles in 2024's third quarter, compared with 321 in 2025's second quarter).

Alfa Romeo decreased by 21%.

Stellantis did not report data on its luxury offering, Maserati.

Losing streak ends

Stellantis' 6% gain in the third quarter marks the company's first positive sales quarter in nearly two years. Since May, when Stellantis hired its new CEO, Antonio Filosa, the brand has been on a campaign to revitalize its reputation and status in the American market.

Filosa, a native Italian with more than two decades of experience in the Stellantis family of automakers, replaced former Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares, whose rocky tenure fractured relationships with the UAW and dealers alike.

Under new leadership, Filosa has frequently indicated an intent to revitalize the U.S. sector of the company.

Though Stellantis ended its losing skid, the company turned in poorer sales numbers than its Detroit Three competitors, GM and Ford, which both reported gains.

GM and Ford reported sales on Wednesday, Oct. 1, with GM boasting an 8% increase compared with 2024's third quarter, and Ford's sales also rising about 8% over the same period a year earlier.

GM set a company record for EV sales, cashing in on a last-second push for buyers to purchase an EV before the $7,500 tax credit expired on Tuesday, Sept. 30.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/06/USNK/86555176007-20241202-t-090150-z-1343844782-rc-2-n-9-ba-4-faky-rtrmadp-3-autosstellantiseuropesales.JPG?crop=5183,2917,x0,y315&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-06 20:02:49.339425

The biorefinery is expected to be operational in 2028.

Eni on Sept. 23 announced has received approval from the Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy Security to convert selected units at the Sannazzaro refinery into a biorefinery. The company said it has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for the environmental impact assessment (VIA).

As part of the planned biorefinery project, Eni will convert the existing hydrocracker unit using Ecofining technology and construct a pre-treatment unit for waste and residue feedstocks. Hydrogen will be sourced from existing plants.

Once fully operational, the biorefinery is expected to have the capacity to process 550,000 metric tons of feedstock annually.

According to Eni, the planned conversion project supports the company’s commitment, through Enilive, to increase biorefinery capacity from the current 1.65 million metric tons per year to more than 3 million metric tons in 2028 and over 5 million metric tons in 2030, with the potential to produce up to 2 million metric tons of SAF annually by 2030.

Enilive already produces biofuels at its facilities in Venice, Italy; Gela, Italy; and Chalmette, Louisiana. The company is expected to begin operations at a biorefinery in Livorno, Italy, in 2026. Enilive is also developing biorefinery projects Priolo, Italy, as well as Malaysia and South Korea.

The group of plaintiffs -- made up of solar energy companies, labor unions and homeowners -- filed the lawsuit in federal court in Rhode Island. They accused the EPA of ending the program, in violation of federal law, that would have helped them save on energy costs.

Solar for All was ""expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote.

The program was ""expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs,"" according to the complaint.

Solar for All was established with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $27 billion to make buildings more energy efficient and to install electric vehicle charging stations.

In Monday's complaint, the plaintiffs accused the Trump administration of trying to recapture the billions of congressionally approved dollars in climate funding that was approved during the Biden administration. They are asking a jury to issue an injunction and force the EPA to reinstate the Solar for All program.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said Trump's domestic policy bill, passed in July, canceled ""billions of green slush fund dollars"" for Solar for All.

""The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin added.

(Snark aside: If Big Tech can afford to blow $350 billion on AI capex this year, it can spare some for not frying the grid.)","OPINION:

Oh, the irony of our artificial intelligence overlords: Silicon Valley’s geniuses, busy conjuring chatbots that can write your grocery list or compose bad poetry, are quietly sucking the life out of our electric grids. While Big Tech rakes in trillions of dollars, everyday Americans are left holding the bag — literally, in the form of skyrocketing utility bills.

The data centers powering AI are devouring electricity like a kid with an unlimited candy stash, and it’s high time we force these cash-hoarding behemoths to build their own power plants or buy directly from generators. With more than $368 billion in collective cash reserves — yes, that’s Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia lounging on mountains of money — they can certainly afford it.

Instead of leeching off the public grid and driving up costs for the rest of us, let them generate their own juice and sell back the excess, easing the strain on consumers. It’s not rocket science; it’s basic fairness.

Let’s crunch the numbers, shall we? AI data centers are energy vampires on steroids. In 2023, they guzzled about 4.4% of U.S. electricity, a figure the Department of Energy projects could triple to 12% by 2030.

Globally, the International Energy Agency warns that demand from these facilities could more than double by 2030, hitting 945 terawatt-hours, enough to power entire countries.

In the U.S., electricity consumption from data centers is slated to surge 130% by 2030, accounting for up to 44% of new demand and necessitating costly grid upgrades.

Who’s paying? You and me. Utility bills are already climbing, thanks to the Biden-era shuttering of reliable coal plants and the addition of huge amounts of part-time wind and solar. AI data demand is growing steeper as AI’s thirst grows.

One report calls it a “sharp rise” in bills, courtesy of infrastructure strains that hit households hardest.

This isn’t just about affordability; it’s about reliability too. AI demands 100% uptime. Those servers can’t afford a hiccup, lest your virtual assistant forget how to boil water. Grids are buckling under the load, risking blackouts and shortages. Deloitte estimates that U.S. AI data center power needs could hit 123 gigawatts by 2035, a thirtyfold jump, compromising grid stability.

Recent analyses show that data centers are doubling their consumption, forcing utilities to scramble and pass costs to consumers via rate hikes.

In states such as Virginia and Georgia, where data centers cluster, residents are already grumbling about inflated bills subsidizing tech giants.

Here’s the fix: Mandate that Big Tech build or buy its own electricity “before the meter.” Be their own generators, strike deals with producers, whatever; just don’t dump demand on the public pool or take away our needed supply. With Big Tech’s $368 billion war chest (and that’s conservative; quarterly revenue alone tops $100 billion for some), they could fund solar farms, wind arrays, natural gas and even nuclear reactors faster than you can say “ChatGPT.”

Then, let them sell excess power back to the grid, relieving pressure and potentially lowering rates for us plebs. In exchange, they get backup during maintenance shutdowns because even their shiny plants need tuneups.

Oh, and make them pay for grid interconnections. Why should ratepayers foot the bill for Big Tech’s reliability crutches?

This calls for legislative muscle. States such as Texas and California, already feeling the pinch, should lead with laws requiring data centers over a certain size to self-generate at least 80% of their power.

Congress could tie federal tax incentives for AI to energy independence mandates, or the Department of Energy could enforce grid-impact fees. A push for an Energy Department study on AI’s toll is a start, but we need action: bills that prioritize consumer wallets over corporate profits. (Snark aside: If Big Tech can afford to blow $350 billion on AI capex this year, it can spare some for not frying the grid.)

Enough with the free ride. Lawmakers, wake up. Enact these changes now, or we’ll all be paying premium for AI’s endless appetite.

“Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development for the Coastal Plain Venture,” Exxon said in an emailed statement.
John Titas, president of the Victoria Economic Development Corporation in nearby Victoria, said he didn’t think Exxon’s decision was related to the tax break fight.
Another firm, Expert Market Research, expects overall plastics markets to grow 51 percent in that time.
As soon as she heard about the new Exxon project, in December 2024, she said she leapt into action, involving herself in the various public processes she’s come to know about, including the school district tax break agreements.","Exxon Mobil will postpone its plans for a large new plastics production plant on the Gulf Coast of Texas, according to the company. Construction was initially planned to begin next year on the $10 billion facility in rural Calhoun County.

“Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development for the Coastal Plain Venture,” Exxon said in an emailed statement. “We’re confident in our growth strategy, and we remain interested in a potential project along the US Gulf Coast and in other regions around the world.”

Six weeks prior, a county district court judge invalidated the local school board’s decision to negotiate a tax break agreement with Exxon, following a lawsuit from Diane Wilson, 77, and her group, San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper.

On Aug. 19 the judge ordered the school board to redo its public hearing on Exxon’s tax break after Wilson alleged the district provided inadequate notice of the meeting in “a deliberate attempt to avoid public opposition.” Wilson, an internationally known environmental advocate, promised to bring a large audience for the repeat hearing.

“I think it definitely played into it,” Wilson said of Exxon’s pause. “I think if everybody had just rolled over for them, if they got exactly what they wanted and there wasn’t a big fight, there would be no delay.”

Exxon, which reported nearly $34 billion in profits in 2024, was seeking a 50 percent reduction in its property taxes to the rural Calhoun County Independent School District for 10 years, beginning in 2031, when the project would come online.

The world-scale plastics plant was planned to produce up to 3 million tons per year of polyethylene pellets for export, primarily to Asia, according to Exxon’s December 2024 tax abatement application.

John Titas, president of the Victoria Economic Development Corporation in nearby Victoria, said he didn’t think Exxon’s decision was related to the tax break fight.

“I think they’ve been very thankful for the support they received in the community,” he said. “It’s economics. To justify an investment of that magnitude, you’ve got to make sure the market will provide a return.”

In Exxon’s latest statement, first reported last week by Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, an industry news service, the company maintained the possibility of resuming the project in the future. “We’re maintaining good relationships with community leaders and contractors, so we are ready to reevaluate the project’s status when market conditions improve,” it said.

Exxon didn’t specify which market conditions would need to change. Most projections forecast strong growth in plastics demand over coming years.

The economic intelligence firm Precedence Research expects markets for polyethylene, which the Exxon plant would produce, to grow 64 percent between 2024 and 2034, according to a June 2025 assessment. Another firm, Expert Market Research, expects overall plastics markets to grow 51 percent in that time. According to the Plastics Industry Association, “The global plastics industry continues to accelerate, backed by strong demand.”

Wilson said the project’s delay marked the best news she’d heard since 2019, when she found out that her lawsuit against another nearby petrochemical giant, Formosa Plastics, would end with a settlement worth more than $100 million in penalty payouts, facility upgrades and cleanup projects.

A retired shrimper and mother of five, Wilson learned her tactics of resistance over decades of radical activism in defense of Texas’ coastal bays, where four generations of her family have fished for a living. In 2023 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize, the leading global award for environmental activism.

As soon as she heard about the new Exxon project, in December 2024, she said she leapt into action, involving herself in the various public processes she’s come to know about, including the school district tax break agreements.

“How a community reacts is extremely important and it’s extremely important that you do it in the beginning,” she said. “Move fast and don’t let up.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0482-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 19:01:52.801588

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials said they would go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ attacks on clean energy have led to higher utility bills for Americans nationwide. In response, state leaders across the country are enacting policies that deploy clean energy to lower energy costs and pollution. The Republican budget is expected to add more than $100 a year to Americans’ bills, and his administration’s attempt to block and limit wind and solar energy could cost even more.

State and local leaders continue to provide a different path focused on deploying clean energy at scale, reducing pollution, and lowering utility bills. In recent weeks, we’ve seen actions like California governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order to speed up clean energy projects eligible for federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits before they expire, and New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherril’s No Rate Hikes pledge that she made on the campaign trail last month.

KEARNEY INTRODUCES ABBY'S LAW State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-Delaware County, has officially introduced Abby's Law in the Pennsylvania Senate as Senate Bill 1008.","(TNS) — The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) this week announced the opening of the state's 20th federally-funded Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station — putting Pennsylvania in the lead nationally for the number of stations built using funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and representing a total federal investment of approximately $11.5 million.

The new station is located at Sheetz in Pittsburgh on Freeport Road along Interstate 76 (Exit 48).

Since the first NEVI-funded station opened in PA, the charging stations have delivered more than 30,000 charging sessions, powering over 3.5 million estimated miles driven and reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1.7 million pounds.

Additionally, PennDOT announced that it is the first state to receive a Full Build-Out Certification under the new federal NEVI guidance issued in August. The build-out certification allows a state to move beyond the initial phase of the NEVI program, which focused on building charging stations on the core network of interstate highways. This enables PennDOT to begin the next stage of the NEVI program — Corridor Connections — which will be released on or before Oct. 7.

""Thanks to our team's diligent work in 2023 and 2024, and Gov. Josh Shapiro's persistent efforts to secure Congressionally appropriated funding, we're in a position to continue making EVs more accessible for PA travelers,"" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. ""That quick action ensured Pennsylvania could adapt to national program changes while locking in investments for Pennsylvania.""

Per NEVI guidance issued Aug. 11, PennDOT submitted an updated Pennsylvania NEVI State Plan and a second request for Full Build-Out Certification to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on Aug. 27. The next phase will begin projects that connect communities.

The NEVI State Plan was approved on Sept. 5, and PennDOT received Full Build-Out Certification on Sept. 22, 2025. Having received approval, the Shapiro Administration is moving forward with the community phase of the NEVI program, beginning with the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity.

The Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity focuses on implementing EV charging stations along major roadways to strengthen long-distance travel outside of previously designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.

PennDOT anticipates soliciting about 24 projects through the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity, with up to $20 million in available funding.

The submission period will close at 5 p.m. on Jan. 30, 2026.

PENNDOT WELCOMES PROPOSALS

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Office of Public-Private Partnerships (P3) announced this week that it is accepting unsolicited proposals for transportation projects from the private sector through Oct. 31.

Instructions on how to submit a project and information on the unsolicited proposal review process can be found on the state's P3 website. PennDOT holds an unsolicited proposal period in April and October each year.

The submission period applies to PennDOT-owned projects, infrastructure, and services. During this period, the private sector can submit proposals offering innovative ways to deliver transportation projects across all modes, including roads, bridges, rail, aviation, and ports. Proposals can also include more efficient models to manage existing transportation-related services and programs.

The private sector may also submit applications for non-PennDOT-owned assets directly to the P3 board during this time. Transportation entities outside of the governor's jurisdiction, such as transit authorities and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, may establish their own timelines or accept proposals year-round.

The state's P3 law allows PennDOT and other transportation authorities and commissions to partner with private companies to participate in delivering, maintaining, and financing transportation-related projects.

As part of the P3 law, the seven-member Public Private Transportation Partnership Board was appointed to examine and approve potential public-private transportation projects. If the board determines a state operation would be more cost-effectively administered by a private company, PennDOT would issue a Request for Proposals and start a competitive procurement as defined by the P3 law.

The next unsolicited proposal acceptance period will occur in April 2026.

PENNDOT INVITES YOU TO SHARE FEEDBACK

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) is accepting feedback on construction and maintenance services through an online survey.

The public can take the survey through October 21 by visiting — 2025 PennDOT Construction/Maintenance Customer Satisfaction Survey.

PennDOT has been hard at work improving Pennsylvania's roads and bridges throughout the year, improving more than 2,600 miles of road, including over 900 miles of paving, and beginning work to repair, replace, or preserve more than 230 bridges from January through August of this year, officials said.

""The PennDOT team is serving Pennsylvanians every day, and each year we look for feedback on what we're doing well and could improve,"" Carroll said. ""The survey also lets the public tell us how they receive roadway information and helps us find potential educational opportunities.""

The 22-question survey asks participants how they receive PennDOT roadway information and how often PennDOT meets or exceeds expectations in construction and maintenance activities. Respondents are also asked about experiences with reporting concerns to the department, and whether or how they use the state's 511PA traveler information services.

KEARNEY INTRODUCES ABBY'S LAW

State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-Delaware County, has officially introduced Abby's Law in the Pennsylvania Senate as Senate Bill 1008.

The legislation is named in memory of 12-year-old Abigail Gillon, who tragically passed after an e-scooter crash in June 2025 in Aston.

Since announcing his intention in July to introduce the legislation, several serious e-scooter crashes have occurred in the region, underscoring the urgent need for safeguards.

Municipalities have also taken action to underscore Pennsylvania's current laws — Marple Township voted to ban e-scooters outright, while Haverford Township recently passed an ordinance requiring children under 16 to wear helmets when riding e-bikes.

Kearney's proposal has drawn national attention, with safety groups and media outlets across the country highlighting the legislation and its intention.

Kearney's office has been working closely with Abby's family and a wide range of stakeholders to shape the bill so it can move quickly through the legislative process.

""Abby's loved ones have experienced an unimaginable loss,"" Kearney said. ""This is not just about policy. It is about protecting our children and creating commonsense measures that keep pace with changing technology.""

While most other states have legalized e-scooters and set rules for their operations, e-scooters are not recognized under Pennsylvania's Vehicle Code, leaving riders without any clear rules or standards.

To address this gap in regulation and prevent further tragedies, Kearney introduced Abby's Law as a step forward to improve safety on public streets.

This legislation would:

Set an age minimum of 16 for e-scooter riders, and require helmets for 16- and 17-year-old riders

Set a statewide speed limit of 20mph for e-scooters

Prohibit more than one rider on an e-scooter

Require e-scooters to follow bicycle traffic rules

Provide for rider and driver education and awareness

Abby's Law has been referred to the Senate Transportation Committee.

Governor Shapiro’s Administration is setting records, creating more opportunity for Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.

Harrisburg, PA – Under Governor Josh Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is emerging as a national model for economic development — delivering real results that position the Commonwealth to compete and win, attract investment, and create opportunity in communities across the state. As the Governor speaks to the PA Chamber of Commerce & Industry’s Annual Dinner this evening, Pennsylvania is winning major economic deals.

From day one, Governor Shapiro has prioritized making Pennsylvania more competitive — launching the Commonwealth’s first economic development strategy in nearly two decades, securing $550 million for site development, Main Streets, workforce training, innovation and small businesses, and streamlining permitting, licensing, and certification processes to help projects get built faster.

“Pennsylvania is competing again — and we’re winning,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re building new industrial sites, revitalizing our Main Streets, and supporting small businesses across the Commonwealth. We’ve cut permitting times and taxes, reduced backlogs and waitlists, and made government move at the speed of business. As a result, we’re winning historic deals including the largest private sector investment in our history and we’re attracting more companies to grow here and create good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians. The Commonwealth is open for business — and we’re just getting started.”

The Shapiro Administration has secured a record $25.6 billion in private-sector investment and created nearly 12,400 new jobs since taking office — transforming communities and positioning Pennsylvania for sustained, long-term growth.

Governor Shapiro has also cut taxes, modernized government, and expanded funding to prepare more sites for business expansion — helping Pennsylvania earn the title of #1 State in the Northeast for Regional Economic Competitiveness from Site Selection Magazine. These reforms have also helped attract the largest private-sector investment in Pennsylvania’s history: a $20 billion initial investment from Amazon to build new AI and cloud computing campuses across the Commonwealth, creating thousands of high-tech and construction jobs.

Cutting Red Tape and Moving at the Speed of Business

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is reforming government and delivering faster, more predictable permitting and licensing processes that give businesses the certainty they need to invest and grow.

When the Governor took office, business filings could take up to eight weeks to process. Now, entrepreneurs can receive approvals in as little as one day. The Department of Environmental Protection has eliminated 98 percent of its permit backlog and processed over 20,000 labor-intensive permits this year.

Governor Shapiro has transformed how Pennsylvania does business by making government more efficient and responsive:

Launched the Office of Transformation and Opportunity (OTO) to coordinate permitting and business support, assisting over 200 companies in 2024.

Created the PA Permit Fast Track Program, the first in the nation for multi-agency coordination to expedite major projects — now supporting 7 public-facing projects.

Introduced PAyback, a money-back guarantee for timely permit and license processing — with over 40 million applications processed and only five refunds issued to date.

Securing Historic Investment and Growing Pennsylvania’s Economy

Governor Shapiro’s focus on competitiveness and reform has led to record-breaking private investment across Pennsylvania.

In June, the Governor announced Amazon’s $20 billion investment to establish high-tech cloud computing and AI innovation campuses – the largest private sector investment in Pennsylvania history – creating at least 1,250 high-paying, high-tech jobs in Westmoreland and Bucks Counties. The Shapiro Administration also committed $10 million for workforce development to expand vo-tech programs, add new CTE classes, and build training centers that prepare Pennsylvanians for these jobs of the future.

Companies like Excelitas Technologies, which moved its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh, and Adare Pharma, which relocated its headquarters to Northeast Philadelphia, are choosing Pennsylvania as their home for growth.

Across the Commonwealth, manufacturers like B. Braun in the Lehigh Valley and Joseph Machine Company in York County are expanding their facilities, creating hundreds of new jobs, and strengthening Pennsylvania’s industrial backbone.

These efforts are driving new investments across the Commonwealth — from revitalizing Downtown Pittsburgh with $60 million in state capital that’s leveraging $600 million in private investment, to strengthening the Commonwealth’s main streets and small businesses that anchor local economies through the Main Streets Matters program.

Building the Energy Economy of the Future

Governor Shapiro reaffirmed his commitment to an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that keeps costs low, supports Pennsylvania jobs, and ensures reliable power for businesses and families.

Under his leadership, Pennsylvania is producing more energy than ever before – including restarting operations at Three Mile Island and converting former coal-fired power plants into natural gas facilities that will generate an additional 5 gigawatts of power for the regional grid.

Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan — supported by a bipartisan coalition of industry and environmental leaders — will create jobs, lower energy costs, speed up permitting, and expand energy generation right here in Pennsylvania.

Last month, the Governor convened the first-ever state-led PJM Governors Collaborative, bringing together representatives from 13 states to push for regional action to improve grid reliability, reduce costs, and accelerate clean energy deployment for 67 million customers.

Investing in Infrastructure, Innovation, and the Workforce

Through Governor Shapiro’s 2024–25 bipartisan budget, the Shapiro Administration invested $500 million in site development, including $400 million for the PA SITES Program to make more locations shovel-ready for business investment.

To date, 18 projects have been awarded $74.6 million, helping communities across Pennsylvania compete for new job-creating opportunities.

The Governor’s 2025–26 budget proposal builds on this momentum with major investments in innovation, workforce, and tax reform:

$50 million for scientific and technological innovation — including $30 million for life sciences and $20 million for large-scale research and development.

$10 million for the new AdvancePA Tax Credit to attract and retain high-quality jobs.

$12.5 million for WEDnetPA to close workforce gaps.

Accelerated Corporate Net Income Tax cuts to reach 4.99 percent by 2029, and streamlined and modernized tax credits to focus on high-impact growth industries.

Governor Shapiro’s leadership is delivering results: faster government, stronger communities, and an economy built for the future. The Shapiro Administration continues to move quickly and efficiently to process permit applications, get businesses answers, and land major deals that benefit the people of Pennsylvania.

There, the plan for the future includes a $55 million fund, through an agreement between Washington State and the coal plant owner, to help the Centralia community transition.","The last coal-fired power plant in New England, Merrimack Station, has stopped running.

With the closure of that facility, the region is poised to become the first in the United States without a coal plant on its grid (though New York state, which has its own regional grid operator, stopped burning coal in 2020).

Granite Shore Power, the company that owns the coal plant in Bow, New Hampshire, said they ceased commercial operations September 12th, about a year and a half since they announced they would retire their facility by 2028 as part of a settlement agreement with environmental groups.

“For nearly three quarters of a century, Merrimack Station has reliably served the energy needs of families and businesses across New Hampshire,” the company wrote in a statement.

The facility still has two kerosene-fired generators that will continue running. It has been struggling to keep its coal-fired generators in compliance with state regulations for more than two years.

“I’m so glad that we are not going to burn any more coal in New Hampshire,” said Kendra Ford, a climate organizer with 350 New Hampshire. “I know that this is hard on people who work there, and I know that the town of Bow may also be a little caught off guard by it closing at this moment, so I hope that lots of things can be done for those folks.”

Merrimack Station and another plant owned by Granite Shore Power, Schiller Station, are the last two coal-fired plants connected to New England’s regional electric grid. Schiller Station has not burned coal since 2020. In Maine, a paper mill burns coal to power their own operations.

Mary Cate Colapietro, a spokesperson for New England’s regional grid operator, said the organization has not received a formal retirement request from Merrimack Station, but the region does not depend on the facility for the grid’s reliability.

“Coal generation accounted for only 0.22% of power in the region in 2024,” Colapietro said.

Colapietro said there is no way to track what kinds of fuel are being used to generate the electricity that is imported from other regions, meaning it’s not a given that New Englanders are using coal-free power.

But with Merrimack Station shutting down, there will no longer be coal burned in New England to power the grid.

Granite Shore Power said they would provide assistance or placement services to employees who lost their jobs, and that they were considering “all opportunities” for redevelopment at the site of the plant.

Local transitions

Merrimack Station opened in the 1960s. It generated power for the regional grid – and had a major impact on the community that hosted it, the town of Bow.

“Back when it was built, it was the largest taxpayer in town by far,” said David Stack, Bow’s town manager.

The amount of revenue that Bow got from property taxes on the coal plant allowed the town to keep tax rates low, leading to a boom in residential development. The impact was especially profound because New Hampshire towns depend heavily on property taxes, Stack said.

But the value of the plant, and how much they should pay in taxes, has been the subject of yearslong conflict between Bow and the owners of Merrimack Station – first Public Service of New Hampshire and Eversource, and more recently, Granite Shore Power.

The conflict led to a lawsuit, in which Bow had to pay Eversource millions of dollars, after the New Hampshire Supreme Court found they had charged the company too much in taxes. Stack says that as the value of the plant has continued to drop, Bow has felt the economic impact.

Over the last 15 years, Stack says, Bow has tried to adapt. Officials have worked to become friendlier to developers, changing zoning rules. Firms like DHL and Coastal Forest Products opened distribution centers in town. But other than mixed-use developments that are primarily residential, Stack says there aren’t a lot of new opportunities.

“As far as manufacturing, you don’t really see that anymore,” Stack said. “I just don’t know if big commercial ventures beyond Amazon are that successful.”

A few years ago, the taxes from new commercial developments surpassed the taxes the power plant was paying – a major turning point for reducing Bow’s reliance on the plant. But despite the town’s preparation, the news of Merrimack Station’s closure came as a surprise.

“We realized we were going to get to this point eventually,” Stack said. “I thought they had a little more time.”

Stack says Granite Shore Power has never sat down with officials in Bow to talk about the future. The company has said publicly that they’re hoping to turn Merrimack Station and Schiller Station into “renewable energy parks,” with batteries and solar. Jim Andrews, the head of Granite Shore Power, said in 2024 he wasn’t planning to include natural gas as part of the redevelopment. But, he said, it’s not off the table.

“We’re concerned with the valuation. But we don’t know exactly what technology they’re looking at putting there,” Stack said.

National shifts

In the opposite northern corner of the country, other communities are also preparing to leave coal behind. Oregon and Washington are planning to eliminate coal from their generation portfolio by the end of this year, when the Centralia, WA coal plant is scheduled for retirement.

There, the plan for the future includes a $55 million fund, through an agreement between Washington State and the coal plant owner, to help the Centralia community transition.

Coal still makes up about 8% of the generation capacity in the Northwest, including Idaho and Montana. Next door, in California, coal still made up a small fraction of the state’s power production as of 2024.

Nationally and globally, coal has been on its way out for years. Coal plants account for the largest share of retiring energy generators in the country.

Research shows coal has become more expensive than other fuel options. And it’s one of the most carbon-emitting fossil fuels, creating emissions that can harm the health of people nearby and that fuel climate change.

Still, coal accounted for about 16% of the U.S.’s power generation in 2023. Some plants are delaying retirements. The Trump Administration has announced several efforts to expand the industry, including putting millions of dollars towards re-opening or modernizing coal plants, opening millions of acres of federal land for coal mining, and relaxing federal environmental rules that affect the burning of coal.

For Kendra Ford, the climate advocate, Merrimack Station’s closure seems to be another sign of the industry in decline, despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to revive it.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3322f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F36%2F733bea6a4cf69221e0b9b8ed0e2f%2Fbowcoalprotest0612.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 18:02:55.214070

October 6, 2025 (Washington) – Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) along with the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG), and the Lawyers Committee for Rhode Island, filed a legal challenge in federal court on behalf of a coalition of businesses and nonprofits to reverse the Trump administration’s illegal termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Solar for All represents a generational opportunity to cut skyrocketing power bills, create new good jobs, and equip our communities to address the causes and consequences of a changing climate. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to unlawfully terminate the program.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at CLF. “This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat. Stripping those benefits away is unlawful and betrays communities. We will not let it stand.”

Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a statewide organization of trade unions representing more than 80,000 people. EPA’s attempt to terminate Solar for All deprived their members of opportunities for apprenticeships and job training that would have been crucial for a clean energy future.

Solar United Neighbors is also joining the challenge as a nonprofit working in multiple states on projects like creating solar-powered homes that can serve as a refuge for neighbors during power outages in Texas.

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All. This popular program was poised to bring more solar to our communities, provide jobs for the small businesses installing those projects, and help families get cheap, clean power,” said SELC Senior Attorney Nick Torrey. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal against a million American families and communities who need access to clean, affordable energy. By terminating the Solar for All program while simultaneously ending clean air protections, this administration is sending a clear message: they will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry. We will not allow this administration to trample the legal rights of Americans, and we will keep fighting for a clean, affordable future for the people and the planet,” L4GG Vice President of Climate Change and Environmental Justice Jillian Blanchard said.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” said Amy Romero, Chief Legal Counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island. “EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

Background

In 2024, through Solar for All, EPA awarded $7 billion in grants to organizations nationwide to provide energy bill relief to over 900,000 households. All that funding is intended to get affordable solar power to more people through new leasing and power purchase programs, multifamily installations, workforce development and more.

About 28 million households across the country face a high or severe energy burden, meaning they spend a high percentage of their income on energy bills. Solar for All rooftop and community solar programs are helping to alleviate these burdens with a guaranteed 20% savings on electricity bills for participating households. Nationwide, the program is expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills and generate 200,000 new jobs alongside workforce training programs. In addition, the SFA program is a source of immediate, cost-effective energy for strained electric grids across the country.

View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire","American Power Group Corporation (""APG"") (OTC PINK:APGI),the leading dual fuel diesel engine conversion technology company, is pleased to announce their participation and support of the Transport Project's Public Policy and Lobby Washington, D.C. fly-in event to be held October 7-8, 2025, at the Transport Project's Washington, D.C. offices.

Participants will be joined by subject matter experts for a full day of policy discussions on Tuesday, October 7th, including a deep dive on RNG fleeting policy priorities, extending the $0.50/gallon Alternative Fuel Tax Credit, establishing a $1.00/gallon Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Fuel Tax Credit, and preserving RNG viability in EPA's regulatory programs such as the Phase 3 GHG Rule and the Renewable Fuel Standard. On Wednesday, October 8th, participants along with Transport Project staffers will be meeting on Capitol Hill to lobby Members of Congress and senior staff on industry issues.

Chuck Coppa, APG's CEO/CFO, will be representing APG along with multiple industry executives spanning vehicle and engine manufacturers, servicers, suppliers, fuel producers and providers as well as multiple industry trade organizations. Mr. Coppa will be discussing APG's practical, affordable, and proven alternative fuel solution to convert existing Class 8 diesel trucks with APG's vehicular Dual Fuel System. With no loss of power and torque, the Dual Fuel solution provides the ability to realize meaningful net fuel savings through the substitution of up to 60% natural gas including low-carbon and negative-carbon renewable natural gas. According to the American Trucking Association, 95.8% of all carriers operate 10 or less trucks and 99.7% operate 100 or less trucks which makes APG's Dual Fuel solution so appealing as we believe most fleets are either just hesitant of change or do not have the financial resources to completely swap out their entire diesel fleet for cleaner burning vehicles.

Mr. Coppa noted, ""Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, reducing on-road transportation related operating costs and emissions while using readily available cleaner burning domestic fuel sources should be a top priority and is an important step in America's goal of achieving energy dominance and independence. I am excited to represent APG alongside so many high-profile industry executives.""

The EV maker and its rivals are bracing for a sharp drop in sales in the last three months of the year without the $7,500 in credits. While some have cut prices and found mechanisms to extend the benefits of the credit, others have cut production plans in anticipation of a slump.

The EV industry has already been grappling with high tariffs on imports of vehicles and auto parts into the U.S.

While Lucid makes its vehicles in the U.S., it imports some parts from abroad. Lucid vehicles did not qualify for the tax credits on cash purchases, but it used the credits to offer attractive leases.

Lucid handed over 4,078 vehicles in the quarter, compared with estimates of 4,286 deliveries seven analysts, on average, were expecting, according to Visible Alpha. This compares with 2,781 vehicles delivered a year ago.

EV giant Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries on Thursday, while Rivian also beat sales estimates as consumers rushed to buy EVs ahead of the incentive’s September 30 deadline.

The company has put in place offers and discounts to boost the appeal of its luxury Air sedans to attract consumers who have pared back big-budget spending because of high interest rates.

The EV maker has been aggressively striking deals with North American companies to domestically source critical minerals used in manufacturing.

The company’s fortunes rely heavily on the success of its newly launched Gravity SUV and the upcoming mid-size car, which targets a $50,000 price point, as the company looks to expand its consumer base.

The department has evolved its services over time to include technology strategy and design services, application development, and managed security services. In 2017, DIR began offering public cloud services, starting with Azure and AWS, and recently added Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. The goals are to avoid vendor lock-in, which limits technology choice, and provide access to the latest innovations and best-of-breed solutions.

“Texas is a big state, and we have a lot of government entities with varying missions. At DIR, we strive to always offer our customer agencies the choice of what would be best for their applications and ultimately, what would be the best value for Texans and the taxpayers of this state,” Crawford says.

Through the DCS program, public cloud use has climbed to 30% since 2017, with private cloud at 70%, Ward says. The program now serves 121 state and local government agencies and educational institutions, including 29 state agencies that are required by law to participate and 18 others that have joined voluntarily.

Agencies are increasingly adopting public cloud to modernize or build new applications, taking advantage of Platform as a Service and the ability to scale services up or down as needed, Ward says.

DIR offers four public cloud services to give agencies choice, because no two clouds are the same, she says. Their choices are based on the best fit for their application or their existing expertise.

“There are business and technology reasons why one platform would be better for a particular need,” Ward says. “It could be that an agency is an AWS shop or an Azure shop. That’s what they know, and that’s what they want to keep using.”

Modernizing Applications to Improve Public Services

The Office of the Texas Secretary of State uses DIR’s traditional data center services but has also adopted AWS, Azure and other public cloud services to modernize applications, says Dan Teczar, the office’s CIO.

“The economies of scale we achieve through DIR with the buying power of the state is a great resource, especially for a smaller agency like the Secretary of State’s office,” he says. “In addition to cost, we benefit greatly from the contract vehicles, services and expertise offered by DIR’s internal staff and vendor partners.”

The agency took advantage of DIR resources when it recently modernized its Texas Register and Notary Public applications in the public cloud, resulting in more streamlined business operations and better customer service, Teczar says.

The SoS modernized its 30-year-old Texas Register system, where agencies publish public notices and new rules, using a cloud-native, low-code platform hosted in AWS.

The new Texas Register application cut editorial preparation time by up to 75%, reduced security vulnerabilities by 70% throughout the agency and allowed the public to see rule updates almost immediately, Teczar says.

SoS also modernized its Notary Public software, making 95% of filings paperless and saving staff over 700 hours per month through automation.

Overall, public cloud services have enabled the Secretary of State’s office to pursue digital transformation that delivers faster, smarter services, Teczar says.

“By combining modern tools, inclusive engagement and relentless focus on public value, we are turning outdated processes into high-performing digital services that restore trust and reduce burden,” he says.

Scaling Resources Across Departments

Texas Health and Human Services (HHS), which provides IT services for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), migrated to the DIR DCS program in 2007 and began utilizing public cloud services in 2019.

DSHS chooses public cloud services based on individual application requirements, primarily using AWS (with a smaller presence in Azure), while also using DIR’s private cloud resources. Before the 2007 DCS migration, HHS mostly used on-premises data centers operated by the Texas Facilities Commission.

The DCS program’s public and private cloud services offer advantages over traditional data centers. Both cloud options use a pay-as-you-go model that can provide cost efficiencies.

Because the program’s management structure (which includes private cloud operations and the DCS public cloud manager) handles maintenance and updates, HHS IT staff have more time to focus on core business activities, an HHS spokesperson says.

“With the cloud platforms’ scalable, flexible and agile resources, HHS can quickly adjust capacity based on demand, make timely system changes and reduce downtime,” the HHS spokesperson says. “The platforms also offer higher performance, reliability, built-in disaster recovery, and tools and infrastructure for superior security controls.”

Building Data Center Services

To manage this hybrid environment, DIR has contracted with a multisourcing services integrator that oversees vendors and cloud companies and provides overall governance. DIR uses reference architectures to optimize cloud operations, ensuring each public cloud environment is deployed consistently and securely and meets industry best practices.

“Reference architectures are established to ensure standards and compliance. Customers don’t have to create them,” Ward says. “Health checks are run. Vulnerabilities are managed. All of this is tightly controlled to ensure that we minimize – as much as we can – the opportunity for a breach.”

Public cloud deployments include financial controls to prevent cost overruns. Agency leaders must approve projects and set cost limits. Agencies are notified if they reach a spending threshold, she says.

Previously, state agency leaders were reluctant to fully embrace public cloud, but these operational, security and financial controls have addressed their concerns, prompting increased adoption, Ward says.

To deploy public cloud services, agencies submit a ServiceNow ticket with their requirements, Ward says.

A vendor that serves as the state’s public cloud manager holds a joint application development session with the agency. The vendor scopes out the architecture, Platform or Infrastructure as a Service options, and storage requirements. The public cloud manager creates a cost proposal, and upon approval, spins up the cloud services and turns it over to the agency for testing and final sign-off, Ward says.

Agencies that want to use a private cloud go through a similar process. They submit a ticket with their requirements and automatically spin up virtual instances. DIR uses a variety of technologies in its data centers and most recently began deploying Dell PowerFlex hyperconverged infrastructure.

“It’s very much like what you would see in the public cloud: very easy and not laborious,” Ward says.

Texas’s shared services for public and private cloud offerings are a smart strategy that eliminates government waste, says IDC Analyst Ashish Nadkarni.

DIR’s use of reference architectures provides a standardized blueprint for implementing infrastructure and applications, which eliminates one-off implementations that can be costly and difficult to manage, and that could potentially create security vulnerabilities, he says.

“Creating a reference architecture makes it more cookie-cutter, makes it more scalable,” Nadkarni says. “It takes the guesswork out, streamlines implementation of services and eases the burden on administration and IT teams.”

Satisfying Statewide Demand

Ward expects the current 70-30 split between private and public cloud to even out slowly in the future, possibly reaching 50-50 in the next decade.

Overall, DIR’s IT leaders feel the state’s data center consolidation and mix of private and public cloud services have been successful. State, local and educational institutions spent $546 million in data center services in fiscal 2024, with 97% customer satisfaction, Crawford says.

The technical piece is huge, but change management and relationship management are also critical, she says.

“We hit 100% customer satisfaction for many months. But we did not start out that way,” Crawford says. “It came through a lot of hard work, and it continues to be a lot of hard work. We’re continually evolving our program, so that we can be ahead of the curve and meet the needs of where Texas is going and where technology is going.”

Technology Guide for State Agencies

The Texas Department of Information Resources serves as a technology guide, says Texas CIO Amanda Crawford, assisting agencies in their public cloud and data center initiatives. Those efforts include:

Innovation and testing at DIR’s Texas Innovation and Education Center, where agencies can text new technology in a secure lab to see if it’s a good fit for them

Education and training provided by DIR through conferences, webinars and education days

Dear Editor,

Is there time for climate policies to be political?

The evidence is there–melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather. Climate change is accelerating, but instead of taking action, we have attached party identities to the issues and are now facing the consequences of political polarization. Party issues create swings between administrations–these frequent reversals are what make our system of government unique.

But unlike some domestic policies where this ""swing"" can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

I graduated from high school this spring, and while I just began studying political science, I am no expert yet. Already in my lifetime, I have noticed environmental changes in Iowa: frequent flooding, record temperatures, and extreme storms.

That’s why I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a volunteer organization seeking bipartisan climate solutions through grassroots advocacy. CCL’s neutral approach bridges many perceptions and concerns about climate policies, and one opportunity to exercise this is through lobbying. Thanks to fundraising led by Northeast Iowa’s CCL Chapter Leader Leslie Sand and a generous grant from the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, I have had the opportunity twice now to lobby Iowa’s members of Congress for bipartisan climate action.

During meetings with Representatives Hinson and Feenstra and Senator Grassley, our focus was on the role of clean energy and the global ""clean energy race."" But policy compromise still felt out of reach because of a major national barrier: political parties. Political polarization has national leaders trapped in rigid agendas.

One reason for this could be because political identities have become a defining factor in political decisions and voting patterns through political polarization, both at an individual and party level, which encourage party-line votes. But another reason could be political pressure from party leaders or administrations to vote and act certain ways.

This is a big problem, especially for climate policies.

Climate policies are urgent, but as work continues to find bipartisan solutions, our leaders seem to be drifting farther apart.

Climate change does not care how you vote. It is our responsibility to remind our leaders to work together and prioritize bipartisan climate action. Despite divisiveness within our current political environment, I remain optimistic. My conversations locally and in D.C. have changed how I approach climate change, and I believe that by working together, we can protect our future

Participants will be joined by subject matter experts for a full day of policy discussions on Tuesday, October 7th, including a deep dive on RNG fleeting policy priorities, extending the $0.50/gallon Alternative Fuel Tax Credit, establishing a $1.00/gallon Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Fuel Tax Credit, and preserving RNG viability in EPA's regulatory programs such as the Phase 3 GHG Rule and the Renewable Fuel Standard. On Wednesday, October 8th, participants along with Transport Project staffers will be meeting on Capitol Hill to lobby Members of Congress and senior staff on industry issues.

Chuck Coppa, APG's CEO/CFO, will be representing APG along with multiple industry executives spanning vehicle and engine manufacturers, servicers, suppliers, fuel producers and providers as well as multiple industry trade organizations. Mr. Coppa will be discussing APG's practical, affordable, and proven alternative fuel solution to convert existing Class 8 diesel trucks with APG's vehicular Dual Fuel System. With no loss of power and torque, the Dual Fuel solution provides the ability to realize meaningful net fuel savings through the substitution of up to 60% natural gas including low-carbon and negative-carbon renewable natural gas. According to the American Trucking Association, 95.8% of all carriers operate 10 or less trucks and 99.7% operate 100 or less trucks which makes APG's Dual Fuel solution so appealing as we believe most fleets are either just hesitant of change or do not have the financial resources to completely swap out their entire diesel fleet for cleaner burning vehicles.

Mr. Coppa noted, ""Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, reducing on-road transportation related operating costs and emissions while using readily available cleaner burning domestic fuel sources should be a top priority and is an important step in America's goal of achieving energy dominance and independence. I am excited to represent APG alongside so many high-profile industry executives.""

Research over two decades has found “intractable” problems that have made carbon credits in most big programmes poor quality, according to the study. While the industry and diplomats have made efforts to improve the system, it found much-awaited rules agreed at a UN climate summit last year “did not substantially address the quality problem”.

“We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale,” said Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School and co-author of the study, in Annual Reviews. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed.”

Carbon offsets are a tool to cut emissions efficiently by crediting rich polluters for financing cheap climate action abroad while pumping out the same amount of planet-heating gas at home.

In theory, the practice could lead to lower levels of global heating by funnelling money to the places where it will do the most good as soon as possible. But voluntary carbon markets have long been plagued by “junk offsets” that overstate their impact.

The researchers said the worst problems were with issuing additional credits for projects that were already in the pipeline, such as building a windfarm that would have gone up anyway; impermanent projects, such as planting trees that later burn down in a wildfire; projects with leakage, such as protecting part of a forest but effectively pushing loggers elsewhere; and double-counted projects, such as restoring a peatland but letting the seller and buyer claim the drop in emissions.

“An offset may be robust on three of these four dimensions, but if it lacks in the fourth, it may represent a far lower emissions reduction than was credited – or no real reduction at all,” the study warned.

A meta-analysis published in Nature Communications last year found that less than 16% of the carbon credits investigated showed real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

The lead author, Benedict Probst, founder of the Net Zero Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, who was not involved in the new paper, said it provided a “valuable high-level overview of the well-documented problems plaguing existing carbon crediting projects”, despite not providing a critical appraisal of the underlying studies.

“This study echoes the main conclusions of our own research, but it provides a broader picture across the carbon crediting landscape,” he said.

Probst added that the study identified some of the root causes of over-crediting, such as information gaps, but warned of other systemic factors such as the small constituency advocating for high-quality projects, conflicts of interest when drafting standards, and “chronically understaffed” regulators.

There are efforts under way to clean up the market. In response to recent criticism, industry-led initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) have gone through the latest scientific research on which offsets are effective, only approving schemes that meet strict requirements. Separately, so-called “ratings agencies” for carbon offsets now provide buyers with information on whether offsets are likely to represent real-world emission reductions.

The review authors recommended urgently phasing out offsets that did not actively suck CO2 from the atmosphere and shifting the focus of offset markets to high-quality carbon dioxide removal and storage. Instead of financing other meaningful climate projects through carbon offsets, they called for a contribution-based scheme that did not allow donors to claim it negated their own emissions.

But they also found some types of projects that currently suffer from over-crediting could still be remedied, such as issuing cleaner cookstoves and capturing gas from landfill.

“We don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” said Lezak. “There are a couple of important domains where it is important to highlight success, or the potential for it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395b935b2a9343572a2440bcf535c0fac4d37e5c/281_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db06ef948976f5a39c505ae894309ce1",N,,2025-10-06 17:05:50.389567

The model, according to the LSU executive, Robert Twilley, could be the LSU Ag Center's and LSU Sea Grant's decades-old cooperative extension services.
""The key part of the extension service is that people live in these communities,"" Twilley said during the LSU Energy Research Symposium on Friday.
On Monday, Tara Smith, LSU executive associate vice president and director of the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service at LSU AgCenter, said she wasn't aware of a formal plan to implement the idea.
Hensgens asked if having the extension services step into the current ""messy"" energy debate would harm the trust people have put in the services.","Pumping and permanently storing carbon dioxide under vast stretches of Louisiana forest and farmland has triggered grassroots opposition, as the reality of more than 30 such proposed projects has taken hold over the past two years.

Companies proposing to convert hundreds to thousands of acres of farmland into solar farms have faced similar opposition from pockets of rural Louisiana, including in the state's sugar cane growing regions.

The ""energy transition"" that some officials and business leaders say has arrived in Louisiana is bringing uncomfortable change and conflict to a state with nearly 125 years of history with oil and gas.

During a recent energy symposium, a top LSU executive floated the concept of having the state's flagship university create a new cooperative extension service that could serve as an unbiased mediator and science-based information source on energy. The concept, however, may step into a potentially sensitive area for LSU, with some having previously raised concerns over whether the university has too close a relationship with the carbon capture and energy industries.

The model, according to the LSU executive, Robert Twilley, could be the LSU Ag Center's and LSU Sea Grant's decades-old cooperative extension services. LSU Ag Center includes the popular Louisiana Master Gardener Program.

Twilley, LSU vice president for research and economic development who formerly led the LSU Sea Grant program, said creating a cooperative extension for energy would match a trend happening in some other land grant universities to expand extension services beyond agriculture.

The cooperative extension services, which have the mission of bringing new research to the public, so the public can apply it, have a physical presence in all 64 parishes that could serve as the home for a new energy cooperative extension, Twilley suggested.

Combined with the recently formed LSU Energy Institute, the effort could tap into the university's expertise to address the multi-disciplinary questions energy raises and, Twilley argued, fulfill an obligation that a public research university has to serve as a trusted source of information.

'Informed, trusted agent'

Twilley told the forum audience that early discussions have occurred, including an idea, as a first step, to give agents an ""Energy 101"" class so they can field some questions and direct people to more expert LSU sources.

""The key part of the extension service is that people live in these communities,"" Twilley said during the LSU Energy Research Symposium on Friday. ""That's really critical because they're trusted individuals, and they are trained in how to actually deal with being the informed, trusted agent.""

On Monday, Tara Smith, LSU executive associate vice president and director of the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service at LSU AgCenter, said she wasn't aware of a formal plan to implement the idea.

Smith, who sat on the forum panel moderated by Twilley, said there would have to be ""a lot of future discussions"" at the ""highest levels to make something like that happen.""

Among those challenges, according to Twilley, is finding the people and money.

At the forum, he floated the idea of the U.S. Department of Energy providing the dollars to avoid the inevitable credibility questions industry funding might generate.

Other concerns existed for some. State Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, who attended the forum and grew up in a family of rice farmers, remarked on the credibility the agricultural extension service had with his grandfather.

Hensgens asked if having the extension services step into the current ""messy"" energy debate would harm the trust people have put in the services.

'Not take sides'

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies who has spoken at some community forums to provide information on carbon capture, has already faced criticism. Upton is also interim director of the new Energy Institute.

But Smith and another forum panel member, Rex Caffey, an LSU natural resource economics professor and director of the Sea Grant marine extension, explained they believed the cooperative model could stay above the fray.

""Our stock and trade is to get involved in controversial issues and the way we protect ourselves is to bring science-based information and to not take sides.

Today, more than 60% of independent repair shops experience weekly, if not daily, difficulties making routine repairs.
It restores balance by ensuring that independent repair shops and aftermarket parts manufacturers have access to the critical data needed to perform their jobs.","OPINION:

Americans don’t expect and really don’t want the government to run the economy. Instead, they hope it will create conditions in which jobs are created, wealth expands, and new businesses not only survive but also thrive.

Achieving this state has been one of President Trump’s primary objectives. So far, he has kept his eye on the ball. In his first term, he cut taxes, slashed red tape and put the interests of working Americans ahead of those of multinationals and money movers who had closely aligned themselves with Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden.

Mr. Trump’s second term began auspiciously, with the White House focused on securing favorable trade deals to enable American industry to prosper. Some in Congress, unfortunately, have other ideas and have kowtowed to well-heeled special interests at the expense of working men and women.

That must change, and Mr. Trump must take the lead. One of the American system’s significant innovations is the respect built into it for the individual’s right to property. It is mentioned in the Constitution, as the Founders believed the success of the nation rested in many ways on the ability of people to secure rights to the property gained through their labor.

After more than 200 years, the definition of property has expanded, and it now encompasses not only tangible things but also intangible ideas. The recognition and protection of intellectual property, the products of human thought, are even more critical now that the global economy runs as much on zeros and ones as it does on fossil fuels and ball bearings.

For some time now, what used to be referred to as “Detroit” has flexed its power in the marketplace and on Capitol Hill, pushing independent mechanics and parts suppliers out into the cold, leaving them unable to access the thousands of bits of information involved in fixing cars and trucks. It has created an auto repair monopoly for vehicle dealerships. The people who build our cars and trucks also want to be the only ones who can service them. From the free market perspective, that’s not fair.

A bipartisan measure making its way through Congress addresses the issue effectively. The REPAIR Act makes the distinctions necessary to protect the rights of innovators producing new products that are truly cutting-edge while preventing auto companies from using IP law to stifle competition from local small businesses that service vehicles and often serve as a gateway to the middle class for working Americans.

This is about the foundation of the U.S. economy. The vehicle supplier industry, which supplies the parts needed for vehicle repair, is the largest piece of the nation’s manufacturing sector. It involves more than 4.8 million Americans, mostly working-class individuals or small-business owners and operators. They’re also Trump voters whose interests are of great concern to the White House.

If Congress fails to step up, this economically essential network of manufacturers, mechanics and suppliers remains at risk. If current trends continue, by 2035, consumers could face additional costs of $34 billion on top of what they should be paying for car and truck repairs. Even now, they are paying the price.

Today, more than 60% of independent repair shops experience weekly, if not daily, difficulties making routine repairs. Just over half of independent repair shops report sending as many as five vehicles each month to a dealer for repair because of data restrictions imposed by “Detroit.” It’s a perversion of the concept of property rights, which means consumers have fewer options, face longer wait times and pay higher prices.

You would think that the restrictions might lead to safer vehicles on the road, but you’d be wrong. In testimony before Congress, Jonathan Morrison, named by Mr. Trump to lead the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, explained that the hoarding of data has a deleterious effect on the nation’s automotive fleet.

“The ability of vehicle owners to service and maintain their own vehicles, or have their vehicles serviced or maintained at the facility of their choice, is important to ensure safety,” he said, promising to support efforts such as the REPAIR Act that, in his words, “provide consumers with secure access to data necessary to maintain or service their vehicles.”

It’s not just about keeping the nation’s vehicle fleet running safely. It’s about what’s best for consumers. Independent shops can perform the same work as dealerships, just as well, if not better, for about two-thirds the cost. Forcing commercial vehicle operators to use the more expensive option by involving nebulous IP concerns drives up costs for essential goods and services.

This is precisely the kind of anti-competitive behavior the Trump administration wants to eliminate. Mr. Trump believes in free markets, intense competition and empowering the American worker rather than compromising with monopolistic entities that squeeze consumers and strangle small businesses.

That’s why the REPAIR Act is necessary. It restores balance by ensuring that independent repair shops and aftermarket parts manufacturers have access to the critical data needed to perform their jobs.

The Trump movement is about shaking up the status quo to deliver results. The REPAIR Act is a textbook example of how to achieve this, leading to lower prices, increased competition and support for jobs in America in an environment that promotes growth rather than protectionism.

The Trump administration moved to cut nearly $8 billion in projects from blue states.

PEORIA — Two Peoria-area manufacturers are set to lose millions of dollars in federal funds following President Donald Trump's move to cancel billions of dollars in energy projects, mostly in Democrat-run states.

Illinois was one of 16 states to have energy projects funding, totaling $7.6 billion, terminated last week by the Trump administration in a move that targets blue states during a government shutdown which Trump and his allies have pinned on Democrats. In total, Illinois will lose $752,301,434 in funding.

The project terminations, which were announced by Trump's director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought, will impact the Peoria area.

Caterpillar is set to lose a $3.2 million in U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood's district, while Komatsu is slated to lose $2.5 million in funding in U.S. Rep. Eric Sorensen's district.

Sorensen, a Democrat from Illinois's 17th District, said the projects, which were already appropriated by Congress, were designed to ""lower energy costs, create jobs, and boost American innovation.""

“This is a political stunt that puts working families last. This reckless decision means more than $54 million in lost investment that would have created good-paying jobs, supported clean energy technology, and kept our communities competitive,"" Sorensen said in a statement. “This isn’t about saving taxpayer dollars. The funding was already approved. This is about politics, plain and simple — and our families will pay the price.”

Vought, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, said in a statement on X that the projects were part of the ""Green New Scam"" and ""fueled the Left's climate agenda.""

Komatsu declined to comment for this story.

Caterpillar and LaHood's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sustainable energies and technologies has been a focus point of Caterpillar's in recent years following the launch of its ""Pathways to Sustainability"" program.

Under the electric power sustainable energy and technology section of its website, Caterpillar says: ""For Caterpillar, sustainability is not a new concept. It’s part of who we are and what we do every single day. From lower carbon intensity fuels to solar power, Cat Electric Power puts sustainability in action by delivering a wide range of power solutions that make your operations more efficient and help to meet your sustainability-related goals.""

Komatsu, too, according to its website, has made sustainability a focus in recent years and has even made a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

""At Komatsu, sustainability is not just a goal — it’s a fundamental part of how we do business,"" Komatsu's website says. ""We aim to create value through manufacturing and technology innovation to empower a sustainable future where people, business and our planet thrive together.""

Trump has routinely targeted programs and rhetoric focused on curbing climate change, including solar power and electric vehicles, during his presidency. While speaking to the United Nations last month, Trump called climate change a ""con job.""

“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said at the United Nations. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.

While lease prices have risen significantly, the company has maintained purchase prices for its vehicles unchanged.
This move highlights how the expiration of government subsidies can directly impact consumer costs in the electric vehicle market, even for industry leaders like Tesla.
The company’s decision to increase lease prices while keeping purchase prices stable creates different financial implications for consumers depending on their preferred acquisition method.
The expiration of federal incentives represents a significant test for the electric vehicle industry’s ability to maintain growth momentum without government subsidy support.","Tesla has implemented lease price increases across its U.S. vehicle lineup this week following the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits, directly passing the lost subsidies to customers. The Texas-based electric vehicle manufacturer raised monthly lease costs for its Model Y to a range of $529 to $599, representing increases of $50 to $70 from previous rates of $479 to $529. While lease prices have risen significantly, the company has maintained purchase prices for its vehicles unchanged.

The timing of these price adjustments coincides directly with the expiration of federal EV incentives, suggesting Tesla is responding to the changed economic landscape by shifting the financial burden to lease customers. This move highlights how the expiration of government subsidies can directly impact consumer costs in the electric vehicle market, even for industry leaders like Tesla. The company’s decision to increase lease prices while keeping purchase prices stable creates different financial implications for consumers depending on their preferred acquisition method.

Industry observers are now watching how other electric vehicle manufacturers in the United States will respond to similar market conditions. Companies like Bollinger Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: BINI) face similar decisions regarding how to manage the financial impact of expired federal incentives on their business operations and customer pricing strategies. The broader electric vehicle industry must now navigate a market environment without the federal tax credits that previously helped make EVs more affordable for American consumers.

This development comes at a critical time for the electric vehicle industry as manufacturers balance growth objectives with changing government support structures. Tesla’s pricing strategy following the subsidy expiration provides insight into how market leaders are adapting to reduced government incentives while maintaining their competitive position. The company’s approach of targeting lease customers for price increases rather than all buyers demonstrates a nuanced response to changing market conditions that other manufacturers may study closely.

The full implications of these pricing changes will become clearer as consumer response data emerges in the coming months. Market analysts will be monitoring whether the lease price increases affect Tesla’s market share or if consumers absorb the additional costs as part of their transition to electric vehicles.

What This Means for Data Center Developers Over the next several years, the structure of power procurement deals for data centers is likely to evolve significantly.","Over the last 18 months or so, the energy generation industry and its public utilities have been significantly impacted by the AI data center boom. It has been demonstrated across North America that the increase in demand for power, as driven by the demand for hyperscale and AI data centers, greatly exceeds the ability of the industry to actually generate and deliver power to meet the demand.

We have covered many of the efforts being made to control the availability of power. In response, utilities and regulators have begun rethinking how to manage power availability through means such as: temporary moratoriums on new data center interconnections; the creation of new rate classes; cogeneration and load-sharing agreements; renewable integration; and power-driven site selection strategies.

But the bottom line is that in many locations utilities will need to change the way they work and how and where they spend their CAPEX budgets. The industry has already realized that their demand forecast models are hugely out of date, and that has had a ripple effect on much of the planning done by public utilities to meet the next generation of power demand.

Most utilities now acknowledge that their demand forecasting models have fallen behind reality, triggering revisions to Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) and transmission buildouts nationwide. This mismatch between forecast and actual demand is forcing a fundamental rethink of capital expenditure priorities and long-term grid planning.

Spend More, Build Faster

Utilities are sharply increasing CAPEX and rebalancing their resource portfolios—not just for decarbonization, but to keep pace with multi-hundred-megawatt data center interconnects. This trend is spreading across the industry, not confined to a few isolated utilities. Notable examples include:

Duke Energy raised its five-year CAPEX plan to $83 billion (a 13.7% increase) and plans to add roughly 5 GW of natural gas capacity by 2029 to meet accelerating data center and industrial load growth.

Dominion Energy lifted its five-year capital plan to $50.1 billion, citing data centers as a primary driver while warning of potential rate pressure from grid modernization and capacity expansion.

NV Energy’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan explicitly models about 5.9 GW of bundled-service data center requests by 2033, supported by new gas, storage, and renewable additions.

Salt River Project (Phoenix) is advancing a mixed portfolio of peaking gas and clean capacity, including the Coolidge Generating Station Expansion—a 575-MW project approved and now under construction—with additional peak resources under review.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is moving forward on advanced nuclear for long-duration firming, including a BWRX-300 small modular reactor application for the Clinch River site, and a power purchase agreement with Kairos Power’s Hermes-2 test reactor expected to support Google data centers around 2030.

These CAPEX expansions fund both new generation capacity in the form of modern combined-cycle and combustion-turbine plants, nuclear pilots, and renewables, and grid-side investments to move bulk power to where data centers are locating. This demand is now an explicit planning driver in utility integrated resource plans (IRPs) and board approvals. It’s important to note that these investments encompass both generation and transmission infrastructure.

New Rate Designs and Risk-Transfer Contracts Shift More Responsibility to Data Centers

Utilities are retooling tariffs to protect existing ratepayers and de-risk megawatt-scale customers. With a goal of protecting consumer rate payers, a number of different tariff designs have been put forth.

The goal is to ensure that the cost of new capacity and infrastructure upgrades falls primarily on large commercial users - particularly data centers -rather than being spread across residential and small-business customers. Several new tariff structures explicitly define data center capacity obligations and cost recovery terms. Examples include:

New data center rate class: Dominion Energy has proposed a dedicated rate category for customers ≥25 MW with ≥75% load factor, featuring 14-year take-or-pay–style commitments to cover stranded-cost risk and ensure “full cost of service.”

Take-or-pay / minimum-take provisions: Duke Energy is pursuing minimum-take contracts (requiring payment regardless of utilization) and up-front contributions for network upgrades tied to data center interconnections—part of a broader shift toward “contribution in aid of construction” (CIAC) requirements.

Standby and curtailable service riders: Large-load customers are increasingly directed toward standby-generator and curtailable-service schedules to formalize flexibility. Dominion’s Schedule SG and Schedule CS are examples under their targeted sector programs.

The net effect of these evolving tariffs is that utilities are socializing less risk from speculative or timing-uncertain AI loads, while providing greater queue certainty for data center developers willing to shoulder their share of capital costs.

Changing the Relationship Between Data Centers and Utilities

A major shift is underway: load flexibility is becoming a formal part of interconnection agreements. New legislation and regulatory frameworks across multiple regions are requiring data centers to demonstrate the ability to adjust or curtail power consumption during grid stress events.

From on-site cogeneration and load balancing to demand-response participation and remote-curtailment capabilities, utilities and regulators are increasingly embedding flexibility requirements into contracts and permitting. Examples include:

Under Texas SB 6, ratified in June 2025: Beginning December 31, 2025, new large-load customers (≥75 MW) must be able to remotely curtail load or switch to on-site generation during emergencies. ERCOT will also begin procuring demand reductions from major customers. Interconnection agreements are expected to include fees, disclosure of backup power systems, and cost-sharing provisions as standard components.

PJM and SPP: Both grid operators are fast-tracking policies to curtail or manage large loads during scarcity events. The SPP “HILL/CHILL” framework establishes a 90-day expedited interconnection path when large-load customers pair with generation resources, defining curtailable service classes for planning and market participation.

Voluntary demand-response partnerships: To preempt mandatory curtailment mandates, some hyperscalers are signing voluntary flexibility agreements. Google, for instance, has reached demand-flexibility deals with Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to shift or reduce AI workloads during peak grid demand—an emerging model for bridging near-term capacity gaps.

Collectively, these developments signal a new era of active coordination between utilities and data centers, in which grid reliability, flexibility, and cost allocation are shared operational priorities.

Upgrading Power Transmission: Accelerate, Reconductor, Right-Size

Serving today’s multi-gigawatt data centers and campus-scale developments requires both new transmission lines and rapid capacity upgrades along existing corridors. With data center interconnection queues expanding across nearly every regional transmission organization (RTO), utilities and regulators are under pressure to streamline approvals and unlock capacity faster.

PJM approved $5.9–$6.7 billion in near-term transmission projects in 2025, explicitly citing data center–driven load growth and resource shifts as key justifications.

Advanced conductors: Google and CTC Global have partnered with utilities to reconduct existing lines using ACCC® (Aluminum Conductor Composite Core) technology, boosting transmission capacity in months rather than years. Priority is being given to reconductoring lines that unlock capacity for new data center sites.

Aggressive planning upgrades: PJM’s evolving Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) process aims to “right-size” near-term fixes for long-term needs. The DOE and NREL have identified Grid-Enhancing Technologies (GETs) such as Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) and topology optimization as practical, near-term pathways for unlocking transmission capacity without lengthy new-build timelines.

Federal rulemaking: Two FERC orders are reshaping how utilities and RTOs plan for both new generation and surging load growth:

FERC Order 2023 (2023): Requires cluster-based interconnection studies with enforceable deadlines and penalties, designed to reduce the interconnection backlog and expedite capacity additions.

FERC Order 1920/A/B (2024–2025): Mandates 20-year regional transmission plans, state involvement in cost allocation, and greater transparency, giving utilities a framework to plan around structural load growth driven by AI and industrial electrification.

Process innovation: SPP is implementing a 90-day fast-track path for “high-impact large loads” paired with new generation under its HILL/CHILL policy framework.

Together, these measures reflect a system-wide acceleration of transmission modernization, combining new lines, smarter planning, and digital tools to move power where AI and hyperscale demand is rising fastest.

Green Tariffs and “Bring-Your-Own-Clean-Power” Programs Are Changing How Data Centers Source Energy

Utilities are expanding subscription-based renewable programs and custom clean-energy constructs that enable data centers to meet sustainability and carbon-reduction goals within regulated tariffs. For large-scale operators, the challenge lies in navigating a fragmented landscape: each utility administers its own program, requiring project-specific power purchase agreements (PPAs) and regional tailoring to reflect local policy and grid conditions.

Examples of key programs include:

Duke Energy – Green Source Advantage (GSA / GSA Choice, North and South Carolina): Allows large customers to contract utility-backed renewable projects through long-term agreements. The program was expanded in 2024 to add new capacity and greater flexibility for participants.

Georgia Power – CRSP / CARES: The Clear and Renewable Energy Subscription Program offers 1,000–2,100 MW of utility-procured renewables for large-customer subscription. QTS Data Centers subscribed to approximately 350 MW under CRSP for its Atlanta-area facilities.

Dominion Energy – Schedule RG / Schedule CFG: Provides utility-sourced carbon-free and renewable energy options for large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. Schedule RG (approved in 2018) and the newer Schedule CFG (for projects ≥1 MW) are voluntary programs that allow customers to directly procure renewable generation through Dominion-backed assets.

A growing number of utilities are evolving from pass-through energy suppliers to active counterparties, developing or contracting clean-energy assets that are directly matched to data center load profiles. This integrated approach (where power buyers participate in generation planning) aims to improve efficiency, transparency, and reliability in how large loads source renewable energy.

Regional Utility Responses Are Diverging

Not all power generation, and not all regulatory response, is created equal. Across the U.S., states and regional transmission operators (RTOs) are adapting to data center–driven load growth in markedly different ways, reflecting local politics, resource mixes, and grid constraints.

Virginia (PJM): Data centers now account for approximately 25% of statewide electricity consumption, according to Dominion’s filings and state reports. Dominion’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and new large-load rate class proposals formally recognize data centers as the primary driver of load growth and cost allocation debates. Transmission capacity remains the chokepoint, making advanced conductor pilots and PJM’s RTEP expansion windows key to sustaining growth.

Texas (ERCOT): Senate Bill 6 (2025) effectively resets the social contract for large loads—requiring operators to flex or face emergency curtailment—and is expected to push wider adoption of on-site generation, energy storage, and hybrid PPAs. Other utilities and cooperatives across the state are expected to mirror ERCOT’s flexibility protocols in their own tariffs.

Arizona (SRP / APS): Rapid regional growth is driving a buildout of gas peaker plants paired with battery storage, alongside stricter queue management and prioritization. Salt River Project’s Coolidge Expansion exemplifies a reliability-first strategy, with clean-energy components layered in to support long-term decarbonization goals.

Midwest (MISO / Indiana): The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) has approved new large-load interconnection rules, while utilities such as Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) are signing demand-response agreements—including with Google—to mitigate peak load. Policymakers are advancing cost-sharing requirements for new generation supporting big-load customers.

SPP (Plains states): The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) is actively marketing the region to High Impact Large Load (HILL) customers through accelerated interconnection studies and firm/curtailable service classes, aiming to attract data center development away from saturated hubs like Virginia and northern Texas.

Regional differences in regulation and resource strategy are now shaping the geography of new data center investment, rewarding jurisdictions that can align policy agility, grid capacity, and clean-power availability.

What This Means for Data Center Developers

Over the next several years, the structure of power procurement deals for data centers is likely to evolve significantly. Utilities will increasingly require greater up-front financial participation from customers, shifting capital and risk onto large-load developers. Expect to see:

Contribution-in-aid-of-construction (CIAC) payments or similar up-front contributions to fund new substations, network upgrades, and capacity expansions.

Minimum-take or take-or-pay obligations to guarantee long-term revenue recovery for utilities.

Extended contract terms—typically 10 to 15 years—to secure capacity and protect other ratepayers from stranded-cost exposure.

Flexibility will become a baseline requirement. Interconnection agreements may now mandate curtailment capabilities, demand-response participation, and certified backup generation. In ERCOT, for example, new large loads ≥75 MW must be equipped for remote disconnection or on-site generation under Senate Bill 6 (2025).

Transmission-friendly regions will rise in priority for new site development. Locations within PJM subregions or along SPP’s HILL corridor, where reconductoring and RTEP upgrades can unlock capacity quickly, will gain competitive advantage as interconnection bottlenecks persist elsewhere.

Data center developers will also need to maintain ongoing visibility into utility and regulatory planning cycles, tracking updates from individual utilities, regional transmission operators (RTOs), and federal agencies such as FERC. Understanding how generation mix, transmission planning, and tariff reform interact will be essential to long-term siting and investment strategy.

In short, the path to power is becoming more capital-intensive, flexible, and policy-dependent, requiring data center developers to act as active partners in the evolving utility ecosystem.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/09/68cac843484992e78987ed82-gettyimages2194154654.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-06 16:04:19.116980

A new Rainey Center poll shows rare unity among voters as Americans agree energy and data must stay secure, independent, and powered by U.S. innovation.

The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

— Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

Concurrently, EOSE's implied volatility (IV30) climbed by nearly 11 points to around 120.24, anticipating a daily price fluctuation of $1.08, reflecting the market's expectation of substantial movement.

This options frenzy did not emerge in a vacuum but was the culmination of several strategic developments and market catalysts. The most immediate and impactful event was the announcement on October 6, 2025, of a strategic partnership with Unico. This collaboration is poised to enhance Eos Energy's storage solutions, promising improved performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby acting as a powerful catalyst for positive market sentiment. Earlier in the year, EOSE had already garnered attention with its inclusion in the Russell 2500 Growth Index, effective June 30, 2025, following successful capital raises in early 2025, including a $75 million common stock offering and a $200 million convertible senior notes offering, which bolstered the company's financial position.

Despite mixed financial results—missing Q1 2025 revenue expectations in May and Q2 2025 revenue expectations in August, while reaffirming an ambitious full-year 2025 revenue outlook of $150M-$190M—the company highlighted substantial manufacturing expansions and operational resilience. The appointment of John Mahaz as COO in August 2025 was also viewed positively, aimed at streamlining operations and supply chain efficiency. While some share offerings and insider selling in late September/early October and May 2025 raised concerns about potential dilution, the overall market reaction to the Unico partnership demonstrated a strong focus on future growth prospects.

The initial market reaction on October 6, 2025, was unequivocally positive. Following the Unico partnership announcement and the heavy call options activity, EOSE's stock price surged, trading up $1.25 to reach $13.85 during the day, marking a 9.9% increase. By market close, the stock had climbed an impressive 18.2% to $14.89. Share trading volume also dramatically increased to 22,625,168 shares, significantly exceeding its average of 11,675,751. This robust performance indicates that investors are placing substantial bets on EOSE's ability to execute its growth strategy, leveraging new partnerships and operational improvements.

Winners and Losers: Implications for EOSE and the Energy Storage Sector

The unusually high options trading activity in Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) and its strategic partnership with Unico present a clear potential win for EOSE itself. The immediate surge in stock price and overwhelming bullish sentiment in the options market reflect increased investor confidence, which can translate into easier access to capital for future expansion and R&D. The Unico partnership, focused on enhancing Eos Energy's storage solutions, is expected to improve product performance and cost-effectiveness, strengthening EOSE's competitive edge in the rapidly expanding energy storage market. This could accelerate the company's journey towards profitability, allowing it to better leverage its zinc-air battery technology to meet the growing demand for long-duration energy storage. However, EOSE must navigate the delicate balance of capital raises and potential share dilution, which has previously caused investor apprehension, to fully capitalize on this newfound momentum.

For the broader energy storage sector, EOSE's recent developments could be a bellwether. If EOSE successfully integrates the Unico partnership and scales its manufacturing, it could validate zinc-based battery technology as a viable and cost-effective alternative to lithium-ion for grid-scale applications. This success could attract more investment into long-duration energy storage solutions, benefiting other companies developing similar or complementary technologies. Conversely, companies heavily invested in alternative long-duration storage chemistries might face increased competitive pressure if EOSE's solutions gain significant market share due to improved performance and cost.

The event also highlights the dynamic nature of the renewable energy infrastructure market, where technological advancements and strategic alliances can rapidly shift market perceptions and valuations. Companies that are agile in forming partnerships, innovating their products, and demonstrating a clear path to commercialization and scalability are likely to be the winners. Those that lag in innovation or struggle with operational execution might find themselves at a disadvantage, especially as capital flows towards perceived market leaders.

While the Unico partnership is a clear positive, the financial health of EOSE remains a critical factor. The company's mixed Q1 and Q2 2025 financial results, despite reaffirming ambitious annual guidance, underscore the challenges of scaling an emerging technology company. Sustained operational improvements, successful manufacturing ramp-up, and eventually, achieving consistent profitability, will be crucial for EOSE to convert speculative options activity into long-term shareholder value. The ability to manage costs effectively and deliver on large backlogs will determine if EOSE can solidify its position as a leader rather than just a high-potential player.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Energy Storage Landscape

The dramatic options activity surrounding Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) is more than just a company-specific event; it resonates with broader industry trends and the accelerating global transition to renewable energy. The increasing demand for grid-scale energy storage is a foundational trend, driven by the intermittency of renewable sources like solar and wind. EOSE's focus on zinc-air battery technology, designed for long-duration storage, positions it squarely within a critical segment of this market, where lithium-ion batteries often fall short in terms of cost-effectiveness for extended discharge periods. The market's bullish response to EOSE's strategic moves signals a growing recognition of the necessity and potential profitability of these long-duration solutions.

The ripple effects of EOSE's success or struggles could significantly influence investment and development across the energy storage ecosystem. If the Unico partnership proves successful in enhancing EOSE's offerings, it could spur further innovation and competition in zinc-based and other non-lithium battery chemistries. This could attract more venture capital and institutional investment into emerging storage technologies, potentially diversifying the market away from its current heavy reliance on lithium-ion. Competitors, both established giants and other startups, will be closely watching EOSE's execution, potentially adapting their own strategies to either compete directly or explore complementary niches. For instance, companies like Fluence Energy (NASDAQ: FLNC) or Stem (NYSE: STEM), while focusing on different aspects or technologies, might see increased market attention on the long-duration segment they also serve.

Regulatory and policy implications are also significant. Governments worldwide are implementing policies and incentives to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including energy storage. Breakthroughs and successful commercialization by companies like EOSE can influence future policy decisions, potentially leading to more favorable tax credits, grants, or mandates for specific types of energy storage that demonstrate superior performance or cost advantages. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, for example, already provides significant incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment, which EOSE aims to leverage. A thriving domestic energy storage industry, bolstered by companies like EOSE, could further solidify national energy independence and security.

Historically, emerging technology sectors often experience periods of intense speculative interest, characterized by high options trading volumes and significant stock volatility. Comparisons can be drawn to early stages of the solar or electric vehicle industries, where companies with promising technologies saw rapid valuations, often preceding sustained profitability. While the underlying technology and market dynamics differ, the pattern of investor excitement driven by strategic partnerships and future growth potential, despite current financial challenges, is a common theme in disruptive industries. This suggests that while EOSE's current trajectory is exciting, it also carries the inherent risks associated with pioneering new technologies in a competitive landscape.

What Comes Next: Navigating Growth and Challenges

Looking ahead, the short-term focus for Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) will be on the successful integration of its strategic partnership with Unico and the tangible benefits it brings to product performance and cost. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming earnings reports for evidence of improved financial metrics, particularly revenue growth and progress towards profitability, which remain critical hurdles. The company's ability to effectively scale its manufacturing operations and fulfill its substantial backlog will also be a key indicator of its operational execution in the coming months. Any delays or setbacks in these areas could temper the current bullish sentiment.

In the long term, EOSE's trajectory will depend on its capacity to sustain technological innovation, achieve economies of scale, and establish a dominant market position in long-duration energy storage. The energy storage market is fiercely competitive, with both established players and new entrants constantly vying for market share. EOSE must continue to differentiate its zinc-air battery technology through superior performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Potential strategic pivots might include expanding into new geographical markets, diversifying its product offerings, or forming additional partnerships to strengthen its supply chain and distribution networks.

Market opportunities that may emerge for EOSE include capitalizing on the accelerating retirement of fossil fuel power plants and the increasing need for grid stability solutions. The growing demand for industrial and commercial energy storage, alongside utility-scale projects, presents vast opportunities. However, challenges such as intense competition from other battery chemistries (e.g., flow batteries, solid-state batteries), raw material price volatility, and the continuous need for significant capital investment will persist. Regulatory shifts and geopolitical factors could also introduce new complexities.

Potential scenarios for EOSE range from becoming a leading provider of long-duration energy storage, consistently delivering innovative solutions and achieving sustained profitability, to facing ongoing financial pressures if operational execution falters or competition intensifies beyond expectations. A mid-ground scenario could see EOSE carving out a strong niche in specific applications or regions, becoming a key, albeit not dominant, player in the broader energy storage market. The next few quarters will be crucial in determining which path the company is likely to take.

Also, let’s be clear: climate change isn’t a religion.
It’s science.
As in, 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity.","On July 28, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made a big announcement: the agency plans to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding. That might sound like something out of a Marvel movie, but it’s actually the cornerstone of U.S. climate policy. The Finding legally establishes that greenhouse gas emissions, from new motor vehicles, threaten public health and welfare. It gives the EPA the power to regulate these emissions not just from cars, but from power plants, factories, and other major pollution sources.

Without it? The EPA’s hands are tied when it comes to regulating emissions. This move raises eyebrows and questions, and the agency released a one-pager explaining their decision. We read it. We checked it. Here’s our fact check of their one pager HERE and here’s the highlights:

1) Making it Easy… or Not?

EPA Claim: “Through this reconsideration, EPA will give the public a chance to weigh in on the science, law, and policy choices at issue in the Finding”.

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: While the EPA says it’s opening the floor to debate, the federal government is cutting off the tools that make public comment more accessible; specifically, the API (Application Programming Interface) that allows people to submit comments through third-party platforms instead of directly through their Regulations.gov website.

In other words, yes, you can weigh in, but only if you go through the official portal, which many grassroots campaigns and advocacy orgs can’t easily access anymore. So it’s like being told you can speak… but only if you do it exactly the way they want.

2) Driving an Unbiased Dagger into our Hearts

Claim: “EPA cannot prejudge the outcome of this reconsideration process.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Okay, sure. But if the EPA isn’t prejudiced, why did Administrator Zeldin recently declare: “”We are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion…” That’s not exactly a “wait and see” kind of comment. That is clearly a judgment. Also, let’s be clear: climate change isn’t a religion. It’s science. Hard science. As in, 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity.

3) What is the Endangerment Finding & Why Does it Matter?

Claim: “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s overreaching climate agenda… That evasion ends today.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Let’s unpack this one, because it’s doing a lot of heavy lifting.The claim here is that the Endangerment Finding kicked off, “trillions of dollars of cost on Americans” and by rescinding it we will save $54 billion in costs annually. Funny how Zeldin doesn’t mention the real price tag Americans are paying: climate change-linked illnesses, death, and pollution-related diseases have been know for over a decade and some studies estimate they will cost the U.S. over $820 billion annually.

Also, those 2027 vehicle emissions standards the EPA now wants to reverse? They were projected to prevent 7.2 billion tons of CO₂ through 2055; that’s four times what the entire U.S. transportation sector emitted in 2021.

4) Duty to Regulate

Claim: “Massachusetts vs. EPA, held that the Clean Air Act’s general, Act-wide definition of “air pollutant” was broad enough to include carbon dioxide. Massachusetts explicitly did not hold that EPA was required to regulate these emissions from these sources.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: The 2007 Supreme Court ruling was very clear: greenhouse gases, such as excess carbon dioxide, are “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act. That means the EPA has a duty to regulate them unless it can show they DO NOT endanger public health or welfare. So unless Zeldin has some groundbreaking scientific discovery to share (spoiler: he doesn’t), the law still stands. The EPA still has a legal obligation to act.

5) By the Books

Claim: “The Endangerment Finding took an unorthodox approach… It never makes a straight-line conclusion that carbon dioxide from new motor vehicles is causing endangerment. It looked at this mix of six gases, from all sources over the world, … to determine that this mix contributed … an unknown amount above zero to climate change, and that climate change contributed … an unknown amount above zero of endangerment to public health. The Finding looked at U.S. vehicle emissions … and said that they were a big enough piece of the pie (some 4 percent of global emissions) to be “causing or contributing” to the mix of six gases—not to the endangerment itself.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: This one reads like a climate denialist word salad, but let’s chop it up. The EPA’s original Finding didn’t go rogue. It followed the law, the science, and the courts. It reviewed research from the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and U.S. agencies to conclude, based on overwhelming scientific evidence, six key greenhouse gases (CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆) collectively contribute to climate change.

Cars emit several of these, the most significant being carbon dioxide. That’s enough under the Clean Air Act. The law doesn’t require proof of direct causation by U.S. cars alone, just a finding that their emissions contribute to the problem. Which they very much do; in 2022, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. came from the transportation sector, the vast majority of which were from cars and truck emissions.

This whole “unorthodox” claim of government overreach is like saying a seatbelt is illegal because it wasn’t designed to stop every car accident. It’s just not how the law, or logic, works.

6) Massachusetts Still Stands

Claim: “These legal issues require fresh scrutiny, particularly in light of major Supreme Court cases… and new developments in science and technology.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Here’s where the EPA throws some legal spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. They cite recent Supreme Court cases, none of which overturn Massachusetts v. EPA.

Loper Bright Enterprises et al. (Loper) overturned the Chevron deference, which used to let agencies like the EPA interpret unclear laws, but not Massachusetts as the case clearly gives the EPA authority to regulate emissions.

West Virginia v. EPA didn’t question whether the EPA can regulate emissions; instead, it said the EPA went too far by trying to shift the entire power industry from coal to cleaner energy without clear permission from Congress. So while the majority in West Virginia may have been skeptical of Massachusetts they did not overrule it.

Also, is Administrator Zeldin seriously claiming that “new science” or “new technology” means we have to reconsider whether greenhouse gases are dangerous? That’s like arguing a better thermometer means we should rethink whether fire is hot.

In fact, the latest science only makes the case for greenhouse gases being the cause of climate change stronger. We’ve seen the impacts firsthand. The climate crisis is no longer hypothetical, it’s happening in real time. So using “technological progress” as an excuse to scrap foundational climate protections isn’t just misleading – it’s backward.

This so-called “reconsideration” of the Endangerment Finding isn’t about science. The Finding has been upheld, reaffirmed, and scientifically validated. What’s changed isn’t the evidence – it’s the EPA’s leadership. Want to make a difference?

The phaseout, brought on by the 2025 reconciliation law, hit the EV industry last week with the end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit last week he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5% after the tax credit ends from around 10% to 12% now.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller — way smaller than we thought — especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said. “We’re going to find out in a month.”

The tax credit rollback comes on top of the Trump administration’s revamp of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program created by the 2021 infrastructure law. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suspended the program in February, citing wasteful spending, and later relaunched with pared down standards.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said in a statement.

In an attempt to soften the blow, automakers Ford and General Motors Co. have plans to use their financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory, allowing the lending arms to qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.

Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and John Barrasso of Wyoming criticized the car companies’ plans, calling on the Treasury to close the automakers’ “loophole” and saying the plans are a “serious violation of Congressional intent.”

“These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off,” they wrote in a letter to the Treasury last week. “[IRS] guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.”

Despite automakers’ efforts to soften the hits to the EV industry, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an interview that the combination of the tax credit phaseout and rollback of other federal programs aimed at boosting battery manufacturing and production fares poorly for the industry.

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50% market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives. Now, she estimates it will be capped at 30%.

“It looks like the [auto] companies are going deeper into subprime, and that’s always an indication that sales in general are slowing … and they’re looking to keep the sales pace at a rate that allows them to maybe snowplow a little bit on total revenue,” she said. “We’ve seen several announcements now that these companies are delaying the product cycle for EVs.”

Renewables on deck

The 2025 reconciliation law also put new restrictions on renewable energy production and investment tax credits implemented under a 2022 reconciliation law, moving the timeline to qualify up by several years. Previously, projects needed to begin construction by the end of 2032. Now they must do so by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027, to take advantage of the federal support.

“This is an extremely tumultuous time,” said Bonnie Angermeier, senior legislative associate for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “There were promises made by the federal government, and there were strong signals for how they were going to support clean energy development.”

“Essentially, the rug got ripped out from under the clean energy industry,” she added.

Projects able to start construction before next July maintain eligibility for the credits for up to four years, Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said. SEIA is the national trade organization representing the solar and battery storage industry.

“The most advantageous position to be in right now is to qualify for that start of construction provision,” Gallagher said. “Companies that can’t qualify for that start of construction — they’ve got to get those projects online by the end of 2027, and so people are working hard to do that.”

Angermeier agreed, noting that companies focused on residential solar are at an even greater disadvantage.

“They have their pedal to the metal trying to complete projects as quickly as possible because they know that the window of that tax credit closes at the end of this year, which was highly unexpected and puts a ton of pressure on them,” she said.

She noted that the changes are “really throwing a wrench” into utility-scale projects as well, which generally rely on longer timelines to move from planning to completion. Some of those have been canceled as a result of the timeline shift, she added.

A solar markets report from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data and analytics for the renewables, energy and natural resources sectors, found that forecasts of new solar deployment through 2030 could be reduced by as much as 55 gigawatts as a result of federal policy changes this year.

Additional grant funding rescissions have also hit the industry hard as billions of dollars of previously allocated funds have been rescinded by the EPA, Department of Energy and other agencies, sometimes after they had already been dispersed.

Angermeier said the changes taken together have led to project cancellations, pauses, layoffs and the cancellation of new jobs that would have come with planned projects.

“We’re going to see a real restriction of new energy supply as a result of both the [reconciliation] bill and the and the administration’s action since the bill was enacted,” Gallagher said. “And of course, we’re seeing this restriction of new supply at a time when energy demand is booming.”

Wind and solar power have recently been among the fastest growing forms of new generation in the U.S., according to an August report from the Energy Information Administration.

While renewables are expected to account for much of the new generation forecast over the next two years, Gallagher said, “the outlook becomes a little bit hazier when you get out to ‘28 and ‘29.”

Even so, he’s not expecting a long-term chilling effect on the industry, because of continued market demand for renewable energy.

The Trump administration says it doesn’t take issue with renewable energy technologies, but with federal subsidies for them.

“Thirty-three years we’ve subsidized wind and solar power in the United States,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a late September press conference. “If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places.”

Wright and other officials say the administration prefers dense, baseload power that they say can respond to increasing energy demand. Wind and solar struggle with intermittency issues and are therefore less reliable than sources of power like natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, they say.

But supporters of renewable energy call that “hypocritical,” noting federal support for oil and gas projects. Renewables subsidies are “really more about creating an even playing field so that we can meet the demand that we have,” Angermeier said.

Gallagher called the administration’s arguments about reliability “tired,” citing the buildout of battery storage to support solar power.

“It was never really a legitimate criticism,” he said. “And it’s all the less so when we have energy storage that can deliver power reliably when the system needs it.”

‘The view from 200 years of history’ Nothing about the story of America’s public lands was inevitable, as Leshy makes clear.
That is partially because America’s public lands are — and have long been — very, very popular, he explains.
But overall Trump is zealously promoting drilling, mining, and logging on many public lands, he says.
Politics are not the only threat to public lands, Leshy cautions: “Climate change is altering how public lands are managed, bringing more species into jeopardy, changing how we manage forests for wildfire, and more — all with uncertain outcomes.","Last June, when United States Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, introduced a provision to sell millions of acres of public lands as part of the domestic policy package known as the “big, beautiful bill,” he might have anticipated pushback from environmentalists opposed to the plan.

Instead, some of the loudest critiques came from self-professed political conservatives — avid outdoorsmen who feared losing access to cherished grounds for hunting, fishing, and camping. Lee, who eventually abandoned the idea, may have been taken aback by the widespread resistance.

But not John Leshy ’69.

“Opinion polls bear this out, time and again: People love public lands,” Leshy says.

He would know. He has spent his life protecting and advocating for the more than 640 million acres of federally owned land in the U.S., first as an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in the 1970s, then as a top attorney at the Department of the Interior during the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and as a law professor and academic. In a 2022 volume, “Our Common Ground: A History of America’s Public Lands,” Leshy, who is now a professor emeritus at UC Law San Francisco, tells the comprehensive story of how this shared resource came to be.

Today, the U.S. government owns more than a quarter of the nation’s total land area, which is managed by four agencies: the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and National Park Service. From coast to coast, Alaska to Hawaii, this land contains some of the most stunning sights on earth: lakes and rivers, the tallest trees in the world, active volcanoes, caves, canyons, petrified forests, glaciers, and countless types of flora and fauna. Depending on the level of protection granted, some areas are also used for energy production, livestock grazing, or other kinds of resource extraction.

Beyond their sheer size, what makes the nation’s public lands particularly unique, Leshy says, is how accessible they are. “These lands benefit America and humanity in many ways. Generally open to all, for the most part today they are managed primarily for conservation, recreation, inspiration, and education. Every year they offer hundreds of millions of people life-changing encounters with nature, as well as activities that furnish an economic anchor for many communities.”

What Leshy’s book and career make clear is that the existence of America’s public lands is no accident — and it will take ongoing vigilance to ensure that they endure for generations to come.

“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution says we must have public lands. All it takes is an ordinary act of Congress to transfer every last acre out of U.S. ownership, even iconic treasures like the Everglades or Yellowstone,” says Leshy, who received the Harvard Environmental Law Society’s Horizon Award this year. “Each new generation must decide what it wants to do with its public lands.”

‘It pushed all of my buttons’

Leshy’s career began as something of a happy accident. Growing up in rural Appalachia, he spent a lot of time outdoors as a child, but environmental law was never on his mind. In fact, the field didn’t even exist when he was a student at Harvard Law School in the late 1960s, he says.

As a newly minted attorney, Leshy first went to work at the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, focusing on school desegregation cases. Three years later, having long dreamt of living in California, Leshy asked his best friend from law school if he might have any leads on a position there. By chance, the friend connected him with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Leshy helped them open their Western office and discovered his passion — advocating for public lands.

“It pushed all of my buttons,” he says. “It was nature, it was politics, it was interesting law, it was American history,” he says. “When I fell into it, I just decided that this was what I’d like to do with my life.”

Over the next three decades, Leshy worked on or led several historic efforts that expanded federally protected lands by hundreds of millions of acres. In 1977, he joined the Department of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, where he was part of the effort that produced a landmark law that safeguarded 150 million acres of pristine Alaska wilderness, more than doubling the size of the National Park System and tripling the size of the National Wildlife Refuge System.

Later, as the top attorney under Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt ’65 during Bill Clinton’s administration, Leshy oversaw a groundbreaking endeavor to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 — which gives the president the authority to create new national monuments — to expand protections on more than 5.5 million acres of Bureau of Land Management territory.

It was the first time the bureau had been given the responsibility to manage national monuments, which was, Leshy says, “a really important step because it manages the most land of the four major agencies, and this initiative laid the groundwork for future presidents to do the same,” such as Barack Obama ’91.

‘The view from 200 years of history’

Nothing about the story of America’s public lands was inevitable, as Leshy makes clear. “The breadth and character of this national asset are remarkable, considering that respect for private property and a distrust of government, particularly the national government, are baked into American culture and politics.”

Yet, from Ulysses S. Grant’s signing into law the establishment of the world’s first national park at Yellowstone, to Theodore Roosevelt’s vast expansion of publicly protected lands, to Richard Nixon’s signing of the law that created the Environmental Protection Agency, to the actions of Presidents Carter, Clinton, Bush, and Obama, American history is replete with stories of leaders and grassroots advocates from both parties acting to expand or protect this incredible resource, Leshy says.

That is partially because America’s public lands are — and have long been — very, very popular, he explains. “The view from 200 years of history shows the political system working the way it’s supposed to. It produced something the American public overwhelmingly supports.”

Leshy acknowledges that balancing demands for conflicting uses of public lands can be challenging, but he also says that there are ways of achieving these aims strategically without abandoning what makes America’s system special. “Resource extraction can be appropriate on some public lands, and existing law allows the Interior [Department] to sell or transfer parcels of land to state or local governments for various purposes such as affordable housing. That can be and has been done successfully in a small and measured way,” he says.

But in Leshy’s view, recent proposals to sell off large portions of federal lands are akin to “taking a meat cleaver” to the system. President Donald Trump has so far in this term not reduced the size of some national monuments, as he did in his first term, Leshy says, and also did not openly support Sen. Lee’s sales proposal. This, Leshy suggests, may mean Trump is paying some attention to opinion polls showing national monuments’ wide popularity. But overall Trump is zealously promoting drilling, mining, and logging on many public lands, he says. Some in the Trump administration, Leshy believes, are bent on disabling the agencies to try to convince the public that the federal government simply cannot manage the lands and therefore they ought to be transferred out of federal hands.

Politics are not the only threat to public lands, Leshy cautions: “Climate change is altering how public lands are managed, bringing more species into jeopardy, changing how we manage forests for wildfire, and more — all with uncertain outcomes. This is made worse because the Trump administration is hostile to the very idea that climate change is a serious challenge.”

A political success story

To Leshy, a career spent defending and expanding America’s public lands has been personally and professionally gratifying. But it has also helped illuminate an important American political success story that deserves more attention, he says.

“The vast majority of Americans love the fact that we’ve kept these lands, that they’re open to all, and are protected for future generations to enjoy,” he says. “It’s a ‘small d’ democratic thing, and I think that’s an important message, especially in these divisive times.”

Put plainly, he says, it shows that government can work. “There’s so much cynicism about Washington, D.C., and about how our political system is dysfunctional,” he says. “Of course, our government, like all human undertakings, has its flaws, but if we’re going to survive as a society, the political system needs to work. And the public lands show that it can produce a result people revere.”

Americans need to play their part for this success to be maintained, Leshy says. “Cynicism and apathy will change nothing. It is more important than ever for rising generations to engage with the political system that will determine their future, and that includes the future of the public lands.”",https://hls.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JohnLeshyB01-topaz-denoise-sharpen-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:05:23.804020

What Are Whole-Home Battery Systems?
More homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems to ensure they have access to power during emergencies.
Battery Systems are a Greener, Cleaner Alternative to Backup Generators While fuel-burning generators have been traditionally used for power backup during emergencies, battery systems provide a cleaner, quieter solution.","From California's wildfires to Florida's hurricanes, North America's aging power grid faces unprecedented strain. Millions of households now endure more frequent and prolonged blackouts — disruptions that leave families without lights, refrigerated medication or internet access when they need it most. In response, more homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems as a resilient, sustainable and cost-effective solution.

When wildfires ravaged Southern California earlier this year, Jason Bulquerin's neighborhood was plunged into darkness. He was safely away from the burning regions, but transmission lines delivering power to his area were destroyed by one of multiple fires tearing through Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and other parts of Los Angeles County miles away.

Despite this, the lights never dimmed at Bulquerin's home even as it took days for utility crews to restore service. That's because Bulquerin is among a growing number of Americans using the latest in battery technology to power lights, appliances and entire homes during blackouts due to grid instability and increasingly unpredictable weather, EcoFlow reports.

Why Blackouts Are Here to Stay: From Extreme Weather to Overloaded Grids

Extreme weather is no longer ""extreme."" NOAA forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, and power outages are expected to increase dramatically, with 13 to 19 named storms. Out of those, three to five could be major hurricanes. These aren't isolated events. In 2024, there were 27 confirmed disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to hit the U.S.

Compounding the problem is a power grid weakened by decades of neglect. Federal projections warn that without a major investment in energy infrastructure, power outage hours could rise 100-fold by 2030.

Making matters worse, demand is exploding — driven by AI data centers that guzzle electricity, electric vehicles plugging in by the millions and smart homes that never stop drawing power. AI alone could double U.S. electric demand by 2030, pushing an already overstretched system to the brink. The Electric Power Research Institute reports that data centers could consume 9% of the nation's electricity by 2030 — double their current usage.

What Are Whole-Home Battery Systems? Breaking Down the Technology

At their core, whole-home battery systems are simple: They store electricity (either from the grid or solar panels) and release it when the grid fails. But unlike the noisy, gas-guzzling generators of the past, they’re clean, quiet and nearly maintenance-free. When an outage hits, they switch on automatically, so you might not even notice the grid went down.

Today's systems come in three principal schemes, each tailored to different needs:

Modular, portable systems. These are ""build-as-you-go"" solutions. Start small, powering only essentials (fridge, lights, medical devices) and plugging devices directly to portable batteries. You can add more battery capacity later if you want to cover your whole home.

Panel-integrated systems. These tie directly into your home's electrical panel, so you can pick which circuits to prioritize and track energy use in real time via an app. No more tangled extension cords — just seamless power when you need it.

Solar-plus-storage system. Pair a battery with solar panels on your rooftop, backyard, or balcony, and you’re not just preparing for outages — you’re cutting your monthly bills, too. The solar panels charge the battery with free, renewable energy during the day, so you can use that power instead of buying from the grid.

Industry and government data shows how fast this shift is happening. The share of new residential solar installations including battery storage more than doubled in 2024, from less than 12% in 2023 to 28%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And in wildfire-prone California, the U.S. government reports the rate is even higher at over half as of last year, which includes 40,000 new systems installed between 2023 and 2024.

More homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems to ensure they have access to power during emergencies. While some backup systems don't require an associated rooftop solar system, many buyers pair battery and solar in order to maximize both their solar investments and their backup power duration.

Getting Word Out While Responding to Disaster

Whole-home systems aren't just protecting individual families — they're also making communities more resilient. Nonprofits that lead disaster response are teaming up with tech companies to turn these batteries into tools for collective preparedness and recovery.

Footprint Project, a New Orleans-based nonprofit focused on building disaster resiliency and response to weather events with green energy solutions, partnered with companies like EcoFlow to upgrade emergency response trailers from local fire departments with batteries and solar panels. These trailers can now roll into fire zones in California and hurricane-hit areas of North Carolina to power rescue tools and communications equipment.

In Canada, the Alberta Lions Emergency Response Team (A.L.E.R.T.), is also equipping itself with donated products to power microgrids for rescue and recovery operations.

Battery Systems are a Greener, Cleaner Alternative to Backup Generators

While fuel-burning generators have been traditionally used for power backup during emergencies, battery systems provide a cleaner, quieter solution. Smaller portable batteries can also be used in apartments and condos, whose tenants often cannot accommodate a generator. New products are also coming online to serve homeowners in need of whole-home load handling and flexible capacity systems.

Bulquerin, the California homeowner, said that since experiencing the extended outage during this year's wildfires, his neighbors have been looking to install backup batteries, including residents new to backup power or those wanting to upgrade from gas.",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/09/29/ecoflow-beyond-the-generator.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:06:07.829271

The 47-page complaint submitted in the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island centers on the ramifications of the yanked Solar for All grants for solar panel installation companies, labor unions, homeowners and nonprofit advocates.

“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities Congress intended these funds to benefit,” the complaint states.

The lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government and the Conservation Law Foundation, comes more than two months after the EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program. Originally included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act approved under the Biden administration, the $7 billion program aimed to help low- and moderate-income homeowners and renters access the benefits of solar panels — often too expensive or unfeasible otherwise — while advancing renewable energy use and creating jobs.

Funding was distributed in 2024 to state and local governments, nonprofits and tribal organizations nationwide, including a $49.3 million award to Rhode Island through the state’s Office of Energy Resources.

Rhode Island had spent $89,000 of its share — on employee costs for administration preparation — when the money was clawed back, Christopher Kearns, acting energy commissioner, said in an email Monday.

But development work was well underway, with the state agency in tandem with labor leaders and nonprofit partners intent on maximizing the benefits of its federal windfall. The five-year program was projected to help 900,000 households nationwide save $350 million annually on their energy bills while creating 200,000 new jobs and workforce training programs, according to estimates from the Biden administration.

RI AFL-CIO leads the charge

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, which represents 80,000 union workers in Rhode Island, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Union leaders helped Rhode Island plan and submit its application to the EPA seeking funding through the program, simultaneously creating and boosting workforce training and apprenticeship programs to prepare for the frenzy of new solar panel installations.

“Because of the requirement for prevailing wages and utilization of apprentices, the hope was that this would end up going to union contractors because we already pay prevailing wages and we always have professional apprenticeships in place,” Patrick Crowley, RI AFL-CIO president, said in an interview Monday.

Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, increased its staff by 20% — from eight to 10 attorneys — to focus on the state regulations governing solar energy and utilities in preparation for the federal grant, said Jennifer Wood, the center’s executive director.

The Center for Justice is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with a Georgia homeowner who had already applied for a free solar installation, and several businesses and nonprofits involved in solar panel installation, financing and education.

None of the plaintiffs were direct recipients of the Solar for All grants, but all stood to benefit from the funds awarded — and are now “significantly harmed” by the funding termination, the lawsuit states.

“By not having this program, it’s a lost opportunity for hundreds of jobs,” Crowley said.

Kearns, with Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Access issues

Wood lamented the time and resources spent training two new attorneys on the complexities of state utility proceedings that govern the incentives for and implementation of solar energy in Rhode Island. More consequential, though, was the loss for low-income Rhode Island residents already struggling to afford rising energy bills and unlikely to reap benefits of solar energy without the federal aid.

“There are a lot of questions around solar, how it gets implemented, how the infrastructure works, but for our clients, the question is, can they even get access to it at all?” Wood said. “Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”

The Trump administration’s opposition to renewable energy was clear on the campaign trail, and cemented as soon as he took office: halting offshore wind projects, yanking electric vehicle incentives, and freezing access to federal grants and loans for energy efficiency programs and solar panels, among others.

Federal budget cuts signed into law on July 4 canceled $16 billion of clean energy and emissions reductions incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, a move affirmed by an appeals court in D.C. on Oct. 1. But the federal budget cuts only applied to funds not already committed to specific projects or recipients – suggesting the Solar for All funding was preserved, according to the lawsuit.

It alleges that Zeldin ignored the congressional directive and its “unambiguous text” when he announced in a social media video on Aug. 7 that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program — violating the Administrative Procedures Act as well as constitutional protections for legislative authority.

The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats in Congress, including Rhode Island U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Gov. Dan McKee also denounced the news, accusing the Trump administration of “trying to undermine programs that support Rhode Island families” in a statement on Aug. 12.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” Amy R. Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, said in a statement Monday. “The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

The complaint asks a federal judge to force the federal administration to restore funding for the program, and declare its termination unlawful.

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in an emailed response on Monday.

None of the plaintiffs were direct recipients of the Solar for All grants, but all stood to benefit from the funds awarded — and are now “significantly harmed” by the funding termination, the lawsuit states.

“By not having this program, it’s a lost opportunity for hundreds of jobs,” Crowley said.

Kearns, with Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Access issues

Wood lamented the time and resources spent training two new attorneys on the complexities of state utility proceedings that govern the incentives for and implementation of solar energy in Rhode Island. More consequential, though, was the loss for low-income Rhode Island residents already struggling to afford rising energy bills and unlikely to reap benefits of solar energy without the federal aid.

“There are a lot of questions around solar, how it gets implemented, how the infrastructure works, but for our clients, the question is, can they even get access to it at all?” Wood said. “Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”

The Trump administration’s opposition to renewable energy was clear on the campaign trail, and cemented as soon as he took office: halting offshore wind projects, yanking electric vehicle incentives, and freezing access to federal grants and loans for energy efficiency programs and solar panels, among others.

Federal budget cuts signed into law on July 4 canceled $16 billion of clean energy and emissions reductions incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, a move affirmed by an appeals court in D.C. on Oct. 1. But the federal budget cuts only applied to funds not already committed to specific projects or recipients – suggesting the Solar for All funding was preserved, according to the lawsuit.

It alleges that Zeldin ignored the congressional directive and its “unambiguous text” when he announced in a social media video on Aug. 7 that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program — violating the Administrative Procedures Act as well as constitutional protections for legislative authority.

The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats in Congress, including Rhode Island U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Gov. Dan McKee also denounced the news, accusing the Trump administration of “trying to undermine programs that support Rhode Island families” in a statement on Aug. 12.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” Amy R. Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, said in a statement Monday. “The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

The complaint asks a federal judge to force the federal administration to restore funding for the program, and declare its termination unlawful.

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in an emailed response on Monday.

Leading experts have concluded that electricity supply is the most acutely binding constraint in expanding AI capacity and our current electricity production is woefully inadequate. The U.S. is seeing an electricity demand surge and needs every tool available to win in the AI race. American made solar and storage are the critical bridge technologies to get electrons on the grid for AI while other resources remain constrained.

The Department of Energy projects that electricity demand from U.S. data centers could triple by 2028, reaching up to 12% of our total U.S. electricity consumption. That growth is already showing up in utility forecasts, interconnection queues, power procurement contracts, and energy prices.

President Trump’s executive orders recognize this challenge and underscore a bold commitment to securing America’s leadership in AI and energy dominance. Delivering on the President’s mandate demands an all-of-the above energy strategy that deploys gigawatts of electrons quickly and builds on U.S. manufacturing supply chains. This is where American-made solar comes in.

In the past few years, the U.S. has reshored a domestic solar supply chain uniquely positioned to meet this moment. We can manufacture over 50 GW – roughly 50 nuclear power plants worth – of American made solar modules each year and the upstream segments of the supply chain are quickly scaling. American-made solar and storage is being used to power the next generation of AI, all while supporting over 40,000 American solar manufacturing workers.

American Made Solar Delivers Speed at Low Costs for Ratepayers

The timelines for AI energy buildouts are measured in quarters, not years. Long permitting and interconnection delays and supply chain bottlenecks are forecasted to delay the use of other generation sources. Utility-scale solar and storage projects can quickly come online in one to two years. AI data center business models depend on speed, and that energy deployment advantage is decisive. Utilities, energy developers, and industry analysts across the board have pointed to utility-scale solar and storage, combined with natural gas, as the near-term solution for meeting AI’s energy needs.

American Made Solar in the AI Pipeline

The deployment of solar from major utilities speaks for itself. Dominion Energy, the utility that serves Northern Virginia’s huge data center market, in its 2024 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) projects 6 GW of gas, alongside 12 GW of solar, 6 GW of offshore wind, and 4.5 GW of storage by 2039. Other major integrated utilities like Georgia Power and Duke Energy are taking a similar portfolio approach, with solar in the lead. The Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is deploying energy to the grid at a significantly higher rate than other markets, led by American made solar deployment. In the past two years, ERCOT decreased prices and increased reliability as it deployed massive amounts of American-made solar. As of January 2025, 28 GW of gas, 38 GW of wind, 153 GW of solar, and 165 GW of storage are active in ERCOT’s interconnection queue.

In its September 30, 2025 forecast (below), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) forecasts 92.6 GW of “high probability additions” solar will come online through July 2028, over four times that of any other resource:

All of the U.S. AI giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI are building out hyperscale facilities with solar. Two examples of U.S. solar manufacturing providing this energy for AI are instructive:

First Solar and the Orion Project

One of the clearest examples of what’s possible with American-made solar is the Orion Solar Belt in Buckholts, Texas. At around 900 MW, Orion is one of the largest solar projects in the country, and it’s designed to power Google’s growing data center operations in Texas. The project used First Solar’s U.S.-manufactured thin-film modules produced in Ohio, domestic steel, and American-made tracking systems. It is among the first large-scale energy projects to source all major components from within the U.S., demonstrating that America can deliver the scale, speed, and reliability that next-generation infrastructure requires.

And Orion is not an isolated case. First Solar’s customers are increasingly pivotal in ensuring that the surge in U.S. data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, can be matched by equally reliable U.S. energy supply. These are exactly the kind of projects that show how energy dominance and AI dominance go hand-in-hand.

Qcells and Meta’s Long-Term Supply Agreemen

In 2020, Qcells celebrated the commissioning of the 102.5 MW Bancroft Station Solar Farm in Georgia, developed to support Facebook’s Newton County data center. The project used more than 350,000 modules, manufactured at Qcells’ facility in Georgia, one of the largest solar manufacturing plants in the Western Hemisphere. In addition, Qcells is soon opening ingot, wafer, and cell lines in Georgia. For Facebook, and its parent company Meta, this partnership has always been about delivery certainty. With major data campuses coming online across the South and Midwest, Meta needed a supplier capable of producing large volumes of product in the U.S. States, on a predictable timeline, without the logistical challenges of overseas sourcing.

SEMA Members Are Built for Scale

First Solar, Qcells, and other Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition members are not just building solar components. They are building the bridge energy needed to support the AI energy demand and American energy dominance. This all supports good-paying American manufacturing careers, not just short-term construction jobs, from Louisiana to Ohio and Michigan to Georgia.

The future of American AI dominance depends on whether the country can build and deliver enough energy infrastructure to support it. That means embracing every tool that we have —and works fast. U.S.-made solar is one of the few tools that can be built fast enough and deployed widely enough to keep pace with this growth. This moment calls for clarity and coordination. If the U.S. wants to lead in AI, it must also lead in energy manufacturing, and that means not picking winners or losers. The tools are here, more factories are opening, and solar manufacturers are hiring. The question is whether America will seize the opportunity.",,N,,2025-10-06 22:00:42.264340

Tesla Inc. has once again captured the attention of investors with its third-quarter 2025 production and delivery figures, marking a significant rebound from earlier setbacks this year. The electric-vehicle giant reported delivering over 497,000 vehicles, surpassing Wall Street expectations and setting a new company record. This surge was largely fueled by a rush of U.S. consumers eager to capitalize on a $7,500 federal tax credit before its expiration, as highlighted in a recent analysis by CNBC. Production numbers also impressed, with more than 447,000 vehicles rolling off assembly lines, while energy storage deployments hit an all-time high of 12.5 gigawatt-hours.

Beyond the headline numbers, Tesla’s performance underscores its dominance in the EV market, even as competition intensifies from legacy automakers and newcomers alike. The company’s mass-market models, such as the Model 3 and Model Y, accounted for the bulk of deliveries, demonstrating sustained demand despite economic headwinds. Investors reacted positively, with Tesla’s stock climbing in after-hours trading following the announcement, reflecting renewed confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

The Catch: Sustainability of the Surge

However, this stellar quarter comes with a notable caveat: the boost may prove temporary. Analysts point out that the expiring tax incentive created an artificial pull-forward of demand, potentially leaving a void in the fourth quarter. As noted in a detailed report from The Motley Fool, while the deliveries represent fantastic news for shareholders, the underlying trends suggest caution. Tesla’s year-to-date deliveries are still down compared to 2024, and without similar incentives, maintaining this momentum could be challenging.

Moreover, external factors like weakening European sales and increased rivalry from lower-cost Chinese EVs add layers of complexity. Tesla’s energy division, however, offers a bright spot, with record deployments signaling strong growth in battery storage solutions for utilities and homes. This diversification could buffer against automotive volatility, but it remains a smaller revenue slice for now.

Investor Implications and Future Outlook

For industry insiders, these results prompt a deeper examination of Tesla’s strategic pivots. The company is betting big on autonomous driving and robotics, with upcoming reveals like the Cybercab robotaxi expected to drive long-term value. Yet, as Reuters reports, analysts anticipate the tax credit’s end to usher in a period of slower growth, with European weakness persisting into 2026.

Tesla’s ability to innovate and scale production will be key. CEO Elon Musk has emphasized cost reductions and efficiency gains, which could help mitigate demand fluctuations. Still, the quarter’s success, while impressive, highlights the fragility of relying on policy-driven sales spikes.

Broadening Horizons Beyond Vehicles

Shifting focus, Tesla’s energy storage achievements deserve equal scrutiny. The 12.5 GWh deployment not only sets a record but also positions the company as a leader in renewable energy integration. This segment grew robustly, outpacing vehicle delivery growth and contributing meaningfully to overall revenue, according to data from Tesla’s Investor Relations press release.

As global energy transitions accelerate, Tesla’s Megapack and Powerwall products could become pivotal. Insiders note that partnerships with utilities are expanding, potentially insulating the firm from EV market cycles.

Navigating Challenges Ahead

Despite the positives, challenges loom. Tesla faces regulatory scrutiny, supply chain disruptions, and macroeconomic uncertainties that could dampen consumer spending. The company’s stock, up 75% over the past year per Nasdaq insights, reflects optimism around future tech like Optimus robots, but near-term delivery trends will test investor patience.

In summary, Tesla’s Q3 triumph is a mixed bag—celebratory yet cautionary. For investors, it’s a reminder that while short-term wins boost sentiment, sustainable growth hinges on innovation and adaptability in a competitive arena. As the company prepares for its next earnings call, all eyes will be on guidance for the quarters ahead, where the true test of resilience awaits.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-a871ab5b-10c2-4c5f-91a1-1a6ff436be1e.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 20:01:58.739243

This 1978 quote attributed to cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world: indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has,” serves as a ‘north star’ for SACE’s work. Mead is describing what I call a catalytic community, people with passion and vision working together to change their world for the better.

SACE is a catalytic community: a community of people drawn to a vision infused with passion – that people can shape their future by changing the most fundamental choice a society makes: how we produce and consume energy. We refuse to leave this fundamental choice to major corporations that readily sacrifice our long-term health and well-being for short-term financial profit.

The Early Days: Activists Laying the Groundwork

In the late 1970s, a small group of dedicated individuals in East Tennessee came together to challenge the nation’s largest public power utility, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to listen to and be responsive to the people they serve. Calling themselves the Tennessee Valley Energy Coalition (TVEC), everyday citizens began organizing to speak truth to power. In the mid-1980s, TVA was a massive bureaucracy struggling to find a mission. Having tamed the Tennessee River, built an expansive electric power system, and ridden the growth of the midsouth, TVA had overbuilt its nuclear power program and was facing serious rate hikes on its power customers.

TVA’s massive size bred arrogance. TVEC empowered the public to hold TVA accountable to its public power mission. In 1985, TVEC gained official 501(c)3 status, laying the foundation upon which, over the next four decades, and with the work of many important players, we would eventually build the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

For Four Decades, We’ve Been Fiercely Committed to One Mission…

In the 1990s, TVEC was renamed the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition (TVERC) with a focus on reforming TVA planning and power choices. We successfully advocated for TVA to conduct public planning in the form of an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) that forced the utility’s planning assumptions and internal biases into the open. We have activists and passionate advocates who, in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, laid the groundwork for us to build upon.

Becoming SACE: Expanding Our Geography and Focus

Understanding and engaging utility planning upstream, before decisions harden and become virtually impossible to stop, has become and remains core to our mission. Climate policy, clean air advocacy, and promoting renewable energy became central to our mission in the 1990s.

In 1999, TVERC expanded its footprint beyond the TVA region and became the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), joining forces with other regional groups. Together, we demanded controls on air pollution that was endangering people’s health and threatening treasured places across our region while also promoting clean, renewable energy choices.

From TVA to the Southeast’s Fossil Fuel Industry

From the forested Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, our parks and beaches are diminished by electric power generated from fossil fuels, and our precious places are in peril. From cradle to grave, these fuels — coal, oil, and methane gas — have scarred our lands. Two of the largest fossil fuel industrial disasters in history have happened in our region: the massive coal ash spill at TVA’s Kingston, Tennessee, Fossil Plant in 2008, and the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster of 2010 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. These catastrophes took a significant toll on our people and the environment.

That same year, SACE celebrated its 25th anniversary, continuing our commitment to building a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment for everyone in our region.

SACE’s pioneering work in the late 1990s and early 2000s set the stage for growing clean, renewable energy, such as solar, wind, energy efficiency, and electrification technologies to counter these negative impacts from fossil fuels. We first worked with utilities to offer customers a clean, renewable energy choice (even if the customers had to pay a little extra for it in the form of utility green power pricing programs), and later moved to forcing those same utilities to recognize that solar, wind, and storage are the lowest-cost electric power generating choices and the cleanest and safest to deploy.

Going ‘All In’ On Electric Transportation

As we placed serious pressure on utilities to lower their carbon emissions and adapted our advocacy again, it became clear that transportation and mobility emissions would surpass utility emissions, which they did in 2016. After working on sustainably produced biodiesel, SACE went ‘all in’ on electric transportation and pushed utilities to produce clean, renewable energy for the grid, enabling electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce their emissions.

SACE has become a leading voice for expanding electric mobility options to all populations across our region. Today, our Electrify the South campaign is a leader in education and outreach, bringing folks together to gain real experience with electric vehicles through “ride and drives” and basic EV education. We have collaborated with local governments to secure electric school buses, thereby protecting children, while also partnering with utilities and local and state governments to prepare their infrastructure for the transition to electric mobility.

Standing On the Shoulders of Those Who Came Before Us

I must highlight the amazing people I have been blessed to work with and who have been the cornerstone of SACE’s success. First, the staff members of our organization have been outstanding. Their dedication, creativity, and grit in challenging some of the world’s largest energy companies never cease to amaze me.

Our Board has been a great source of wisdom and insight in some of our toughest battles while trusting our staff to lead. Our supporters, both large and small, have been great partners over the years, making us stronger and raising their voices with ours, allowing us to focus more on the work than on chasing money. These are the members of the catalytic community that are making the change happen.

Why We Do What We Do

The transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy is an ongoing battle, but it’s critical to ensure clean, safe, and healthy communities throughout the Southeast. We are finally seeing some real progress, especially as some of our regional utilities are beginning to truly scale solar by deploying amounts that counter fossil energy. It needs to happen faster, but the arguments in favor of the status quo and prolonging our reliance on fossil fuels grow weaker by the day.

Today’s accelerating climate catastrophes are the ongoing legacies of dangerous energy choices and a long-lived overreliance on coal, oil, and gas. These fossil fuels are the source of the polluting emissions that are raising sea levels and overheating our planet, resulting in increasingly intense climate disasters that are endangering the people and places we love. The massive destruction and tragic loss of life from Hurricane Helene in the Western mountains of North Carolina is but one recent example in our own region.

We are in this work because we know we can make a difference and shape our collective future. The severity of climate disruption can be overwhelming, and the shortsightedness and misinformation of corporate power, focused solely on financial returns, is maddening. However, clean energy technology is scaling at a pace never seen in human history.

Manufactured in the U.S., FUSION reflects AES and Maccor's commitment to quality, customer confidence, and constant innovation.

Battery Testing Demands Outpace Integration Capabilities

Battery testing demand is accelerating across electric vehicles, consumer electronics, aerospace, military & defense, and energy storage. Laboratories and manufacturers are under pressure to validate more cells, modules, and packs in less time to keep pace with innovation.

Yet traditional test setups slow progress. Teams often juggle multiple vendors, separate purchase orders, and weeks of on-site integration to have chambers and cyclers communicate. Compatibility troubleshooting and custom programming can stretch deployments from days into months, delaying critical product development timelines. FUSION solves these challenges by providing everything in one fully compatible module that is ready for immediate use.

FUSION: A Complete Integrated Battery Testing Solution

FUSION is more than a chamber and a cycler in the same crate. It's a fully engineered system where hardware, wiring, safety, and controls are designed, validated, and tested to operate as one. This pre-engineered approach gives customers confidence that their system will work seamlessly before it arrives on site.

Each FUSION unit includes:

Maccor battery cyclers

AES environmental chambers

(CNN) — Just a couple of years ago, America’s auto industry had visions of an all-electric future. It has since abandoned that talk after the Trump administration eliminated the federal government’s incentives for the technology.

The near future isn’t looking too pretty. The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs is expected to send sales plunging in the coming quarters and perhaps years.

But the global auto industry hasn’t given up entirely on EVs. Automakers are continuing to invest in an electric future — even if it’s not all-electric, as they had expected. The auto industry remains uncertain about the regulatory future of gas-powered cars in large parts of the United States as well as other markets around the globe. And they don’t want to fall too far behind China’s massive EV surge.

“They have softened their stance on an all-EV future,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “I do believe Ford, GM, Stellantis, and a lot of other automakers will still aggressively go down the EV path. But they’re more carefully going down the path than they were a few years ago.”

Sharply lower US EV sales ahead

The end of a $7,500 federal tax credit a week ago caused an EV sales surge during the third quarter as interested buyers rushed to grab a car before the discount expired. Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) all sold more electric cars than they ever had before, with GM in particular selling more than double the number of EVs in America than it had a year earlier. Tesla’s sales jump came after six straight months of declining numbers.

But after the sharp rise, EV sales for the rest of the year will likely come back to Earth with a heavy thud. And it’s unlikely they’ll get back up for a long time afterwards.

While a full 10% of all cars sold in the US in the last quarter were electric, Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month that he expects EV sales to fall to 5% of the US market, which would be down from about 7% of the market last year. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said that his company also expects that “EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously.”

Still placing big bets

But despite the gloomy outlook, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, a move it called its “next Model T moment,” a reference to the Ford car that helped introduce internal combustion vehicles to the mass market more than a century ago.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” Farley said at a recent company event.

Hyundai, also said it is not pulling back from its EV investment plans in the US market, even after immigration officials arrested 475 workers at one of its new EV and battery plants under construction in Georgia.

But Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stressed at a recent investor day event that the plant will be able to shift between building EVs and traditional gasoline powered cars more easily depending on market demand is part of the comapny’s plan.

Changing emissions regulations

Part of what forced automakers to shift to electric vehicles in the first place had been federal regulations from the Biden administration that aimed for EVs to make up 50% of the American new car market by 2030, and would have imposed steep penalties on automakers that didn’t hit the target.

Those regulations have been mostly rolled back under the Trump administration. The steep financial penalties for violating emission limits were also eliminated in the July tax and spending bill passed by Republicans in July.

California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – had also imposed mandates that would have essentially banned the sale of on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. Between them, those states account for about a quarter of US car sales.

But Congress recently moved to end California and the other states’ abilities to impose their own, stricter, emissions rules. That fight has been taken to federal court, and the battle could take considerable time to resolve – so much time that changes in administrations in the next decade could ultimately bring that ban back into place as soon as 2035. Europe and China are also moving ahead with their own stricter emissions rules that could force electric vehicle purchases.

Automakers were also chasing much higher stock prices with their EV plans. Tesla has a greater market cap by far than any other automaker, even though it sells only a fraction of the cars any of them do. That has been the case for years, even before CEO Elon Musk and the company’s fans on Wall Street started talking about its ambitious-but-yet-to-be-realized plans about robotaxis and robots driving up the value of the company in the future.

Gas cars ‘no longer a four-letter word’

Rather than going all-in on all-electric cars, automakers are focusing on hybrid–vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE).

“There’s still an aggressive push for EVs. But ICE is no longer a four-letter word anymore,” Ives said. “They’re going back to their roots.”

And America’s car companies are saying they didn’t see the same market demand for all-electric vehicles as cars powered by gasoline.

The regulations that had been in place under the Biden administration were “putting us in a box that would have ultimately resulted in a significantly smaller US auto industry, because we wouldn’t have been permitted to sell the internal combustion vehicles at anywhere near the volume we would have sold them,” GM CFO Jacobson said at GM’s investors presentation last month.

He said that, despite those regulations and support for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit, “customers weren’t adopting at the rate that the government wanted.”

But Jacobson said GM still sees longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit and other support for an all-electric future, and that the company is working to meet that growing EV demand.

“We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand,” he said. “That’s going to take a little bit of time. We’ll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.”

EVs remain attractive

Automakers also find EVs attractive for competitive reasons: It takes fewer hours of labor to produce an EV than it does a gasoline powered car – with its complicated engine and transmission – making them potentially more profitable for automakers than traditional gasoline powered cars.

And demand for EVs could start to increase again if the cost of producing EVs, especially the batteries that make up a large part of the cost of electric vehicles, continues to drop. And virtually every automaker is announcing plans for less costly battery technology.

As part of its $5 billion EV investment plan announced last month, Ford said it will soon sell an EV pickup for $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line to build that more affordable EV pickup is due to be up and running by 2027, Ford said last month.

And Ford still thinks the world is changing, even if it’s changing more slowly than people originally thought.

“We took inspiration from the Model T — the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2025/10/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWdmNXNrcHowMDFlM2I2bjJnNnV6b2kx-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZ2YwZmp1bDAwNzAyOHFvY3oxM2RuMG0.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:04:55.054385

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

Standing before the United Nations last week, U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed long-held animosity for the body dating back decades to when his company was apparently rejected for a renovations gig. Trump swore he would have delivered mahogany walls and marble floors to the tower. And now look at the state of the place, he grumbled. “You walk on terrazzo. Do you notice that?”

Something far worse than composite flooring is in store for nations that fail to rally to Trump’s hypernationalism, anti-immigrant fervor, and fawning embrace of fossil fuels. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said, apparently addressing his comments primarily to the “English-speaking world.” In a room filled with heads of state already reckoning with global warming as an existential threat, Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

He dismissed the decades of warnings about an overheating planet and the increasingly frequent and extreme weather events that the World Economic Forum has estimated are costing the world $16M every hour.

It was a do-as-I-say-and-as-I-do lecture, with Trump modeling a domestic climate response that can best be described as ecocidal. He is burning up the evidence of climate crisis while directly attacking renewable energy and other planet-cooling strategies that could keep more people safer the world over. This includes intentionally crashing climate-observing satellites, shutting down a Hawaii observatory that tracks atmospheric changes and a national climate monitoring network, closing federal environmental justice programs serving many of those most impacted by dirty fuels and climate disruption, curtailing federal assistance for disaster-struck communities, and more.

In the wake of the government shutdown, Trump just this week froze an estimated $26B in federal dollars for transportation and renewable-energy projects that had been headed to Democrat-led states, seeking revenge on Democrats who demanded that Republicans restore public healthcare services stripped in the federal budget bill.

Of course, dismantling federal research efforts and denying assistance does nothing to slow climate harms. Instead it both accelerates warming and puts more people at risk of harm. Teams rooting out so-called DEI initiatives during the opening months of Trump’s term have targeted climate efforts tied to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and clawed back $16B granted under the Biden Administration to help local communities fight climate change.

If anything, these attacks only prove the wisdom of initiatives undertaken in partnership with city and county governments and nonprofits, which aim to foster community resilience not only in response to climate destabilization, but also from potentially unraveling governmental support.

In San Antonio, Texas, for example, austerity measures in a tightening economy have already defunded two widely hailed efforts that are putting power—both literally and figuratively—into the hands of the community. But the project design and creative accounting born from legacies of distrust in government will likely see both efforts continue, even in the shadow of federal antagonism and potential local government retreat.

The ‘Beacon’ of Beacon Hill

Afew miles north of downtown San Antonio sits the Beacon Hill neighborhood, one of the earliest “suburban” neighborhoods for relatively affluent residents of a colonial city. Today it’s populated by older and often ornate single- and two-story homes in various states of repair, an area that has captured the attention of those looking for affordable housing as well as those looking to flip rundown homes at a profit. Its strength is in new and established residents, a vibrant homeowners association, and deepening social networks. In many cases, these are residents aware of the needs of their neighbors and already trained in disaster response.

Elizabeth Eichhorn, for instance, knows two businesses within walking distances whose owners have agreed to open as unofficial warming or cooling centers in the event of extreme temperature shifts. She knows who on the block has gas stoves ready and available to cook or purify water if the electricity is knocked out. She also knows which local business always has a minimum of 80 gallons of drinking water set aside for her block in case the water system fails. It’s information her immediate neighbors share also.

Such understandings arose from necessity starting in the hours after power failure during a 2021 winter storm. In February 2021, hundreds of thousands of residents across the city lost electricity, many for several days. Many others also lost water when the gas-powered generators at those water towers also failed.

Sarah Woolsey, founder of the nonprofit Impact Guild, which at the time operated a brick-and-mortar community center in the area, was soon helping residents stage a door-to-door response to the disaster.

“What happened over those next few days changed me,” she said. “Mostly it was neighbors that needed boiled water but also brought a dozen eggs over. It was this really cool few days of mutual aid with people showing up with what they had, and others needing things, and everybody needing things and receiving.”

That outreach taught her something else about her community. She learned that food insecurity was a daily reality for many before the freeze, with many already “hanging on by a thread,” she told Deceleration.

Beacon Hill has since become a showcase community for the City of San Antonio’s Climate Ready Neighborhoods effort, led by the City’s Office of Sustainability. Impact Guild is a key partner in a program that has intentionally put power into the hands of community by helping them first and foremost deepen their social relationships, identify their resources and talents, and negotiate in advance how they will support one another when disaster hits.

The neighborhood’s experiences in 2021 now inform some of the key literature being distributed by Climate Ready Neighborhoods as it seeks to activate “pods” across the city, neighborhood by neighborhood, teaching the power of interdependence at the level of the city block.

“It’s a matter of realizing that the city can’t be everything, so we have to figure out how to take our own responsibility,” Eichhorn told Deceleration. “Taking care of our neighborhood is shared.”

These neighbors weren’t passively waiting for someone in government to help them prepare for the extreme weather of climate change. They started that for themselves, years before the birth of the Climate Ready effort.

It was a natural shift for Eichhorn, who had lived in areas with frequent disruptions before. “I happened to live in Pasadena, California, where you have to learn to live with earthquakes and wildfires. Most every single person has a safety kit or recovery bag,” she said.

In the world of disaster response, the local—that is, the neighborhood—has long been recognized as a determining factor as to whether someone lives or dies in the aftermath of climate shock.

And that’s not lost on Beacon Hill’s City partners either.

“I think I’m really leaning into that aspect [of the project]. It’s just building up the community connections, the social capital, whatever you want to call it—get to know your neighbor and … build those systems,” said Kate Jaceldo, the City of San Antonio Office of Sustainability’s climate adaptation manager.

Even before the Trump administration started regularly rejecting calls for FEMA assistance and lurching toward dismantling the agency entirely, Beacon Hill residents were asking each other: “What can we do as a community?” Eichhorn said. “How do we connect with people who are already suffering? Let’s say they don’t have access to food, water, or shelter. How do we help with that?”

The summers of rising temperatures—and growing awareness of heat deaths in the city—has only validated the wisdom of those efforts. A recent assessment found the largest of the world’s capital cities are now experiencing 25 percent more extreme heat days than they were as recently as the 1990s. That heat is no surprise and likely to blame for more than 260,000 deaths since 2000.

“The human case for climate change adaptation is obvious,” write the authors of the cities study at the International Institute for Environment and Development. “That’s why city administrations should get the funding boost they need to work closely with communities, civil society groups, and health and other policy experts, on solutions to the growing heat problem.”

Gathering Heat Deaths

About 20 years ago, thousands of people died tucked away in their homes without adequate air conditioning or living on the street without access to a cooling center or home to retreat to.

“A week or so into the heat wave, city officials began running out of places to store bodies,” recounts Jeff Goodell, an Austin-based writer, in the online journal Yale360.

All told, nearly 15,000 died from the heat across France. The year was 2003.

Whether Paris, France or Paris, Texas, the heat has continued to rise virtually unabated as atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, continue to increase. In 2024, sustained daily temps of 108 degrees Fahrenheit, which Save the Children said was roughly 16 degrees more than the annual average, shut down schools for more than 30 million children across Bangladesh—for the second year in a row. More than 1,300 taking the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia died the same year after walking in daytime temperatures that ranged between 117F and 120F. In the United States, more than 1,000 heat-related deaths were reported while efforts to secure a federal heat standard for workers floundered.

Such “once in a hundred years” extreme heat events now “need to be expected every 2–5 years in most locations,” due to industrially driven climate change, recent research shows.

Heat-related deaths are just one obvious result of a hotter planet. Another are the sudden storms known as “cloud bursts”or “rain bombs,” which have wreaked havoc across India and Pakistan but are no longer unfamiliar in Texas. The link between climate change and flash flooding is easy to understand if we think of the atmosphere as a sponge. Because warmer air holds more water, climate change means a bigger sponge—and when it finally gets wrung, the accumulation can be disastrous.

This is how hundreds can be swept away in Kashmir in one day. It is how 12 inches of rain can fall in just a few hours in the Texas Hill Country and spark a flood that would ultimately claim more than 130 lives.

Texas this year didn’t blow past our recent summer scorchings, thankfully, although summer temps arrived early and have continued to run hotter than normal, well into the upper 90s, despite the arrival of fall. Around the world, temperatures recorded across land and sea continue to show an Earth moving deeper into unprecedented territory, with some of the hottest temps ever experienced by humans recorded in recent years. In spite of Trump’s slurs against the science, this has all played out as the decades of climate models said it would.

It is for this reason that Trump’s UN climate denialism prompted Ilana Seid, an ambassador from the island nation of Palau and head of the organization of small island states, to call the US reversal on climate under Trump “a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” a sentiment echoed by Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi, who said: “we are endangering the lives of innocent people in the world.”

Some long-committed climate activists see that betrayal too—and have started calling for local communities to take survival into their own hands.

‘Dagger in the Heart’

“It’s too late.”

This pronouncement about averting worst-case climate outcomes by Canadian scientist David Suzuki, also one of the world’s leading environmental activists, shook anyone paying attention to climate.

The basic science behind global warming has been understood since the late 1800s. Exxon’s own scientists understood at least since the 1970s that their products were changing the chemistry of the atmosphere, threatening to dangerously overheat the planet, and stating that humans had “a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”

Shell knew too. In the 1980s its scientists confirmed that “global changes in air temperature would … ‘drastically change the way people live and work.’ All told, Shell concluded, ‘the changes may be the greatest in recorded history,’” as the Guardian recounts.

It would take decades more before any tangible federal legislation advanced to tackle the problem. President Obama got behind a proposal known as “cap and trade,” which—for better or worse—aimed to use market mechanisms to wean the nation off fossil fuels. San Antonio’s Valero Energy helped beat that effort back, warning customers in pumpside placards of the cents it would add to the price per gallon. Another 13 years would transpire before President Biden advanced a federal vision of energy transition that sent an unprecedented hundreds of billions of dollars to the states to reduce energy demand and facilitate the transition to renewable energy and battery systems.

Now, with MAGA’s return to power, we’re facing what Suzuki experienced like a “dagger in my heart.”

Trump’s decision to prize the perceived needs of fossil fuel companies while demonizing and attacking lower-carbon alternatives—power sources credited with keeping the power on in Texas since its near grid collapse of 2021—has “flatlined” US climate pollution rates with an expected 7B tons of additional climate emissions over the coming five years, according to Carbon Brief. (Before Trump’s election, the same publication estimated he would inject 4B tons of emissions into the atmosphere and thereby push beyond reach international climate goals of limiting global warming beneath 1.5 degrees over 1990 levels.)

For those who had been warning for years of a “last call” on climate action, this policy lurch backwards within the largest economy on Earth dashed all hopes that we might avert the so-called “worst manifestations” of industrially driven climate change.

“Trump’s win was the triumph of capitalism and neoliberalism, and he’s going to wreak havoc,” Suzuki told Davis Legree at Canada’s iPolitics in July 2025. “For me, what we’ve got to do now is hunker down. The units of survival are going to be local communities, so I’m urging local communities to get together.”

While not surrendering the struggle to move beyond fossil fuels, Suzuki stressed that local adaptation efforts are now imperative, while citing the efforts of the Finnish government on emergency preparedness in particular.

“Governments will not be able to respond on the scale or speed that is needed for these emergencies, so Finland is telling their citizens that they’re going to be at the front line of whatever hits and better be sure you’re ready to meet it. … You’re going to have to inventory your community, and that’s really what we have to start doing now.”

In San Antonio, the Climate Ready Neighborhoods and another effort rooted on the South Side have been seeking to do just that. Both were defunded by San Antonio’s City Council under the new city budget, with funds from a recently established resilience fund diverted to pay local firefighters. However, the city’s Chief Sustainability Officer Doug Melnick said a week before the budget vote that these programs would continue through 2026 by drawing forward dollars from the previous year’s budget. After that, their future is uncertain.

“2025 dollars will be setting the stage for implementation through 2026,” Melnick told Council members at a budget hearing. “I think it will be a different conversation as we go forward into the future. But this year’s work … will continue.”

Withering FEMA

In South San Antonio, Fuerza Unida’s small office and clothing alterations shop is abuzz with climate activity. Maps on the wall denote zones to be planted with mid-sized trees, jobs for arborists are being advertised, and the last homes being gifted heat pump cooling systems are being checked off.

Although the role of fossil fuels tends to grab most of the attention in discussions of global warming, climate change is also a product of deforestation. Both are the targets of neighborhood-based climate work on San Antonio’s Southside, undertaken beneath the banner of the South San Heat Resiliency Project (PDF).

Here demographics dramatically shift from those of Beacon Hill. The per capita income drops significantly as the number of immigrant families rises. Homes here are mostly not yet buffeted by the waves of would-be gentrifiers prowling other quarters of the city. Instead they bake within the dust, heat, and fumes of ubiquitous scrap metal recyclers and auto salvage yards. Southside residents also persist on the edge of the former Kelly Air Force Base and its toxic legacy that many blame for high levels of cancer in the area, which claimed the lives of beloved community organizers Lupe and Robert Alvarado in recent years.

Led by a team of Latina workers who began collectively working to support local women after aLevi’s factory closedin 1990, Fuerza Unida (“united strength”) has served residents for more than 30 years. The city was never a partner here, said Nancy Parrilla, the organization’s chief financial officer. “[Fuerza] never saw them as an ally before,” she said.

A couple years ago, however, the organization was approached by the Office of Sustainability about a climate resilience project.

“The City came knocking on our door. We didn’t go looking for them,” Parrilla said. “They came and were like, ‘We need a stakeholder in the neighborhood’ because everything they had been trying had been unsuccessful.”

Community meetings followed that sparked interest among local homeowners, where temperatures in some homes—suffering from lack of insulation, cooling, and elevated street temperatures due in part to a lack of green space—routinely topped 100F degrees during peak summer. The effort began building trust and attracted the attention of Austin-based Adaptation International, which bills itself as a woman-owned business helping bridge the gap between climate science and community efforts.

Adaptation International’s work is intended to “identify climate vulnerabilities and develop sustainable cooling strategies that enhance resilience,” the organization writes on their website. “By integrating climate science with local knowledge, the project advances environmental justice and empowers communities to shape solutions through storytelling, research, and collaborative planning.”

This summer the effort was awarded an additional $96,000 from the nation-wide Climate Smart Communities Initiative.

While the project clearly emphasizes climate adaptation, it also promotes the language of “workforce development.” While similar projects have suffered elsewhere under Trump’s targeting of projects rooted in equity concerns, the inclusion of more favorable buzzwords has had no impact on the actual work, said Celine Rendon, a climate resilience specialist with Adaptation International. “That’s not really changing the way that we’re engaging with community members that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis,” said Rendon. “It’s not really stopping the work.”

While the San Antonio Office of Sustainability dodged layoffs this budget, colleagues working elsewhere, including for the City of Denver, didn’t fare as well.

Data released earlier this month by the U.S. Government Accountability Office suggests these sorts of community efforts will be more valuable than ever—especially as FEMA cuts back its operations.

Workforce reductions and loss of training capacity have severely compromised FEMA’s reliability as a partner in disaster response, GAO researchers write. FEMA’s slow mobilization to the July Hill Country floods that claimed more than 130 lives in a few days is well documented. But the GAO makes another fact clear: When the rain began to fall over Kerr County, only 15 percent of FEMA’s incident management workforce were available. That number was a mere 12 percent at the start of the year’s hurricane season, according to the GAO. It’s bad news as the country today moves through peak hurricane season.

As the GAO report concludes:

“Should the U.S. experience a similarly catastrophic peak hurricane season in September and October 2025, as it did in 2024, meeting response needs could be a major challenge. Moreover, no concrete changes to disaster response roles have yet been made. FEMA and other federal agencies spreading a reduced number of staff across the same or higher number of disasters nationwide could reduce effectiveness of federal disaster response for upcoming disasters.”

The government shutdown is not expected to further erode FEMA’s response capacity(such as it is). However: “If the agency required additional funds to respond to serious damage caused by a natural disaster during the shutdown,” Simmone Shah writes at Time, “they would be unable to appeal to Congress.”

Fuerza’s leadership say they have experienced the benefit of partnering with the City and Adaptation International. It’s allowed them to install cooling systems to homes in need. But it also kindled hope among their neighbors and helped them to imagine alternative positive visions of the future, the absence of which had been among the project’s “biggest challenges,” Parrilla said.

“I think the saddest part is that they don’t know that [the wealth] you see on the Northside, it’s because that’s what the city has invested in. And they can do the same over here. They have just chosen not to.”

But the program is being intentionally built to advance with or without a governmental partner. Meetings with fellow community-based organizations have increased. Skills and lessons learned are being shared.

Parrilla said the driving goal behind the heat pump installation project, of advocating for better controls over local sources of pollution, of an ambitious urban forestry project now offering neighborhood youth $18 per hour, is for the community to learn how to be sustainable on their own.

“We cannot depend on outside sources to keep our spaces green, to give us a safe environment,” she said. “When we leave it in their hands, we’re the ones who suffer.”

Adelante Juntos

Since the surge in heat deaths more than 20 years ago, the people of Paris, France, have put a tremendous amount of energy into responding to accelerating heat waves. A report from 2019 documents efforts to pull up pavement, plant thousands of trees, and cultivate networks of interlinked cool “islands” to help residents cool off.

The intentional greening of Medellín, Colombia was also recently cited as inspiration by a Bexar County commissioner, as another example of concerted city-scale efforts that have brought down temperatures for their residents in a time of overheating.

While San Antonio is putting more money than ever into “cool pavement” efforts this year, a practice with debatable results, there is also a burgeoning movement to green the city that is driven largely from the grassroots. Fuerza’s project is just one part of that. What participants in both city programs said they found most useful has been the power of deepening relationships with neighbors.

Some also referenced the skills of flexibility and creativity—about how to be prepared for rapidly changing circumstances—including positive ones, such as when new potential partnerships present themselves.

“There’s still funding and resources available,” said Rendon, “you just have to be strategic and make sure you are ready when it comes.”

In the world of adaptation under stress, partnerships deliver in different ways, added the Impact Guild’s Woolsey. Sometimes it is shared knowledge to help neighborhoods organize themselves, efforts that hinge exclusively on volunteer labor. Sometimes it is a check (whether from a public or private source) that facilitates purchases families couldn’t afford otherwise. Sometimes it is changing policies and large-scale infrastructure investments, which typically require massive public pressure on elected leaders.

“Just the way any ecosystem has a lot of biodiversity, our resources—the more diversity we have in them—the better off we are,” Woolsey said.

In recent weeks, Woolsey has been operating outside of San Antonio, helping families collect the things they need to return to homes abandoned after July’s Hill Country floods. There too, she has found that some of the most valuable assistance is low cost, she said. It is more about organizing and time. “There’s a lot that we’re sourcing that’s in-kind. We need dollars to close the gaps to get people into their homes,” she said. “But also it’s the shared meals, it’s the volunteer hours, it’s people giving the furniture.

“The bigger question we are all holding is like: How can [resilience] be the manpower showing up for one another? … How can it be physical sharing of resources that are more this barter/exchange kind of thing? Then when can it be the dollars, as strategically as possible, to close the gaps where those other things can’t do it?”

Far from the image of social breakdown so often depicted in Hollywood blockbusters, every disaster survived deepens a community’s knowledge of itself. It reinforces and strengthens the relationships people can actually rely upon. Each disaster is also “shared seeds,” Woolsey said. And the lessons that are reaped from those seeds often point toward something new, those interviewed told Deceleration. Lessons that point to deepening and rooting further in place, in belonging, in neighborhood—as the old world, oftentimes literally, washes away.",https://texassignal.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/utility-disconnections-campaign-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 15:09:28.189366

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration's termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program's termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.""

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,"" formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump's assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

Lawler’s silence is ironic considering that just last week, he penned an op-ed touting his passion for an “all-of-the-above energy approach” that “build[s] on existing clean energy investments.”

Late last year, Lawler also visited the same IBM research center that was just hit with millions in funding cuts – boasting at the time that he wouldn’t “stop working in Congress to empower our innovators.”

But now that Donald Trump has decided to gut these clean energy projects, it’s crickets from Mike Lawler.

Politico New York: The good, the bad, the ugly: Federal cuts come to New York.

New York is getting whipsawed by the Trump administration’s aggressive cost-cutting strategy.

About $467 million is being cut from clean energy projects in New York as part of the Trump administration’s Wednesday announcement it would slice about $8 billion in Department of Energy grants in mostly blue states, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s calculations.

It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.","Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

Just months after its founding in January, the company went public last week, sparking strong investor demand despite its early-stage status and lack of revenue. Shares surged 55% on their first trading day to close at about $32.50 per share, well above their $21 initial offering price, although they have since declined to levels of about $28 per share currently. Fermi’s market reception highlights surging investor appetite for artificial intelligence infrastructure plays. For a company with no revenue and no operating history, the frenzy around its debut raises the question: what exactly are investors betting on?

Reinventing Data Center Power for the AI Era

At the core of Fermi’s strategy is Project Matador, also called the “HyperGrid,” a hyperscale data center campus in the Texas Panhandle. The company’s model revolves around leasing massive data center space and integrated computing infrastructure to customers such as AI developers, cloud providers, and semiconductor firms. Unlike traditional data centers that depend heavily on strained public utility grids, Fermi plans to embed its own private power supply.

It will operate a mix of natural gas plants, nuclear reactors, solar farms, and battery storage—creating a grid-independent, highly reliable system designed for energy-hungry AI workloads. Fermi brands this approach as HyperRedundant, promising uninterrupted delivery even if the public grid falters. Project Matador is expected to generate 1.1 gigawatts of power by 2026, with a long-term goal of 11 gigawatts and 18 million square feet of space by 2038. For context, CEO Toby Neugebauer claims the site could eventually produce twice as much electricity as all the power plants currently serving New York City.

This ambition reflects the massive energy demands of AI. Training a single large model can consume as much electricity as hundreds of U.S. households annually. As models grow larger and are retrained more often, data center infrastructure must scale dramatically and remain highly reliable, since even brief power interruptions can disrupt AI research and cloud services.

Considerable Risks

That said, the outlook comes with considerable risks. Fermi has no operating history and remains pre-revenue, with construction still in progress. Its plans require massive capital – an estimated $50 to $70 billion over time, including $30 to $35 billion just for nuclear capacity. Financing, construction, and regulatory hurdles remain considerable and a project of this scale could face supply chain bottlenecks, labor shortages, volatile debt markets, and lengthy approval processes for nuclear reactors. Besides this, customer risk adds another layer of uncertainty.

So far, Fermi has signed only nonbinding letters of intent, with no firm tenant contracts. Without binding agreements, demand and cash flows remain uncertain. Finally, demand risk lingers – data center leasing and power revenues depend on broader economic conditions and the pace of AI adoption. While demand appears very strong right now, a slowdown in the pace of advancement of AI tech could hurt long-term growth rates.

In summary, Fermi represents a highly speculative investment opportunity. Valued at approximately $17 billion, the company aims to address AI’s enormous power demands via one of the most ambitious private energy projects ever conceived. That said, the recent stock surge reflects strong investor enthusiasm for the potential of its vision, rather than demonstrated operational success. The company benefits from the credibility and strategic advantages offered by its founders, including former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which may support regulatory, financing, and policy efforts. This makes the stock a very high risk, high reward type play at the moment.

The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

The DOE's review followed a May 2025 Secretarial Memorandum that established a new policy for evaluating financial awards, particularly targeting those ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration."" The DOE specified that 26% of the terminated financial awards, valued at over $3.1 billion, were issued between Election Day and Inauguration Day.

The terminated awards originated from several DOE offices like Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and Fossil Energy (FE).

The decision has ignited significant political controversy, with critics accusing the Trump administration of using the cuts as a political weapon against ""blue states."" White House budget director Russell Vought was explicit about the political nature of the cuts, posting on social media about ""Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,"" and listing the 16 states targeted, all of which voted for the Democratic candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

Among the highest-profile cancellations is the funding for California’s Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES), a major hydrogen hub project that had been projected to support up to 220,000 jobs. U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Adam Schiff, both from California, called the cancellation ""shortsighted,"" warning it would undermine economic opportunities.

Other affected projects include a $500 million award for the Lebec Net-Zero project in California, aimed at producing carbon-neutral cement, and an $87 million grant to Sublime Systems for low-carbon cement manufacturing in Massachusetts, which was expected to create between 70 and 90 jobs. The cuts also hit major grid and transmission initiatives, including a proposed $464 million in funding for transmission studies across seven Midwest states.

Critics argue the cancellations will result in the loss of tens of thousands of potential jobs, raise consumer electricity costs, and undercut U.S. competitiveness in critical clean technologies, despite the administration's stated goal of boosting American manufacturing.

The SEC go-ahead means that the stock exchange is gearing up to begin trading in early 2026, according to a news release, joining the sprawling avenues of big-name Fortune 500 companies in Dallas.

The nickname “Y’all Street” — a southern riff on Wall Street — came about in early 2024, after Dallas was named the No. 2 city in the country for financial jobs, second only to New York, according to Bloomberg. Financial big names are flocking to the city: In 2020, Charles Schwab moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Dallas; Deloitte plans to open an expanded new campus there this year; and a $500 million Goldman Sachs facility is in the works.

The growth in financial-sector jobs in the Lone-Star state since 2019 was more than six times the growth in New York and the nation as a whole, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2024.

So is it time to take Y’all Street seriously? Here’s where it stands.

Can Dallas become a financial rival to New York?

Texas Stock Exchange’s founder and CEO James Lee said in a press release last week that the exchange is ready to lead Texas’ pro-business environment.

“Real competition for corporate listings in the United States has finally arrived,” Lee said.

Major national stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange appear to see TXSE as a potential rival: NYSE announced it would move its Chicago branch to Dallas two weeks after the Texas exchange filed for SEC approval in January, the Dallas Morning News reported. Nasdaq also announced in March that it would be opening a new headquarters in Dallas.

And the TXSE’s financial backing is nothing to scoff at: the exchange boasts $161 million in funds from Blackrock, Charles Schwab, and other banking giants, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Republican leaders push back at “woke” stock markets

Republican politicians have also celebrated the promising development of the Dallas-based exchange — and are using it against Democratic rivals.

President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post Saturday about the New York attorney general Letitia James, said that her policies would make few companies want to use the New York Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ.

“The new Texas Exchange will be taking ALL of this business away,” Trump wrote.

Texas Republicans such as Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz shared similar sentiments about the new stock exchange’s potential as an alternative to the New York exchanges.

“If you don’t want a woke stock exchange, and just want an avenue to raise capital, Texas will be the place to do it,” Cruz wrote on X Wednesday. Cruz accompanied the post with a clip of himself on the Fox Business show suggesting that New York politicians, such as mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, were driving business leaders from their state to Texas.

Building momentum: What’s next for TXSE

Texans will have to wait until the end of 2026 to see if “Y’all Street” can truly rival Wall Street. TXSE indicated it will go live at the beginning of the year, with corporate listings in the second half.

The success of the exchange — which will be fully digital — hinges on companies deciding to list themselves, as well as the health of the state’s economy, Sriram Villupuram, a UT Arlington associate professor of finance, told the Texas Tribune. He said that interested investors will be watching closely to see how quickly TXSE can attract its first 50 to 100 companies.

“It gives those that are thinking about listing an idea about what it takes to get on the exchange, and it could snowball from there,” Villupuram said to the Tribune.

Along with the increase in companies moving their headquarters to Texas, the stock exchange could mean something big for Texans.

“What it means for local people, of course, is job creation,” Kirti Sinha, a University of Texas at Dallas assistant professor of accounting, told the Dallas Morning News.",https://thebarbedwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-485990710-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:03:48.300195

⛔ SHUTDOWN

If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again and hope for a different outcome:

The Senate is back in town today with another chance teed up to end the government shutdown. Government funding votes are lined up for this afternoon, but no one expects a different outcome from last week.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told House lawmakers to stay home for another week, knowing the stalemate will continue. Though, Johnson also told House Republicans they would get a 48-hour heads-up if they need to return earlier. “The House did its job,” Johnson argued on Sunday because it passed a government extension, directing the blame to the Senate.

A sign this could drag out for quite some time: President Trump is staying out of it. However, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports that “Trump may come under more pressure to negotiate with Democrats if the shutdown drags beyond Oct. 15, the date when members of the military will miss their first paycheck due to the fight in Washington.”

🪖 STATE WATCH

Portland and Chicago are fighting back:

President Trump’s efforts to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Portland, Ore., against state and local officials’ wishes hit a major snag late last night.

Let me start from the beginning: U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term,blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from sending federal troops to Portland.

The Trump team then tried to send out-of-state troops from Texas to Portland. Immergut then blocked the administration for the second time in two days — and this time, she strongly rebuked Trump as being “in direct contravention” of her order.

Why does Trump think federal troops are necessary?: To quell the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests.

Chicago is also fighting back today: This morning, Illinois and Chicago filed a lawsuit to block Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. Read more

💡 For context on the National Guard: “National Guard forces — largely part-time troops who typically work in civilian jobs full time — are normally under the control of the states, with governors serving as commanders. The troops are often deployed to help after natural disasters or when civil disorder overwhelms local law enforcement authorities, but in some circumstances federal law allows the president to take control of them.” (NYT)

Industries operating without valid permits or violating their permit conditions risk more than financial penalties.
Oteng’s message to AGI members suggests the EPA recognizes that many industries treat permit renewals casually, allowing documents to lapse while continuing operations.
As carbon markets develop, industries will face additional reporting and compliance obligations beyond traditional environmental permits.
Industry association gatherings reach concentrated audiences of decision makers who control permit compliance at their respective facilities.","Industries that fail to renew environmental permits on time will pay three times the standard fee as penalties, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has warned, signaling stricter enforcement of compliance requirements under Ghana’s new environmental legislation.

Samuel Oteng, Greater Accra East (Tema) Regional Director of the EPA, delivered the stern message during the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) Tema Regional annual meeting held recently. His warning comes as the EPA exercises expanded regulatory powers under the Environmental Protection Act 2025 (Act 1124), which replaced the 1994 legislation in January.

Speaking at the meeting themed “Creating a Conducive Business Environment for Industrial Competitiveness: 24 Hour in Perspective,” Oteng emphasized that permit conditions aren’t optional suggestions but legal obligations carrying real consequences. He revealed that violations of permit conditions and failure to renew before expiration attract sanctions, indicating the agency’s determination to enforce compliance.

The EPA director specified that industries must begin the renewal process at least three months before their permits expire, with late renewals attracting penalties equivalent to three times the applicable fee. This timeline requirement aims to prevent last minute rushes and ensure continuous regulatory oversight of industrial operations.

The warning reflects broader changes in Ghana’s environmental regulation landscape. Act 1124 established the EPA with significantly expanded powers compared to its predecessor legislation, giving the agency more tools to monitor and enforce environmental compliance across industries.

Industries operating without valid permits or violating their permit conditions risk more than financial penalties. The EPA can suspend operations, revoke permits entirely, or pursue legal action depending on the severity and nature of violations. These enforcement mechanisms existed under previous law but gain sharper teeth under the 2025 Act.

Oteng’s message to AGI members suggests the EPA recognizes that many industries treat permit renewals casually, allowing documents to lapse while continuing operations. This practice creates regulatory blind spots where industrial activities proceed without current environmental oversight or updated conditions reflecting operational changes.

The three month advance renewal requirement addresses this problem by building buffer time into the system. Industries that begin renewals three months early can resolve documentation issues, address any concerns the EPA raises, and ensure continuity without gaps in permit coverage.

However, the triple fee penalty for late renewals raises questions about proportionality and business impact. For industries operating on tight margins, especially smaller manufacturers, a threefold increase in permit costs could represent significant unplanned expenses that affect operational budgets.

The EPA appears willing to accept this criticism in exchange for stronger compliance incentives. Previous penalty structures apparently failed to motivate timely renewals, leading officials to conclude that financial consequences needed escalation to change behavior patterns across the industrial sector.

Environmental permits serve multiple purposes beyond bureaucratic box checking. They establish baseline expectations for emissions, waste management, resource use, and pollution control specific to each facility. Regular renewals allow the EPA to update these conditions based on technological advances, environmental science developments, or changes in community conditions surrounding industrial sites.

When permits lapse, the EPA loses this regulatory touchpoint. Industries continue operating under outdated conditions that may no longer reflect best practices or adequately protect surrounding communities and ecosystems. The renewal process isn’t just administrative paperwork but rather ongoing environmental management.

Act 1124’s expanded scope includes new regulatory frameworks that didn’t exist under the 1994 legislation. The law establishes the Ghana Carbon Registry to promote carbon credit trading and climate action, implements strict pesticide controls, tightens hazardous waste regulations, and restricts electronic waste imports. These additions increase complexity for industries navigating compliance requirements.

The legislation also creates the Carbon Markets Office hosted by the EPA, giving the agency responsibilities in emerging climate finance mechanisms. As carbon markets develop, industries will face additional reporting and compliance obligations beyond traditional environmental permits.

AGI members attending the Tema meeting heard Oteng’s warnings within broader discussions about creating conducive business environments under the government’s 24 hour economy policy. This context highlights tensions between environmental regulation and industrial competitiveness that define much of Ghana’s development debate.

Industries argue that excessive regulation or enforcement burdens competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors regionally or internationally. Environmental advocates counter that proper regulation protects public health and ecosystems while establishing level playing fields where all competitors meet minimum standards.

The EPA’s stricter enforcement approach tests whether Ghana can balance these competing interests effectively. Too aggressive enforcement risks driving industries toward non compliance or relocation. Too lenient enforcement allows environmental degradation that undermines long term sustainability and public health.

Oteng’s public warning serves notice that the EPA intends to use its expanded powers under Act 1124. Whether industries respond with improved compliance or pushback against perceived regulatory overreach will shape how effectively Ghana implements its new environmental protection framework.

The AGI meeting provided an appropriate forum for delivering this message. Industry association gatherings reach concentrated audiences of decision makers who control permit compliance at their respective facilities. Oteng’s appearance signals the EPA views industry engagement as important even while warning of tougher enforcement.

Seth Twum Akwaboah, AGI Chief Executive Officer, has emphasized that industries need stable, predictable regulatory environments to plan investments and operations effectively. The EPA’s clear communication about permit requirements and penalties arguably serves this goal by eliminating ambiguity about expectations and consequences.

How industries actually respond to the triple fee penalty threat remains to be seen. Some will likely prioritize compliance to avoid financial exposure. Others might gamble that enforcement won’t match rhetoric, particularly if they perceive the EPA lacks resources for comprehensive monitoring across all permitted facilities.

The EPA’s enforcement capacity represents a real constraint on how effectively warnings translate into changed behavior. Ghana’s regulatory agencies historically struggle with limited budgets, insufficient personnel, and equipment shortages that hamper their ability to monitor compliance comprehensively across regulated sectors.

Act 1124’s expanded mandate increases these capacity challenges. The EPA must now oversee carbon markets, strengthen pesticide control, manage hazardous waste more strictly, and enforce electronic waste restrictions while continuing traditional environmental permitting and monitoring responsibilities. Whether the agency receives corresponding budget and staff increases will determine implementation effectiveness.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-10-06 16:03:32.481880

(CA-06) condemned the Trump Administration’s revocation of a $50 million federal grant awarded to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for its Connected Clean PowerCity® project, a major initiative to modernize the electric grid and help the Sacramento region reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.
SMUD has received $8 million in reimbursements for work already completed, but the loss of grant funding disrupts the planning and execution of the project.
“This is a reckless and vindictive decision that punishes Sacramento County families and slows our progress toward a cleaner, more reliable energy future,” said Representative Bera.
### NOTE: This release is amended to reflect that the Connected Clean PowerCity® project will continue despite the loss of federal grant funding.","Sacramento, CA — Today, Representative Ami Bera, M.D. (CA-06) condemned the Trump Administration’s revocation of a $50 million federal grant awarded to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for its Connected Clean PowerCity® project, a major initiative to modernize the electric grid and help the Sacramento region reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Funded through the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program in 2023, the grant aimed to reduce outages, empower families to manage their energy use, and build a cleaner, more reliable energy system. SMUD has received $8 million in reimbursements for work already completed, but the loss of grant funding disrupts the planning and execution of the project.

“This is a reckless and vindictive decision that punishes Sacramento County families and slows our progress toward a cleaner, more reliable energy future,” said Representative Bera. “This funding was secured through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to modernize our grid, lower energy costs, and strengthen our resilience in the face of climate change. Pulling the plug now abandons a bipartisan commitment to smart energy policy and puts local jobs, innovation, and community preparedness at risk.”

The cancellation is part of a broader effort by the Trump Administration to withhold and cancel clean energy funding from blue states. On October 1, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced the termination of $8 billion in energy projects, specifically targeting 16 Democratic-led states. That same evening, the Department of Energy confirmed it had canceled 321 previously awarded grants. These terminations will increase energy costs, eliminate jobs, and weaken grid reliability across the country.

With the grant now canceled, Sacramento County will lose out on major investments that would have:

Installed 200,000 next-generation smart meters across the region;

Deployed advanced grid and outage management systems to reduce blackouts during extreme weather;

Added 22,500 intelligent load control devices to help manage demand during emergencies;

Expanded fiber optic infrastructure to improve communication and data reliability;

Partnered with the Wilton Rancheria Tribe of Miwok Indians to support solar, storage, and electrification on Tribal lands.

For ITC Holdings Corp., the nation’s largest independent electricity transmission company headquartered in Novi, Michigan, careers in energy transmission aren’t just about powering communities — they’re about empowering people. Crain’s Content Studio sat down with Charles Marshall, President of ITC Michigan, and Andrea Gurcsik, ITC’s Director of Total Talent, about the growth in career paths.

Q: Energy is essential to everyone’s daily life. What makes transmission such a reliable and steady part of that picture?

Gurcsik: Transmission infrastructure is really foundational to the energy system. Unlike other sectors that rise and fall, our work is less impacted by market fluctuations. As demand for energy rises, we continue to expand.

Marshall: Stability also comes from the long-term visibility we have into projects. Many take seven to 10 years to develop, so we know the work will be there. ITC has been a growth company for the past 22 years, and we anticipate that to continue for the foreseeable future. Growth brings stability — and frankly, it’s more fun to work for a growing company.

Q: What excites you most about this moment in the industry?

Marshall: The pace of change. Our grid has never been fueled with the resource mix we have today. Just four years ago, solar barely registered; now it’s 10 to 15 percent of the daily portfolio. That kind of shift brings new challenges and new opportunities.

Gurcsik: Employees feel pride and purpose in powering communities. Our engagement scores—world-class according to Gallup—show how strongly people connect to our mission. And innovation is part of our DNA. We have an innovation charter that says ideas can come from anyone, anywhere. Whether it’s a small process change or transforming the grid, being open to innovation and change is part of who we are.

Q: You’ve both emphasized culture. What makes ITC’s workplace different?

Marshall: When people come here, the first thing they often say is, “this feels different.” There’s genuine satisfaction and fulfillment in working at ITC. That culture of belonging is what sustains us. Years later, that feeling remains and is why so many of our employees stay here for the majority of their career.

Gurcsik: Every company says they put people first, but we have the results to prove it — top engagement scores, very low turnover, and leadership that stays close to employees. From welcome lunches to open coffee chats, employees feel supported and heard at all levels of the company.

Q: Charles, you’ve spent your entire career at ITC. What has that meant for you?

Marshall: I’ve worked at ITC throughout my entire career, but I’ve had the chance to reinvent my career multiple times. I’ve moved through engineering, regulatory affairs, stakeholder relations and executive leadership. That’s possible because ITC values curiosity and empowers people to thrive. If you’re willing to learn and grow, doors open.

Q: What career opportunities exist for those looking to join ITC?

Marshall: We’re a technical organization, so many of our employees are engineers. But we also need people with communication skills, perseverance, and the ability to build relationships.

Gurcsik: Beyond engineering, we’re hiring in finance, IT, HR, project management and more. If someone brings transferable skills, curiosity, and collaboration, we can find a place for them.

Q: How are you preparing the next generation of talent?

Gurcsik: Most people get into the energy industry because a family member is in this field. So, exposure is critical. That’s why we run a robust internship program and partner with local schools, such as the Henry Ford Academy. Students get to see how transmission keeps the grid stable—and how meaningful their contributions could be.

Marshall: Showing students opportunities in the energy industry before they set their course in college helps them see this field as a viable and exciting career path.

Q: What advice would you give someone considering a career in energy?

Marshall: We need strategic minds with ambition, creativity and adaptability. Those qualities matter as much as technical expertise.

Gurcsik: Stay curious. Be willing to embrace change and ask why. Those traits make a lasting impact—and they make you a great fit at ITC.

Eaton provides hydraulic, fuel, oxygen, fluid and air conveyance, electrical, motion control and engine solutions, as well as aftermarket service and support, for commercial and military aircraft.

“Our investment in North Charleston demonstrates our commitment to serving our customers and the communities where we live and work,” said Armando Tellez, President, Eaton’s Fuel and Motion Control Systems. “The expansion in North Charleston will enable Eaton to add machining, assembly and test capabilities and expand our existing additive manufacturing capability to support a key customer’s accelerated delivery schedule on a new program win.”

Eaton will build a new facility adjacent to its existing facility in North Charleston. The expansion will increase the company’s capability in additive manufacturing, machining, assembly and testing to support a new program win and increase capacity and readiness for future program wins. The new facility will produce complex hydraulic pumps and motors serving U.S. commercial and defense aerospace platforms.

Operations are expected to be online in 2028.

“We are thrilled that Eaton has continued to find success in South Carolina and is expanding once again with an investment of $46 million,” said Governor Henry McMaster. “With the creation of 50 new jobs, this announcement is a great accomplishment for both the company and Charleston County.”

South Carolina’s Coordinating Council for Economic Development approved job development credits related to the project. The council also awarded a $125,000 Set-Aside grant to Charleston County to assist with the costs of site preparation and building construction.

“Eaton’s expansion in Charleston County underscores the strength of South Carolina’s business environment which is conducive for a company’s long-term success,” commented Secretary of Commerce Harry M. Lightsey III. “We are pleased Eaton chose to further its legacy in our state with this notable investment in the Lowcountry and congratulate the company on this announcement.”

Tikvah Health And Wellness Grows In Charleston County

Earlier in September, Tikvah Health and Wellness (Tikvah), a health engagement platform, established operations in Charleston County. The company’s investment will create 13 new jobs over the next few years. Operations are already online.

“Our launch in Charleston County positions us to accelerate education and expand access to functional and integrative medicine across the region,” said Tikvah Health and Wellness CEO David Thedinga. “This is about improving outcomes, reducing costs and delivering a model of care that restores hope in health for employers and employees alike.”

Tikvah’s platform allows self-insured employers to integrate natural and functional medicine into their healthcare plans. The company connects employees with vetted practitioners and provides technology-driven navigation tools that support healing.

Located in Mount Pleasant, Tikvahh’s new office space in the Harbor Entrepreneur Center will allow the company to build out its technology platform and innovation initiatives.

“Tikvah Health and Wellness’ new operation underscores the cutting-edge business environment we have cultivated in Charleston County and throughout South Carolina,” commented Lightsey. “We are proud to welcome Tikvah to the Lowcountry and congratulate the company on this announcement.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/adobestock_1473976974.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 15:10:00.050942

Taking public comments We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel.","We are embarking on a new statewide study to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts surrounding the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel—including measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

Taking public comments

We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel. In October, we will hold two virtual meetings where interested parties can make public comments:

Tuesday, Oct. 21 virtual meeting starting at 1 p.m.

Register on Zoom

Wednesday, Oct. 22 virtual meeting starting at 9 a.m.

Register on Zoom

All the comments we receive will be valued equally. They help us determine our approach to the programmatic impact statement, or study. Comments addressing specific pathways, impacts or issues are the most useful. We have prepared a fact sheet about providing effective public comments.

We are also taking written public comments until Wednesday, Nov. 5, at 11:59 p.m. Interested parties can submit comments using our online public comment form or send them by mail to:

What's driving the numbers?",David Brown,,,,,https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/texas-energy-consumption-drivers-population-ai-data-centers/,"This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity: Texas Standard: So the Department of Energy says Texas used twice as much energy as California and three times as much as Florida in 2023.
And so that accounts for about a half of Texas energy demand, where in California and Florida, it’s a much smaller sliver.
Going forward, ERCOT, who operates the state’s power grid, they’re predicting energy demand in Texas could double by 2030.
And the largest percentage of that projected energy demand growth comes from data centers.
It’s not just hinging on these data centers, it’s going to be coming regardless, given the variety of demand pulls going on here.","Over the past 10 years or so, one of the most durable narratives in the current chapter of the Texas story is the explosive population growth we’ve been tracking – a level of growth that’s put added strain on Texas’s infrastructure, that’s to be sure.

That’s especially true for our electric grid, which was set up to operate mostly separate from the national grid. That’s created some issues to be sure, particularly during weather conditions causing demand to outstrip supply.

But there’s another issue related to Texas’ economic growth that promises to put much further strain on the state’s electrical resources.

Matt Smith, head energy analyst at Kpler, joined the Standard for a closer look. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So the Department of Energy says Texas used twice as much energy as California and three times as much as Florida in 2023. That’s astonishing. What seems to be driving this outperformance?

Matt Smith: The first thing is the reason they’re focusing on these three states is because they are the three largest energy-consuming states in the U.S. It’s also important to bear in mind that this is total energy, so it includes transportation as well as electricity generation.

But as you were mentioning, the explosion in the population in Texas has happened over the last few years, but it’s actually outperformance from the industrial demand side of things that is driving demand higher. And so that accounts for about a half of Texas energy demand, where in California and Florida, it’s a much smaller sliver. They’re much more focused on commercial and residential demand, as well as transportation.

Now, just to bear in mind, when we talk about industrial demand, that’s Texas’s energy-intensive chemical manufacturing, oil and natural gas extraction, production, petroleum refining, agricultural industry. So it’s all of the behemoth of industry, right?

Well, yeah, but I thought that you were going to be pointing to something else and that’s the explosive growth that Texas has seen in artificial intelligence and these data centers which have sprouted up all over the state. In fact, it seems like the state is going out of its way to position itself as the capital for AI, or at least the backbone that supports that AI infrastructure, these huge data centers.

Yeah, and so there’s a number of areas across the U.S. that can do this. Texas, Louisiana, Virginia, etc, are kind of obvious ones to locate these data centers, just because of the natural resources available, right? So you have the Permian Basin, etc. So you have access to natural gas, to other resources. And so that’s part of it.

If we kind of take a step back, though, industrial demand in the past [has] been from these traditional sources, right. Going forward, ERCOT, who operates the state’s power grid, they’re predicting energy demand in Texas could double by 2030. And the largest percentage of that projected energy demand growth comes from data centers.

And so, yes, it’s going to be a current and future story as opposed to have been something in the past.

Well, what about the power generation mix for Texas? Is anything changing on that front?

And you know, as you look at these three states, are there any comparisons? Somebody doing it better than than we are right now? And of course, there’s been a lot of focus on the fact that we are not fully integrated with the national grid.

Well, renewables is a big piece for California, right? They’re very environmentally friendly, they’ve been focused on solar so much. It’s the largest generator of solar power in the U.S. But then it’s followed by Texas and Florida, actually, in second and third place.

And then when you talk about wind power, Texas is a leading source for that – accounts for up to a third of total U.S. wind power generation.

But it’s just a story of of size, right? So when we talk about Texas, they consume more coal, natural gas and petroleum than any other state, right, but is also second only to California in terms of renewable energy consumption.

So yes, the mix is changing, but Texas is consuming all of these things – like half of the power generation is met by natural gas right now, about 22% by winds, and 8% by solar, 30% from wind and solar, 12% coal, 7% nuclear.

But Matt, if you step back further – and you were talking earlier about how we’re looking at double the demand by 2030, I think you you were saying… What are the long-term fixes?

It’s got to be everything, right? It’s gotta be a combination of those factors.

The challenge still remains with solar and wind is that it’s not baseload for power generation. So there is much more emphasis going forward here on the solar side of things, but it’s emphasis across these various different commodities I’ve mentioned to meet this need.

One thing to bear in mind, too, is that this demand growth is not just coming from data centers, but is coming from an ongoing increasing population in Texas. Cryptocurrency mining, hotter weather… There’s a number of factors, right?

It’s not just hinging on these data centers, it’s going to be coming regardless, given the variety of demand pulls going on here.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ercot-media-tour_41235273065_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 13:05:08.180171

By 2030, AI data centers could consume nearly 10% of all the electricity produced in the United States.

That’s more power than every home in California and New York combined.

And we’re feeling the strain already.

In Virginia — the epicenter of America’s data center industry — utilities are warning of multi-year delays to connect new projects. And in Georgia and Texas, regulators are scrambling to approve new natural gas plants just to keep up with the demand.

Even Wall Street is on high alert about this issue. Goldman Sachs estimates that power demand from U.S. data centers will more than double by 2030, driven almost entirely by AI.

Yet our power grid is already stretched to its limits.

And if the grid can’t keep up, then how will America power the next generation of AI?

We’ve talked about how nuclear energy might become the ultimate power source for AI…

And how fusion could provide unlimited energy in the future.

But what if I told you that the Earth’s crust holds a surprising energy source that could supply humanity’s energy needs for the next 170,000 years?

Enter Hydrogen

Clean energy proponents usually focus on solar panels or wind turbines.

But without steady backup, they can leave entire regions vulnerable when demand surges or the weather turns.

These energy sources also take up a lot of land, and communities often push back because they don’t want turbines or solar fields hurting their views or property values.

That’s why a different clean technology has started moving into the spotlight…

Hydrogen fuel cells.

Instead of burning fuel, a hydrogen cell splits molecules to generate electricity.

The only byproduct they create is water, and that can be reused for cooling in data centers.

To be clear, this isn’t a new technology. Hydrogen fuel cells have been a niche source of energy for decades now.

They’ve been used as backup power for telecom towers and in experimental buses in California. They’ve even been used in forklifts in Amazon’s warehouses.

But now, they’re being scaled to power some of the most energy-hungry machines on Earth.

The best example sits just outside Houston, where a startup called ECL has built what it calls the world’s first off-grid, hydrogen-powered AI campus.

This pilot facility runs one megawatt of fuel cell capacity. That’s enough to drive racks of NVIDIA’s latest GB300 and NVL72 systems, which are some of the most advanced AI chips on the market.

But ECL isn’t stopping there.

Its next phase calls for one gigawatt of capacity. That’s a thousand-fold jump.

For perspective, that’s the size of a full-scale nuclear plant. Except this facility will be modular, scalable and emission-free.

What makes ECL’s design unique is its efficiency. The data center runs at a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of just 1.1, compared to a typical facility’s 1.5 or higher.

And wastewater from the cells is captured and recycled to cool the data center. That means there’s no need for external water. And that’s going to be critical as droughts continue to hit the American West.

It also shows why hydrogen has recently started getting federal backing.

In late 2023, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced $7 billion in federal funding to launch seven regional clean hydrogen hubs to accelerate hydrogen production, storage and distribution.

These hubs were planned to span regions including the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Appalachia, and were chosen to anchor new hydrogen infrastructure across strategic corridors.

The DOE anticipated that, with the help of private companies, the total investment could rise to nearly $50 billion.

But that hit a snag last week when the DOE announced it would cancel over $7.5 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects.

Among those planned cancellations was funding for proposed hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest.

But if we can get past partisan politics and focus on what’s best for our country’s energy needs, new hydrogen hubs could be a huge boon for both AI and our environment.

Here’s My Take

Until now, hydrogen’s biggest problem has been finding a customer big enough to justify scaling up.

If AI data centers become that customer, the rollout of hydrogen as an energy source could accelerate much faster than expected.

But hydrogen isn’t a silver bullet that will instantly solve our energy needs. And there are still some major issues that need to be solved.

Most hydrogen today is made from natural gas, not renewable electricity. Transporting and storing it at scale is expensive. And hydrogen fuel cells must prove they can run for years without downtime. That’s a non-negotiable requirement for hyperscale computing.

But AI is forcing the U.S. to rethink how it generates and delivers power. And hydrogen is one of the few technologies that can deliver large amounts of electricity, on-site, without waiting decades for new transmission lines.

A recent report indicates that Earth’s crust could hold naturally occurring hydrogen reserves large enough to supply humanity’s energy needs for 170,000 years.

That would mean a cheaper, faster path to off-grid hydrogen data centers…

And a new energy race over who taps those underground reserves first.

But even though this report is promising, most experts see it as a long-shot scenario that’s still years from proving viable at scale.

I’m bullish on hydrogen as the “fuel of the future.”

And with AI demand surging past what the grid can supply, that future might be closer than we think.

The company posted a series of cryptic social media clips over the weekend that drew attention from investors and enthusiasts alike.

One video featured a black, hubcap-like object with the Tesla logo spinning before the numbers “10/7” appeared — likely pointing to an October 7 announcement.

Another showed a car shrouded in darkness, with only its headlights visible.

Tesla shares were up 3% in early trading at ₹443.26, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.

Speculation grows around Tesla’s next model

Tesla’s last major product launch came nearly two years ago with the Cybertruck, a highly anticipated pickup that has since underperformed expectations.

Executives have indicated that a lower-cost version of the Model Y is in development to help sustain sales following the expiration of US electric vehicle tax credits.

Another long-awaited model is the second-generation Roadster, a project first showcased in 2017.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in February 2024 that Tesla was aiming to ship the vehicle this year, but no official timeline has since been confirmed.

The company could benefit from a new model introduction.

Through September, Tesla sold about 1.22 million cars in 2025, down 6% from the same period a year earlier, despite record third-quarter deliveries of nearly 500,000 vehicles.

Analysts on Tesla stock

Tesla stock fell 2.4% last week, even after reporting stronger-than-expected delivery numbers on Thursday.

The muted reaction followed a roughly 40% rally in the month leading up to the report, suggesting the strong results were already priced in.

JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman raised his price target on Tesla shares from ₹115 to ₹150 but maintained an Underweight rating.

He noted that third-quarter deliveries of 497,000 vehicles exceeded forecasts by around 12% but described the strength as a “temporary pull-forward” ahead of the expiration of US EV credits.

JP Morgan expects Tesla to post earnings per share of ₹0.59 for the quarter, about 18% lower than a year earlier.

Analysts are now focused on how Tesla’s demand will hold up without federal incentives.

Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan warned that fourth-quarter deliveries could weaken as Tesla tapers discounts and promotional offers.

He forecast added margin pressure and lower regulatory credit sales, placing his 2025 earnings estimate 29% below Wall Street’s consensus.

Goldman Sachs analysts also flagged the loss of tax credits as a near-term challenge but said the company could find support from seasonal demand trends, new model launches, and upcoming events such as its shareholder meeting on November 6.

At present, investor attention is centred on Tesla’s mysterious October 7 announcement, which could determine whether the company can reignite growth momentum after a subdued year for electric-vehicle sales.

EV market faces sharp decline as tax credits expire

The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on October 1, 2025, has sent shockwaves through the electric vehicle market, with immediate implications for battery demand. Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that EV market share will plummet by more than half to between 4% and 5% of total sales by year's end, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal.

""We expect a pretty deep fall off,"" Farley stated, while Nissan Americas Chairman Christian Meunier warned that ""October should be the worst market in years for EVs.""

The credit's final month saw a surge in EV sales, with electric models representing an estimated 12.2% of retail sales in September—a record share that now appears unsustainable. Dealers currently hold approximately 134,000 unsold EVs, representing a two-month supply at current sales rates, according to Cox Automotive data cited in the WSJ report.

Consumer sentiment reflects this market uncertainty. A Harris Poll survey found that nearly a third of consumers who were likely to buy an electric vehicle would either be much less likely to consider an EV or won't consider one at all without the federal tax credit. While 54% of these ""EV defectors"" said they'll return to gasoline vehicles, 30% indicated they'd choose hybrids instead—a shift that still impacts battery demand but at reduced scale.

$7.6 billion in clean energy projects axed

The administration's broader assault on clean energy infrastructure became evident with the Energy Department's October 2 announcement canceling $7.56 billion in funding for 223 clean energy projects. The cuts, reported by the Washington Post, disproportionately affect Democratic-led states and include numerous battery storage initiatives.

Among the canceled projects was a $30 million award for battery storage at a California children's hospital and at least $15 million for battery storage and grid upgrades serving Indigenous communities in New Mexico. The cuts also eliminated funding for a project that would have added 28 gigawatts of new energy generation to Minnesota's power grid, mostly from wind and solar—capacity that would have required substantial battery storage integration.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the cancellations, claiming in a statement that the projects ""did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Notably, 26% of the terminated awards—valued at over $3.1 billion—were issued between Election Day and Inauguration Day, suggesting the previous administration's rush to secure funding before the transition.

Strategic investment in the domestic lithium supply chain

Paradoxically, while dismantling renewable energy projects, the Trump administration is simultaneously investing in the battery supply chain's foundation. The Energy Department announced it will take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and its Nevada Thacker Pass mining project, restructuring a $2.26 billion loan agreement from 2024.

""It's in America's best interest to get that mine built,"" Wright told Bloomberg Television, emphasizing that Thacker Pass production could help reduce China's dominance in the lithium market.

The Thacker Pass project, among the largest known lithium deposits in the US, is expected to produce 88 million pounds annually of lithium carbonate for lithium-ion batteries. This investment aligns with broader Trump administration efforts to secure domestic control of critical materials, including similar equity stakes in rare-earths miner MP Materials and strategic positions in the steel and semiconductor sectors.

Industry adaptation and market reality

Automakers are scrambling to adapt to the new landscape. General Motors and Ford have committed to extending EV incentives temporarily, with GM working on dealer programs to effectively continue the $7,500 credit for leases. Hyundai is offering $7,500 discounts on remaining 2025 model EVs and cutting 2026 Ioniq 5 prices by up to $9,800.

However, these manufacturer-funded incentives represent significant financial strain. Ford expects to lose approximately $5 billion in its EV business this year, and CEO Farley acknowledged that promotional programs ""are not going to last forever.""

The fundamental challenge remains cost competitiveness. The average EV sold for upward of $57,000 in August—over $9,000 more than comparable gas-powered vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data from the WSJ report. This price gap, previously bridged by federal incentives, now represents a substantial market barrier.

Battery industry implications

For the battery industry, these developments create a complex operating environment. The elimination of EV incentives and renewable energy projects reduces near-term demand for battery storage systems across transportation and grid applications. The Harris Poll data suggesting that a majority of EV defectors would reconsider with incentives of at least $5,000 indicates that battery demand remains price-sensitive and policy-dependent.

Yet the lithium mining investment signals recognition that battery technology remains strategically important for national competitiveness. The administration's focus on supply chain security over demand stimulation suggests a belief that market forces will eventually drive adoption while ensuring domestic control of critical materials.

This ""one step forward, two steps back"" approach leaves battery manufacturers navigating reduced immediate demand while potentially benefiting from more secure, domestically-sourced raw materials in the long term. The challenge will be surviving the transition period as the market adjusts to new economic realities without federal support for deployment while building toward eventual cost parity and renewed growth.

The administration's contradictory signals reflect the complex politics of energy transition, acknowledging the strategic importance of battery technology while ideologically opposing the policies that would accelerate its adoption. For an industry built on the promise of clean energy transformation, the path forward requires adapting to a landscape where government support flows toward supply chains rather than market development.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltbb8dbb8002daade2/68e3e31d2c719e8cf9599ce6/DOE-Sec-Wright-2223538060.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-06 13:03:54.268634

Four factors ultimately drove Talon’s pivot to TOPCon technology.
First, the realisation that TOPCon cells could serve as effective back cells for future perovskite tandems, maintaining the company’s long-term technology roadmap.
Second, existing US infrastructure was better suited to integrate TOPCon cells into p-type production lines compared to HJT.
Fraunhofer partnership and R&D strategy A key pillar of Talon’s technology development is its partnership with Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE.","“As we went down the road of TOPCon, of course this lawfare that’s happening with intellectual property in the TOPCon space was prevalent,” Tesanovich explains. “So we took a deep dive to look at what IP we could be infringing on. After that analysis, because we’re utilising PVD in our process versus PECVD or other CVD processes, the only IP that we really infringed on was the TetraSun IP from First Solar.”

The TOPCon patent challenge

TOPCon technology has been considered too risky for US manufacturers due to extensive patent litigation between major Asian producers. The technology has been at the centre of what Tesanovich calls “lawfare” – with companies like Maxeon, LG, and Trina locked in patent disputes. Last month, in an interview with PV Tech, the CEO of another US cell production start-up, ES Foundry, expressed his belief that no company can safely produce TOPCon cells in the US without fear of litigation.

But Tesanovich is confident in Talon’s position. By using physical vapour deposition (PVD) rather than chemical vapour deposition (CVD) processes, the company believes it sidesteps most patent issues. The crucial breakthrough came through securing a licensing agreement with First Solar for the TetraSun intellectual property.

“We reached out to First Solar. We’re very aligned on our idea of what the domestic marketplace should look like,” Tesanovich says. “Because of that and also utilising TOPCon cells as back cells and their drive towards perovskites in tandem to supplement their thin film, we really found a great strategic partner in the industry, almost a big brother.”

This partnership makes Talon “the only licence holder in the US that has the ability to produce TOPCon cells that are free and clear of IP”, according to Tesanovich. The company has also engaged directly with other TOPCon IP stakeholders, conducting detailed discussions about potential infringement. “Those conversations have been very positive, and, at this point, we feel that we’re free and clear,” he adds.

From HJT to TOPCon

Talon’s journey began in an unlikely place: the oil and gas industry. Tesanovich and his partners Brandon Dewan and Jared Light built Eagle Group from a small business in 2013 into a major supplier of metallurgical products for hydrocarbon transmission and drilling, serving clients including BP, Repsol, Shell and Chevron.

“A lot of our clients were companies that were getting into renewables, and specifically we saw solar as a great opportunity,” Tesanovich recalls. The team recognised that while the US had lost much of its solar manufacturing intellectual property and footprint to Asia over the past 15 years, there was now “an immediate need for manufacturing here in the US”.

Initially, the company planned to manufacture heterojunction (HJT) cells, attracted by their compatibility with future perovskite tandem technologies. However, market feedback from potential customers proved sobering.

“As we went to market with HJT plans, the initial reception was positive, but as we started drilling down into it and the 45X [tax credit] was kicking in, a lot of the module companies were very hesitant to want to try a new technology,” Tesanovich explains. Module manufacturers would need to adjust stringers and temperatures for HJT cells, creating operational complications they preferred to avoid while benefiting from existing tax incentives.

Four factors ultimately drove Talon’s pivot to TOPCon technology. First, the realisation that TOPCon cells could serve as effective back cells for future perovskite tandems, maintaining the company’s long-term technology roadmap. Second, existing US infrastructure was better suited to integrate TOPCon cells into p-type production lines compared to HJT. Third, HJT technology remained “somewhat unproven in the field”, says Tesanovich. Finally, even Asian manufacturers were “running into difficulties producing HJT cells at a reasonable cost”, Tesanovich says.

The shift also aligned with market constraints in the US caused by ongoing patent litigation. “Having a TOPCon cell is more than good for the US marketplace,” Tesanovich notes.

European equipment, American manufacturing

Talon has made a bold bet on European equipment suppliers, challenging industry conventional wisdom. At Intersolar in Munich two years ago, Tesanovich recalls sitting on a panel where “everybody was saying it’s impossible to utilise European equipment and create a business case that supports the higher capex cost”.

“We took that as a challenge,” he says. The company’s analysis showed that while European equipment requires higher capital expenditure, operational expenses are significantly lower due to reduced power usage, water consumption, downtime and staffing requirements. “You hit parity within two to three years on the higher capex because it saves on opex.”

The European equipment strategy also provides strategic advantages, including local spare parts availability and reduced dependence on Southeast Asian supply chains. Crucially, Talon has “zero FEOC IP” and “zero FEOC investment” in its project, insulating it from Foreign Entity of Concern regulations that have complicated other US solar projects, Tesanovich claims.

Fraunhofer partnership and R&D strategy

A key pillar of Talon’s technology development is its partnership with Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE. Rather than building an R&D facility in Houston, the company decided to invest in a pilot line at Fraunhofer’s Freiburg facility.

“We were going to do our R&D and pilot line here in the US at our facility,” Tesanovich explains. “What we realised is that was going to be a very myopic focus on our current equipment versus a wider vision around what are the next technologies, what are the new advancements that are coming in. Fraunhofer is probably best in class in the world on that. And so we decided that we would put invest in a pilot line with Fraunhofer and our equipment suppliers in Freiburg, Germany.”

The pilot line, coming online in Q2 2026, will produce G12, M10, and larger format cells using identical equipment to Talon’s main production lines. This approach allows the company to dial in formulas and processes before its Houston facility reaches full production, enabling rapid ramp-up while providing training opportunities for US-based teams. Another benefit is that Talon will be able to send its team over to Fraunhofer to train on the same equipment that will be used in the eventual production line.

Importantly, the equipment already has the capability to deposit perovskite tandem layers, a factor that Tesanovich says positions Talon well to have a headstart in this emerging area of PV technology. “What we’re doing is coming together to create a handshake from scalable commercial industrial manufacturing already having that capability in our tools,” he says. “This is a strategy that we’ve deployed to get tandem and perovskite cells out into the marketplace sooner than later.

Policy tailwinds and market demand

Despite the policy uncertainties for the US solar industry following the recent enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Tesanovich sees the regulatory environment as providing “quite a bit of tailwind” for Talon’s project. The combination of manufacturing tax credits (45X) and deployment incentives creates what he calls “carrots and sticks” that benefit domestic manufacturers.

“The majority of developers have already safe harboured their projects for the next four to five years,” he notes, referring to projects that locked in favourable tax treatment before recent policy changes. This provides demand visibility even as some incentive programmes face uncertainty.

The company has also benefited from strong support from AI and data centre companies that have been “very vocal in their support of solar and battery” for powering their facilities. Solar and battery storage represent “the only deployable power source that is short-term,” compared to natural gas projects requiring at least two to three years and nuclear projects taking 10-15 years.

“The only way to win the AI race is via solar and battery, and that has become clear to this administration,” Tesanovich observes.

Supply chain and customer base

Talon has secured partnerships with domestic suppliers including Hemlock and Corning for polysilicon and wafers, as well as Nowegian ingot and wafter producer NorSun as that company develops its capabilities. This domestic supply chain approach aligns with growing demand from independent power producers (IPPs) and developers seeking “non-FEOC supply chain” options.

The company’s facility is “essentially completely booked for the next three to five years, depending on the contract”, with strong demand from IPPs and developers. Tesanovich notes that Talon provides value to various industry participants, including potential competitors, by offering cells that won’t trigger patent litigation for module manufacturers.

Talon expects to begin commercial production in Q1 2027, with its Houston facility already secured, along with necessary permits, power, water and wastewater infrastructure. The company has invested heavily in workforce development, establishing programmes at local high schools and trade schools while partnering with Rice University for advanced technical training.

“We’ve spent a lot of time on the front side of our workforce development,” Tesanovich emphasises, noting strong local enthusiasm for these educational initiatives.

Technology reliability and future outlook

Addressing concerns about TOPCon’s field reliability, Tesanovich points to recent research that has resolved early degradation issues. “By utilising good quality inputs as well as playing with formulas to remove aluminium, the industry has found their way around that,” he explains. “Fraunhofer and others have done extensive research on the degradation in TOPCon, and there is a very clear pathway to not having those issues in the marketplace.”

As Talon prepares to begin production, the company represents a test case for whether US manufacturers can successfully compete in solar cell production using advanced technologies and European equipment partnerships. The industry will no doubt be watching keenly to see if Talon’s strategy of producing TOPCon cells in the US without being dragged into patent battles pays off.

Its success or failure will likely influence whether other US entrepreneurs follow Talon’s path or continue to view domestic solar cell manufacturing as more trouble than it’s worth.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talon-PV.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 15:07:42.210789

BMW and Stellantis (parent company of Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and other brands) will offer $7,500 discounts on electric vehicles (EVs) now that the federal government no longer does.

The two join General Motors and Ford in finding creative ways to extend a discount to match the faded federal incentive.

The federal government offered a tax incentive of up to $7,500 off the purchase or lease of many new EVs as part of a program meant to encourage automakers to shift factories and supply chains to the U.S. The federal incentive ended when October began, torpedoed by a new law pushed by President Trump.

Automakers sold record numbers of EVs in the third quarter as the deadline approached. But analysts from Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive expect fourth-quarter EV sales to plummet as the discount fades. EV sales will likely find a new level and begin growing slowly sometime next year.

So, some automakers are trying to keep it going — at least until dealers can sell down some of the inventory they currently hold.

BMW’s website shows a $7,500 discount on all of its current EVs, with a note that buyers “must take delivery by October 31st, 2025.”

It’s been a tough year for recyclers in the U.S., most of whom are facing various levels of uncertainty related to the interconnected effects of tariffs, labor constraints and consumer confidence.

Though global and domestic economic pressures are expected to continue into next year, there’s reason to be optimistic about longer-term economic trends that could spur future demand for recycled content, said Emily Sanchez, chief economist at the Recycled Materials Association, at the National Recycling Congress at Wichita State University in Nebraska.

“The industry has always thrived on being innovative. They’ve always thrived on being adaptive. Recycling is fundamentally about solving the eternal problem of scarcity, turning waste into resources,” she said.

Sanchez outlined recent economic headwinds and trends during a presentation on Oct. 3.

Tariffs have already reshaped commodity markets and created destabilizing economic conditions for recyclers in the U.S., particularly those who have more of a dependency on exports and those whose businesses are closer to hard-hit industries, she said. “These policy shifts have been making planning really impossible, but recyclers have been just adapting as best as they can,” Sanchez said.

Overarching U.S. labor market trends are also affecting recyclers. There’s a “downshift in growth and job growth that’s underway,” she said, driven in part by higher cost pressures from tariffs, inflation worries and other factors.

During Q2 earnings calls this summer, several major publicly traded waste companies reported a range of these headwinds were affecting their guidance this year. Most reported lower commodity prices were weighing on earnings, combined with higher labor costs and manufacturing softness. But Republic Services CFO Brian DelGhiaccio predicted the macro environment for manufacturing could turn around in coming years.

Immigration policy is also contributing to labor market weakness, Sanchez said. “Changes in immigration policy have reduced the labor pool and in a really big way in certain sectors. And then on the demand side, the demand for jobs has been really soft.”

Meanwhile, consumer spending is expected to slow down as the year goes on, in part because of these job trends, she said. That lower consumer demand means companies aren’t churning out as many new products, including those made with recycled materials.

The Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and indicated that it could again lower rates later in October.

“I’m particularly looking at how that’s going to affect demand in certain markets that impact recycled materials, like in cars, auto parts, houses and [capital expenditures],” Sanchez said. “These capital expenditures might require recycled inputs, or [generate] recyclable materials at some point in the future.”

Sanchez said companies that have delayed major investments this year have had a direct impact on the industry, but such caution may lead to pent-up demand for recycled materials as early as next year. “There were a lot of companies that have just been postponing purchases today, and they’re going to need materials tomorrow,” she said.

Meanwhile, U.S. recyclers are also weathering global economic impacts, such as a slowdown of global growth that likely means less demand for recycled materials, Sanchez said. She estimates global real GDP growth will be about 3% this year, and decrease slightly to about 2.9% in 2026.

“By this point of the year, we’re seeing that goods trade is weak, and that matters a lot, since so much of goods are made with international supply chains, and then there’s just tremendous uncertainty and a lot of unsettled policy risk,” she said.

But despite geopolitical challenges, she sees a silver lining: “The pace of global growth has actually been pretty resilient” this year, she said.

Under the deal, green electricity from two solar farms will be supplied to French national railway company SNCF Voyageurs in a move to accelerate the shift to cleaner, fossil-free public transport.

Developed and constructed by global renewable energy company BayWa r.e. and acquired through Octopus’ Sky fund, the solar farms Greenberry and Fontenet 3 (pictured), are expected to deliver over 100GWh of green electricity each year.

The two solar farms are located on former military bases in central and south-west France. Over the agreement’s 25-year period, these solar farms will produce 2.5TWh of clean electricity – enough to power 15,500 TGV trips from Paris to Rennes each year. It marks BayWa r.e.’s and Octopus’ first agreement of this kind in France.

The move brings SNCF Voyageurs a step closer to its sustainability goals. Since 2018, SNCF Voyageurs has expanded its corporate PPA programme, aiming to source 20% of its electricity through CPPAs.

It comes as Octopus is expanding its footprint in France, now managing over 500MW of solar and wind projects and supplying energy to more than 600,000 homes through its retail business.

SNCF Energie’s managing director Richard Fécamp said: “This is a huge leap forward for SNCF’s ambition to decarbonise and expand rail transport.

“As one of France’s largest energy consumers, we aim to source between 40% and 50% of the electricity consumed by our trains from renewables by 2030, including 20% from PPAs.

“The Fontenet 3 and Greenberry PPAs represent significant progress in our commitment to clean energy transformation.”

BayWa r.e. chief operations officer Daniel Gaefke said: “Completing the negotiation of these two PPAs in just three months – from kick-off to signature – underscores what a perfect match this collaboration is and our commitment to delivering large-scale renewable solutions at pace.

“We’re proud to support SNCF’s green rail ambitions by providing expert technical management to Octopus’ assets and look forward to working together with our valued partners on many more projects to advance decarbonisation across France and beyond.”

Co-head of Octopus Energy Generation Alex Brierly added: “Travelling by train is already one of the cleanest ways to get around, and we’re proud to help put SNCF’s trains on an even greener track. We’ve already invested in over 30 solar and wind projects across France, and we’ll continue to steam ahead to power the country’s green energy future.”",https://renews.biz/media/35198/fontenet-3-solar-farm-credit-baywa-re.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-10-06 13:04:00.807990

This edition of the Projects Weekly highlights several milestones in the world of solar. To start things off, EDF power solutions North America and El Paso Electric announced the start of commercial operations at the Milagro Energy Center in New Mexico. Avangrid has begun install solar panels for the Tower Solar project in Oregon. TurningPoint Energy and Pivot Energy have launched a new solar project in Maryland. Ameresco and the city of Olympia, Washington, have broken ground on a nearly $17 million building retrofit project at the 86-year-old Olympia Armory. X-ELIO has powered on a solar + storage plant in Texas that will supply BASF Freeport operations. A car dealership in Pomeroy, Ohio, flipped the switch on a new solar energy system to power operations. Bearing manufacturer Schaeffler has added a rooftop solar system at its facility in Connecticut. Finally, after years of planning, New Mexico has launched its long-awaited community solar program. And speaking of projects, don’t forget to vote for the 2025 Project of the Year Awards.

EDF and El Paso Electric begin commercial operations at Milagro Energy Center

EDF power solutions North America and El Paso Electric (EPE) have started operations at the Milagro Solar + Storage project in New Mexico with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by 100 guests. The 150 MWdc solar photovoltaic project combined with a 75 MWac / 4-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) will supply electricity to EPE under a 20-year PPA.

“Launching our first solar and storage project in New Mexico is an exciting milestone, and we look forward to supporting EPE as this project delivers long-term price stability, stimulates economic growth, and reduces emissions,” said Kate O’Hair, senior VP of U,S, development for EDF power solutions.

Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro Solar + Storage project is designed to store electricity during peak hours for solar generation in a series of batteries. This stored energy is then dispatched when needed to help manage capacity demand, creating a balance between electricity generation and demand. Energy storage can manage evening energy ramps, mitigate curtailment and provide grid stability.

Cool factor: The project created approximately 200 jobs during its peak construction phase, with 100 positions filled by New Mexico residents. Over Milagro’s operating lifespan, it is expected to generate around $18 million in tax revenue for Doña Ana County, and its school districts supported under the Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB).

“This achievement involved 300,000 labor hours dedicated to installing 282,000 solar panels, all completed without a single recordable incident,” said Nick Bergren, project manager for Blattner Energy, which constructed the project.

Avangrid begins panel installation on Tower Solar project

Avangrid Inc. has started to install solar panels at its Tower Solar project in Morrow County, Oregon. When completed, Tower Solar will deliver energy to the Portland General Electric (PGE) power grid and help power a new QTS data center campus that will support Meta’s operations in the region.

“Installing these first panels marks a major milestone for this new solar project in Oregon and adds to Avangrid’s growing fleet of energy facilities across the nation,” said Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO. “Tower Solar will bring much needed capacity to the regional electric grid, improving the reliability and availability of electricity.”

Tower Solar is located just west of Boardman, Oregon, and located on about 900 acres of industrially zoned land owned by the Port of Morrow. The project will utilize more than 200,000 solar panels assembled by SEG Solar in its newly built Houston manufacturing facility. Avangrid was SEG Solar’s first utility-scale customer to receive solar modules assembled from its new U.S. facility. The total installed capacity of Tower Solar will be 166 MWdc (120 MWac).

Cool factor: At the peak of construction, Avangrid expects Tower Solar to create more than 200 jobs, the vast majority of which will be sourced from the region. Tower Solar is expected to pay about $20 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes) and property taxes which will support a variety of public services, including education. Tower Solar will deliver energy to PGE’s grid through Green Future Impact (GFI), a voluntary program designed to help large commercial, industrial, and municipal customers meet their ambitious sustainability and carbon reduction goals through the development of new clean energy facilities in our region.

“The Tower Solar project represents a meaningful step in Morrow County’s continued economic diversification,” said David Sykes, Chair of the Morrow County Commission. “By embracing renewable energy, we’re not only creating jobs and strengthening our local economy. We’re investing in a more resilient future for our citizens.”

Powering up Maryland with 16.6 MW solar portfolio near Baltimore

Maryland’s Baltimore region has a new 2.9 MWdc solar farm. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held at the Clarksville (Howard County), Maryland solar site on Sept. 25 to celebrate the energization of the new community solar farm. Distinguished guests, as well as employees from TurningPoint Energy (TPE) and Pivot Energy, joined community members to mark the completion of the solar project.

“In addition to renewable energy benefits, this solar farm will support dual-use solar, sheep grazing, native pollinator planting, and other efforts to ensure the long-term productivity of this land,” said Samantha Frick, director of community relations and impact at Pivot.

The solar farm was developed by TPE, a leading greenfield developer in Maryland, and is owned and operated by Pivot, a national renewable energy provider and independent power producer. This solar farm is the first to go online in a six-project,16.6 MWdc, portfolio developed by TPE, and built, operated, and owned by Pivot.

Cool factor: With construction completed this summer, this project represents a significant addition to the state’s solar generating capacity and will play a role in helping Maryland achieve its 50% renewable electricity goal by 2030. It will generate approximately 4.25 million kWh of affordable renewable energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of up to 370 Maryland homes. The solar array is made up of nearly 5,500 solar modules, enough to fill nearly 10 football fields.

This project is part of Maryland’s innovative Community Solar Energy Generating System (CSEGS) Pilot Program, which expands access to affordable energy. Community solar enables Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) customers to gain access to lower-cost, renewable energy generated locally. Subscribers to this community solar farm will save an average of 10% off their electricity bill each year. Reflecting strong community engagement, the project is now fully subscribed, with 11 unique participants, including a local church, demonstrating local interest in shared renewable energy solutions.

Ameresco breaks ground on building retrofit in Olympia, Washington

Ameresco Inc. broke ground on a building retrofit project that will add a 150 kW solar system at the Olympia Armory, in Olympia, Washington. The approximately $17 million multi-phase adaptive reuse project will start with upgrades to the 86-year-old building that address safety requirements, improve accessibility, and enhance energy efficiency. Improvements to the building and the installation of a solar PV system will proceed in parallel. The solar technology will facilitate on-site energy generation and support ongoing cost reductions.

In total, the project is anticipated to take approximately 18 months to complete. The multiphase infrastructure improvement initiative is being delivered through an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) with Ameresco, who provided price and performance guarantees and helped ensure participation from local businesses and key community stakeholders.

Cool factor: The Olympia Armory was first constructed in 1939, on the same site that was previously home to the city’s primary public school, built in 1890. The Armory served as the headquarters for various army units from World War II onward and hosted a range of events from art exhibitions to car shows. It was acquired by the city of Olympia in 2022, and the city contracted with Ameresco to support plans to repurpose the building as a creative campus and arts center for the community.

“We are excited to bring this next iteration of the Olympia Armory to life, building on the site’s history as a community gathering place,” said Valerie Roberts, Armory building manager. “Ameresco is the perfect partner to help execute our vision. Their expertise and innovative approach provide that the Armory is operating efficiently and equipped with the energy resiliency technology to serve our community in its new form.”

X-ELIO powers on Texas solar + storage plant to supply BASF operations

X-ELIO has launched operations at its Liberty Energy Project in Dayton, Texas. The project combines 72 MW of solar PV capacity with an additional 60 MW of battery storage, marking X-ELIO’s first combined solar PV and BESS project in the United States. With Liberty now operational, 100% of the expected imported power at BASF‘s Freeport site will be supplied by renewable energy.

“The inauguration of the Liberty Project marks an important milestone in our journey toward more sustainable operations and enabling the green transformation of our customers,” said Brad Morrison, senior VP and GM at BASF Freeport. “Thanks to our partnership with X-ELIO, we are able to supply 100% of our expected purchased power at our Freeport site from renewable sources. This project supports our long-term commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and reflects the kind of collaboration needed to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.”

Cool factor: BASF will source 48 MW of electricity from the Liberty Project to help power its Freeport site as part of a 12-year power purchase agreement (PPA) announced in 2022. Freeport is one of BASF’s six global Verbund sites, which takes an integrated approach to manufacturing, raw materials and energy management.

“The Liberty Project represents a major step in our planned expansion in the U.S., a key market for X-ELIO,” said Lluís Noguera, chairman and CEO at X-ELIO. “We are currently developing a pipeline of 2.8 GW of solar PV and 2.1 GW of storage projects to advance competitive energy solutions, support local communities, and power a growing American economy.”

Under the umbrella of its Community & Nature Plan Program, X-ELIO coordinated with local partners on several initiatives to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods. These include the creation of the Dwelling Garden in Liberty, a shared green space for the community to gather; the construction of a boardwalk at Kleb Woods Nature Preserve, improving accessibility for people with reduced mobility, families with children, and all community members; and the restoration of the drainage system at the Liberty Food Bank, enhancing safety and enabling the organization to better serve families in need.

Pomeroy, Ohio car dealership adds 196.7 kW solar array

Mark Porter Auto Group in Pomeroy, Ohio, hosted a “flip-switching” event to celebrate the completion of a new solar energy system at its Pomeroy location. The 196.7 kW solar array, designed and built by Kokosing Solar, will generate more than 70% of the dealership’s annual electricity needs.

“This solar array is a great example of how, in the face of increasing electricity costs, local businesses can benefit from proven, cost-saving technology,” said Roberta Washburn of Kokosing Solar.

Cool factor: The system is expected to produce over 236,000 kWh of electricity each year, covering the majority of the dealership’s power demand and significantly reducing utility costs. By lowering reliance on the electric grid, the system also provides long-term stability against unpredictable energy prices.

Funding for the project came from a combination of federal tax incentives and a USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grant. These tools helped reduce upfront costs, making it possible for a small business in rural Ohio to invest in advanced energy technology.

Schaeffler adds rooftop solar to roller bearing plant in Connecticut

Schaeffler, the Motion Technology Company, announces the successful implementation of its first fully owned rooftop solar energy system in the Americas region at its plant in Danbury, Connecticut, marking a major step forward in renewable electricity generation.

Schaeffler’s Danbury facility specializes in the production of high-precision roller bearings, ball bearings and related components that are critical for various aerospace applications. Installed directly on the facility’s rooftop, the solar system began producing electricity in June.

Cool factor: The 1,154 MWp solar system, installed in partnership with Solect Energy, is now fully operational and is expected to supply approximately 13% of the plant’s annual electricity needs.

“This is a major step forward in our journey toward energy efficiency and on our decarbonization pathway,” said Wendell Fenner, plant manager, Danbury. “We are proud that Danbury is leading the way for the Americas region, setting an example of how clean energy can be integrated into our operations to benefit both the environment and our business.”

New Mexico launches first community solar project

After years of planning, the long-awaited launch of New Mexico’s first-ever community solar project is ready to power up. The Cuidando Los Niños Community Solar Project hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Sept. 30, in Belen, New Mexico.

“This project proves that community solar works,” said Cory Felder, Mountain West regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA). “It delivers affordable power, local investment, and community benefits in a way no other clean energy program can. New Mexico has been working toward this moment for years, and today we’re proud to see the vision becoming reality.”

New Mexico passed its community solar law, SB84, in 2021, but the rollout has been delayed by regulatory proceedings and utility processes. The ribbon-cutting shows that the program is finally moving forward, unlocking a pipeline of projects that will deliver savings and resilience to households statewide.

Cool factor: The project, developed by Affordable Solar, demonstrates the power of community solar to lower bills, expand energy choice, and deliver local benefits. Affordable Solar was awarded seven community solar projects across New Mexico, totaling 35 MW — which cumulatively will offset the energy usage of 15,000 homes. In addition to providing clean electricity to subscribers, the project is supporting Cuidando Los Niños’ mission to break the cycle of childhood homelessness. As part of the celebration, Affordable Solar will present a $45,000 donation to the nonprofit.

“We are honored to bring the state’s first community solar project to life right here in Belen,” said Dylan Connelly, Project Developer at Affordable Solar. “Community solar is about more than clean energy—it’s about putting people first. By helping families save on their bills and supporting Cuidando Los Niños with this donation, we’re demonstrating the wide-ranging impact this program can have across New Mexico.”

The Cuidando Los Niños project is fully subscribed, thanks in part to the efforts of community solar subscription provider Solstice, ensuring that New Mexicans, especially those who otherwise could not install solar, can benefit from renewable energy. Importantly, 50% of the project’s energy production is reserved to support qualified low-income households, directly lowering electricity bills for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Dive Brief:

California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week vetoed several pieces of energy legislation, including AB 740, which passed with bipartisan support and would have required the state to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan.

In a letter to the governor last month, more than a dozen trade and environmental advocacy groups urged Newsom to sign AB 740 into law, claiming VPPs could save Californians $750 million per year in system costs and provide more than 7,500 MW of capacity.

Newsom said in a statement that he supported the aim of harnessing distributed energy resources, but that the bill would have resulted in costs to the California Energy Commission’s primary operating fund, “which is currently facing an ongoing structural deficit.”

Dive Insight:

Newsom last month signed into law a broad package of energy legislation that laid the groundwork for a regional Western electricity market, extended the state’s cap and trade program and added $18 billion to the state’s wildfire fund.

But he rejected several bills that passed, and other initiatives that had been favored by clean energy advocates were left on the cutting room floor of negotiations.

Edson Perez, California lead at Advanced Energy United, said the governor’s vetoes “mark a major setback for California's supposed commitment to leveraging readily-available solutions to tackle real affordability problems.”

“Together, these decisions establish Governor Newsom as the state leader who walked away from billions in potential savings for ratepayers at a critical moment in California’s history,” Perez said in a statement.

In addition to AB 740, Newsom also vetoed SB 541, AB 1408 and AB 44.

SB 541 would have required the CEC and the California Public Utilities Commission to analyze load-shifting strategies and publish reports on load-shifting for each electric retail supplier. Newsom said in a statement that the bill was “redundant” of existing efforts and cost prohibitive for the state.

AB 1408 would have required the California Independent System Operator and utilities to integrate surplus interconnection into their planning. In a statement, Newsom said the bill “risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing customer electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability.”

Newsom also vetoed AB 44, which would have codified load flexibility in state grid planning.

Despite the American tax incentive being available, electric car sales growth had already slowed over the previous two years, prior to this summer's deadline-driven surge.
Certain dealers fear the removal of the R135 000 tax credit will leave them burdened with unsold electric vehicles.","Speaking at a Detroit gathering recently, Ford chief executive, Jim Farley, described the development as ""a game-changer"", mere hours before the federal subsidy lapsed.

Farley indicated that he would not be surprised if electric car sales plummeted to just 5% of overall US vehicle sales next month. This figure represents approximately half the August level, a monthly high as buyers hastened to benefit from the credit and would rank among the weakest performances in recent years.

Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas, was equally pessimistic: ""The EV market is going to collapse in October."" Whilst Japan's Nissan continues launching a refreshed Nissan Leaf compact EV in the American market, Meunier anticipates intense rivalry as competing manufacturers battle to secure buyers for their electric vehicles.

""That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is an overabundance of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,"" Meunier remarked in an interview with Reuters.

The R135 000 tax credit was initially authorised by Congress in 2008 for electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle buyers. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act prolonged the incentive, though it simultaneously restricted eligibility to American-built EVs incorporating specified levels of domestically sourced batteries and components.

US President Donald Trump's tax-reduction and spending legislation, enacted in July, established the 30 September termination date. His administration has implemented additional measures potentially hampering EV momentum, including suspending penalties levied on car companies failing to meet fuel-efficiency standards. During last year's campaign, Trump pledged to terminate former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate"".

Research conducted jointly by academics from the universities of California, Berkeley, Duke and Stanford in November 2024 suggests electric vehicle registrations could decline by 27% in the absence of the tax credit.

The United States trails other principal automotive markets in EV uptake. In China, the world leader in electric vehicles and battery production, the combined sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have exceeded 40% in recent months. Europe's adoption rate has remained near 20%.

Despite the American tax incentive being available, electric car sales growth had already slowed over the previous two years, prior to this summer's deadline-driven surge. This deceleration occurred notwithstanding manufacturers introducing numerous new EV models.

The German government has begun preparations for the next round of its “climate contract” support scheme for industry decarbonisation. For the first time, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and utilisation (CCU) projects will be eligible to participate, the economy ministry said.

Germany aims to become climate neutral by 2045, but CO2 reductions in basic material industries such as steel, cement, paper, glass and chemicals are difficult to achieve, and entirely new and often expensive production methods are needed. With the help of so-called Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD), the government supports climate-friendly manufacturing by bridging the price gap with current carbon-intensive processes, allowing the companies to compete in international markets.

Companies must participate in the preparatory phase if they want to apply for support in the tender, which is expected to begin in mid-2026, the ministry said. During the preparatory phase, companies will also be consulted on the tender rules.

At the start of their term, the governing parties pledged to continue the pioneering ‘climate contracts’ programme of the previous German coalition government. In a first round, fifteen companies were awarded funding in October 2024.

The previous government had opened the preparatory phase for a second round of auctions in summer 2024, but the scheme was put on hold following the collapse of the coalition. Earlier this year, the European Commission gave the green light for the scheme based on state aid rules.

There were 18 items with some kind of measurable economic impact. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was the main agency of the week, providing the most significant regulatory and deregulatory actions of the haul. Across all rulemakings, agencies published roughly $1.9 billion in total costs and added roughly 228,000 paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 37

Final Rules: 97

2025 Total Pages: 48,012

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$74.8 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$628 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the rule from EPA regarding “Water Quality Standards To Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River.” In particular, the regulation sets “a designated use of protection and propagation of resident and migratory aquatic life and corresponding dissolved oxygen water quality criteria for the mainstem Delaware River in Zone 3, Zone 4, and the upper portion of Zone 5 (in total, river miles 108.4 to 70.0).” EPA issued the proposed version of the rule in 2023, making it an initiative that dates to the Biden Administration. As such, it is hardly surprising that it falls under the “regulatory” side of the ledger for the purposes of Executive Order (EO) 14192. The agency estimates that the rule’s requirements will involve $185.6 million in annualized costs to affected water safety authorities, or roughly $2.3 billion in present value over a 10-year period.

EPA also had a substantial deregulatory action, albeit, one that had more modest estimated cost reductions. The proposed rule on “Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category-Deadline Extensions,” would – as the title suggests – push back some deadlines established under a 2024 rule on the matter. The schedule of extensions is the following:

EPA projects that, under these implementation delays, “estimated annualized cost savings are $79 million to $215 million.” Taking the midpoint of that range means $147 million in annual savings, or roughly $386 million total across a three-year window.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

The ongoing government shutdown is, of course, more of a fiscal matter than a regulatory one. Nevertheless, it will have some impact on the administration’s broader regulatory policy agenda. With agencies generally shuttered, one can already see administrative actions slow to a crawl in the Federal Register. The length of this shutdown will be the primary determinant of how significant this downturn in regulatory activity will be. For instance, looking back to the weeks-long shutdown across 2018 and 2019, the Federal Register had what is likely the lightest issue on record on January 15, 2019, that amounted to a barely half-page notice extending a disaster relief filing deadline.

The only action on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front was from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introducing yet another series of resolutions of disapproval against Trump Administration rules – including one that seeks to repeal the Department of Interior’s rule on “Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness: Gulf of America.” The American Action Forum (AAF) CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 64 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

TOTAL BURDENS

Since January 1, the federal government has published $702.8 billion in total regulatory net cost savings (with $74.8 billion in cost savings from finalized rules) and 69.6 million hours of net annual paperwork cuts (with 48.1 million hours coming from final rules).",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dan-WIR.png,N,,2025-10-06 12:07:29.198206

“Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home,” the letter concluded.","Written from press release

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives this week urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize rules that prioritize domestic feedstocks and protect U.S. farmers and renewable fuel producers from foreign competition.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to move forward with its proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and to maintain record-high biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes set out earlier this year. They said the policy changes would strengthen American energy security and bolster farm economies across the Midwest.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks,” the members wrote. “The Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.”

The Import RIN reduction, proposed by the EPA in June, would cut in half the RIN credits available for imported renewable fuels or fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Lawmakers argue the move would help level the playing field for American producers facing competition from foreign sources such as Brazilian tallow and used cooking oil imported from China.

The letter also noted that soybean oil plays a key role in the U.S. biofuel industry — though it represents only 20% of the soybean by weight, it accounts for more than half the crop’s market value. About half of that oil is used to make biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“The EPA’s own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal,” the senators wrote. “It will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities.”

Joining Young in signing the letter were Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran of Kansas, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Rounds of South Dakota, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, among others.

Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives also endorsed the letter, including Indiana’s Jim Baird (IN-04), Erin Houchin (IN-09), Mark Messmer (IN-08), and Rudy Yakym (IN-02).

And while the president gets better marks on handling immigration and crime, both issues present potential problems as many Americans believe his administration is going too far. Focus groups and a limited number of new polls tell us that he has lost some ground among young people and minorities who voted for him. The president’s overall approval rating has been fairly steady recently, but that relative stability masks some worrying undercurrents, especially among political independents.

All this said, however, the Democrats aren’t exactly capturing voters’ hearts and minds. And, they still have trouble with their base. In the latest Economist/YouGov survey, 54% of Democrats approved of the job Senator Chuck Schumer was doing. Sixty-two percent of Republicans gave that response about House Republican leader Mike Johnson. A new Pew Research Center survey found that all four congressional leaders were viewed more negatively than positively. Pew noted that “Democrats now express more disapproval of their party’s congressional leadership than at any time in several decades,” while Republicans are more positive about theirs.

Off-year elections, where voter turnout is key, are still more than a year away, and that is an eternity in politics. But in the Economist/YouGov poll, independents, by a 10-point margin, said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress over the GOP one if the election were being held today, although many said they were unsure or wouldn’t vote.

It is worth looking at what we know about people who call themselves independents. A substantial amount of political science research shows that many in this large group actually lean to the Democratic or Republican parties and that only a small number are pure independents. A new CNN analysis of independents, building on a 2007 analysis from the Washington Post, KFF, and Harvard provides some insights into independents today and some clues about why they may be a particularly problematic group for the GOP as we move toward the off-year elections.

In the CNN analysis, 44% of people self-identified themselves as independents when asked the familiar question: In politics, as of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat or an independent? Of the remainder, roughly equal shares said they were Republicans (28%) and Democrats (27%). When the researchers started looking at the independent group as a whole, they found that 24% were Democratic “look-alikes” and 12% Republican ones. These are people who reject the party labels but actually align closely with one of the two parties. They also vote for candidates of the party they look like. As we have come to expect in recent elections, the Democratic lookalikes are more female than male, and the GOP lookalikes are more male than female. Both are mostly white. Slightly more than half of these soft Democrats call themselves progressives. About a third of the Republicans look-alikes say they align with MAGA.

The “Upbeat Outsiders” were 22% of the independent group. The largest age swath in this group are 30 to 49 years old. They don’t tune into politics and a large number of them say they haven’t voted in a decade. CNN calls them “true independents” and in this analysis, they leaned slightly more to Republicans than Democratic. But most don’t truly lean to either party.

The “Disappointed Middle” are 16% of the independents, and more than the other groups they hold unfavorable views of both parties. They still think it is important to participate. This group is more male than female and more white than other racial/ethnic groups.

The CHP systems will reduce utility costs and support the district’s long-term sustainability and resiliency goals by producing both electricity and heat.

The order was secured by Vergent Power Solutions, Capstone’s distributor for the Midwest and Northeast United States and Eastern Canada; it is expected to be commissioned by the end of October 2025. The project is a collaboration between Vergent and Veregy, a NAESCO-accredited, energy services company (ESCO).

“This repeat order from Veregy shows that microturbines are not just a one-off solution; they are a cornerstone of a long-term energy strategy,” said Justin Rathke, President of Vergent. “Their quiet operation and reliability make them an ideal fit for schools, and their ability to generate on-site power and heat helps clients like Valparaiso reduce costs and build a more resilient energy future.”

In 2020, the two companies partnered to bring a Capstone C65 system to Argos Community Schools in Indiana, which improved energy efficiency, lowered costs, and strengthened resiliency. The project exceeded all of its energy conservation goals after five years, the companies say.

The installations are the foundation of Valparaiso’s Phase 2 $17 million Guaranteed Energy Savings Contract (GESC), which includes solar, retro-commissioning, and other energy efficiency upgrades. The Phase 2 project supports the district’s sustainability efforts, which generated more than $7.6 million in projected energy savings over 12 years using solar arrays, LED lighting upgrades, HVAC enhancements, and real-time utility monitoring.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/10/68e3d222896fa9f3ffe3a07c-valparaiso_high_school_front.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-06 13:05:34.068235

“It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment.
To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.
“Europe’s wind industry has taken notice, and policymakers are mobilizing to help reduce the reliance on Chinese imports and beef up the domestic wind energy supply chain.
Officials hope such measures will encourage manufacturing buildouts while keeping costs in check,” said Andrea Scassola, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad Energy.","As the US aims to decouple from Chinese supply chains by doubling down on its domestic oil and gas resources, industries such as offshore wind have faced a barrage of economic challenges, from stop-work orders, to tax break rollbacks and rising inflationary costs. Despite unfavorable conditions in the US, Rystad Energy research shows new global offshore wind capacity will reach 16 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2025 due to projects already underway, with two thirds of them being developed in China. By 2030, Rystad Energy forecasts China’s offshore wind projects will claim 45% of the world’s cumulative capacity, making it difficult for the US market to compete in the long term, regardless of policy reversals.

“It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment. The US-China supply chain may be decoupled, but China’s position as a global renewables leader may have only been strengthened because of it,” said Alexander Fløtre, senior vice president and head of offshore wind research, Rystad Energy.

Some clear effects are already emerging. US renewable energy investments have plunged 36% year-on-year so far in 2025, whereas European investments are rising as companies redirect capital away from the US. Stop work orders were issued for both Orsted’s Rhode Island offshore wind development and Equinor’s New York project, with the latter reaching a deal that lifted the administration’s ban. A federal judge has reversed the order on Orsted’s Revolution project, with the question of a continued legal battle waiting to be answered. To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.

On the flipside, China-based CNOOC stated that it is staging its offshore wind portfolio expansion, with a key project in the 1.5 GW Hainan CZ7 aimed to be commissioned before 2030. The project is approved and is to be the first utility-scale project for CNOOC. For European energy companies with less US exposure, their reliance on China and other nations will only be enhanced.

The chances of creating an alternate, renewables-driven supply chain to compete with China are low, with Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) flocking back to the country’s favorable business environment after fleeing in 2020. The challenge is formidable: an analysis of turbine platforms with IEC-type certification commonly used across Europe, for example, reveals that approximately 25% of the manufacturing sites producing key components for Western OEMs are in China.

The Embark is built on an EV platform developed exclusively for the THOR family of companies by Harbinger Motors. THOR and Harbinger have been working together to develop the platform since 2022, and released some new technical details in April.

The Embark’s center-mounted 140 kWh battery pack delivers 105 miles of electric range—plenty for shorter trips or daily exploration. For longer hauls, it also incorporates a low-emission gasoline range extender that brings total range up to 450 miles.

Embark’s 800-volt electrical architecture allows for rapid charging at DC fast charger locations. The battery pack can also be charged using the traditional power hookups available at most campsites. The motorhome can serve as a mobile energy backup system to power a home in the case of a power outage.

Standard safety features include a backup camera with dynamic trajectory, front and rear ultrasonic collision warnings, and real-time tire pressure monitoring.

“Electrification will play a central role in the future of mobility, including RVing,” said THOR Industries President and CEO Bob Martin. “This first-of-its-kind [electrified] Class A motorhome reinforces THOR’s innovation leadership and offers unapparelled product differentiation for the Entegra Coach brand.”

Embark is now available for orders, and full production is to begin in 2026. Consumers interested in trying an electrified motorhome will be able to rent an Embark from THL in 2026.

The phaseout, brought on by the 2025 reconciliation law, hit the EV industry last week with the end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit last week he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5 percent after the tax credit ends from around 10 percent to 12 percent now.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller — way smaller than we thought — especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said. “We’re going to find out in a month.”

The tax credit rollback comes on top of the Trump administration’s revamp of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program created by the 2021 infrastructure law. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suspended the program in February, citing wasteful spending, and later relaunched with pared down standards.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said in a statement.

In an attempt to soften the blow, automakers Ford and General Motors Co. have plans to use their financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory, allowing the lending arms to qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.

Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and John Barrasso of Wyoming criticized the car companies’ plans, calling on the Treasury to close the automakers’ “loophole” and saying the plans are a “serious violation of Congressional intent.”

“These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off,” they wrote in a letter to the Treasury last week. “[IRS] guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.”

Despite automakers’ efforts to soften the hits to the EV industry, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an interview that the combination of the tax credit phaseout and rollback of other federal programs aimed at boosting battery manufacturing and production fares poorly for the industry.

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives. Now, she estimates it will be capped at 30 percent.

“It looks like the [auto] companies are going deeper into subprime, and that’s always an indication that sales in general are slowing … and they’re looking to keep the sales pace at a rate that allows them to maybe snowplow a little bit on total revenue,” she said. “We’ve seen several announcements now that these companies are delaying the product cycle for EVs.”

Renewables on deck

The 2025 reconciliation law also put new restrictions on renewable energy production and investment tax credits implemented under a 2022 reconciliation law, moving the timeline to qualify up by several years. Previously, projects needed to begin construction by the end of 2032. Now they must do so by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027, to take advantage of the federal support.

“This is an extremely tumultuous time,” said Bonnie Angermeier, senior legislative associate for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “There were promises made by the federal government, and there were strong signals for how they were going to support clean energy development.”

“Essentially, the rug got ripped out from under the clean energy industry,” she added.

Projects able to start construction before next July maintain eligibility for the credits for up to four years, Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said. SEIA is the national trade organization representing the solar and battery storage industry.

“The most advantageous position to be in right now is to qualify for that start of construction provision,” Gallagher said. “Companies that can’t qualify for that start of construction — they’ve got to get those projects online by the end of 2027, and so people are working hard to do that.”

Angermeier agreed, noting that companies focused on residential solar are at an even greater disadvantage.

“They have their pedal to the metal trying to complete projects as quickly as possible because they know that the window of that tax credit closes at the end of this year, which was highly unexpected and puts a ton of pressure on them,” she said.

She noted that the changes are “really throwing a wrench” into utility-scale projects as well, which generally rely on longer timelines to move from planning to completion. Some of those have been canceled as a result of the timeline shift, she added.

A solar markets report from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data and analytics for the renewables, energy and natural resources sectors, found that forecasts of new solar deployment through 2030 could be reduced by as much as 55 gigawatts as a result of federal policy changes this year.

Additional grant funding rescissions have also hit the industry hard as billions of dollars of previously allocated funds have been rescinded by the EPA, Department of Energy and other agencies, sometimes after they had already been dispersed.

Angermeier said the changes taken together have led to project cancellations, pauses, layoffs and the cancellation of new jobs that would have come with planned projects.

“We’re going to see a real restriction of new energy supply as a result of both the [reconciliation] bill and the and the administration’s action since the bill was enacted,” Gallagher said. “And of course, we’re seeing this restriction of new supply at a time when energy demand is booming.”

Wind and solar power have recently been among the fastest growing forms of new generation in the U.S., according to an August report from the Energy Information Administration.

While renewables are expected to account for much of the new generation forecast over the next two years, Gallagher said, “the outlook becomes a little bit hazier when you get out to ‘28 and ‘29.”

Even so, he’s not expecting a long-term chilling effect on the industry, because of continued market demand for renewable energy.

The Trump administration says it doesn’t take issue with renewable energy technologies, but with federal subsidies for them.

“Thirty-three years we’ve subsidized wind and solar power in the United States,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a late September press conference. “If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places.”

Wright and other officials say the administration prefers dense, baseload power that they say can respond to increasing energy demand. Wind and solar struggle with intermittency issues and are therefore less reliable than sources of power like natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, they say.

But supporters of renewable energy call that “hypocritical,” noting federal support for oil and gas projects. Renewables subsidies are “really more about creating an even playing field so that we can meet the demand that we have,” Angermeier said.

Gallagher called the administration’s arguments about reliability “tired,” citing the buildout of battery storage to support solar power.

“It was never really a legitimate criticism,” he said. “And it’s all the less so when we have energy storage that can deliver power reliably when the system needs it.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/barrasso_BC_202_042925.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:08.124992

Since the show is one of the largest in the country, those attending hope to visit with many of the buyers that do business in North Carolina and look for more ways to connect with the ever-changing industry.

“Keeping up with latest trends in all the areas of agriculture and personnel turnover in major players always helps our growers to be the industry leaders in growing and distributing fresh produce around the world,” Hardison said.

There’s a lot going on in the industry that the department is keeping an eye on.

“As always, our goals are to aid our growers in meeting their needs to be successful in their business. We do that through constant industry involvement and promotional campaigns throughout the state and country,” Hardison said. “Going into the fall, as with any grower, sights are set on the next growing season.”

Potatoes are one area that the department is keeping a close on.

Retail potato sales increased by 2.3 percent during the July 2024-June 2025 marketing year, reflecting “sustained consumer demand for this versatile, nutrient-dense vegetable,” according to Potatoes USA.

These sales volume increases were driven by fresh, frozen and deli-prepared sides categories, which increased by 2.6 percent, 3.7 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, the national industry marketing group said. Overall, US Potato sales totaled nearly 15.3 billion pounds in fresh weight equivalent, with the biggest categories being chips at more than 5.4 billion, fresh at more than 5.2 billion and frozen at more than 2.6 billion.

Matthew Luks, executive director of the NC Potato Association, noted big topics are dominated by continuing glances to the tariff changes and opening and closing of markets, especially in Asia.

“There are opportunities arising for potato sales to Central America, Africa and the Middle East as well,” he said. “There is focus on aligning the U.S. potato industry as a single voice through sign-on opportunities with other national potato organizations to ensure our voice is heard in the Farm Bill via our advocates with the National Potato Council and Potatoes USA.”

The NC Potato Association is coming up on its 100 year anniversary in 2028 and growers are looking toward the future of the industry in the state, while reflecting on the heritage and legacy of the potato industry.

“We have some great opportunities with our partnerships with the NC Department of Agriculture, Potatoes USA, the National Potato Council and the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, to really delve into what it is that makes our potato program here in North Carolina a special one, and that is our short burst of a season that so many chip and table stock markets rely on,” Luks said. “Continuing to adapt to environmental change and demonstrating resiliency in our industry is what makes our state great.

Under its Capacity*Connect proposal, Xcel Energy will install up to 200 MW of battery storage resources at strategic locations on the grid by 2028. Deployed in collaboration with Sparkfund, the distributed energy resources will help meet increasing demand for electricity, maintain reliable service for customers, maximize the efficiency of existing infrastructure and support local jobs.

“We’re focused on supporting economic growth and the needs of our communities by building out and modernizing our energy grid,” said Ryan Long, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. “We believe distributed energy resources are an important part of that strategy. They will complement our current plans for additional renewable and firm dispatchable generating resources to meet our customers’ needs.”

Xcel Energy’s approach takes advantage of its integrated system planning processes to determine the best customer locations to install the new battery storage resources. The company will integrate the battery storage into its system operations, charging the batteries during times when energy is inexpensive and dispatching that energy to serve all customers during periods of peak demand.

“By storing energy when it’s cheap, delivering it when it’s needed most and placing assets where they maximize grid value, Xcel Energy is delivering reliable energy to customers today and building a grid that is ready for tomorrow,” said Pier LaFarge, CEO of Sparkfund. “Sparkfund will help Xcel Energy deploy distributed energy resources to meet growing customer energy needs, support economic growth in Minnesota and unlock the full value of the U.S. electric grid.”

Battery storage is an important part of Minnesota’s energy future. Xcel Energy’s recently approved Upper Midwest Energy Plan calls for the installation of 600 MW of energy storage by the end of 2030. The proposed distributed capacity procurement will help achieve that goal, and Xcel Energy is bringing it forward to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission with the encouragement of many stakeholders.

Xcel Energy intends to locate the batteries at local businesses, commercial or industrial sites, or nonprofit organizations. This provides more customers — including those in environmental justice communities — with an opportunity to benefit financially from hosting clean energy technologies. Hosts would receive direct payments for participating in the program. Each site will have approximately 1 to 3 MW of storage (1 MW is about the size of a shipping container).

Xcel Energy, in collaboration with Sparkfund, will scale the deployment so the grid can keep pace with increasing demand while prioritizing local workers and complying with the company’s labor standards. Xcel Energy will operate each battery storage asset to maintain safety and security of the system.

With this approach, Xcel Energy and Sparkfund will closely review performance, costs and customer experience as the program grows, ensuring it is cost-effective while supporting a clean, reliable and safe grid.

“The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.” No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25276658907776.41w1FKiQVM.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:49.763611

“Affordable access to solar is vital as part of the long-term solution to meeting the Act on Climate goals in Rhode Island while not leaving low-income Rhode Islanders behind.","From a press release:

Attorneys for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Rhode Island Center for Justice (RICJ), along with a group of businesses and nonprofits from across the nation, sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today to reverse the Trump administration’s illegal termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program, a program designated by Congress to save money for Rhode Island’s consumers while providing union jobs for Rhode Island workers.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s decision to terminate all funding for the Solar for All program. Local attorneys representing the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government, and the Conservation Law Foundation filed the suit.

Plaintiffs include the RI AFL-CIO, which was relying on Solar for All to expand renewable and cheaper power while ensuring high-quality union careers for a new generation. RI AFL-CIO invested time and money in developing training and apprenticeship programs to increase the implementation of solar energy. The RI Center for Justice is also joining the challenge as a nonprofit working to lower the high cost of electricity for low-income consumers and to provide sustainable, uninterrupted access to vital electricity in their homes by preventing their utilities from being shut off.

“Solar energy is key to Rhode Island’s march towards a carbon-free economy. The Solar for All program is critical to meeting the mandates of the Act on Climate and could lead to hundreds of good-paying union jobs. That is why the Rhode Island AFL-CIO is happy to join this court action,” said Patrick Crowley, President of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. “Our members want this program back up and running as soon as possible.”

“Our clients are struggling with unaffordable electric bills and facing a cycle of shut-offs that puts the health and safety of utility customers, including those who are elderly and living with disabilities, at risk,” said Jennifer L. Wood, Executive Director of Rhode Island Center for Justice. “Affordable access to solar is vital as part of the long-term solution to meeting the Act on Climate goals in Rhode Island while not leaving low-income Rhode Islanders behind. We need this program reinstated so our clients can be included in the benefits of solar energy ‘for all.’”

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” said Amy R. Romero, Chief Legal Counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island. “EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy security in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

Before EPA’s abrupt termination of the Solar for All program in August 2025, the EPA obligated $7 billion in grant funding that Congress had directed to provide to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits across the country to develop long-lasting solar energy programs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. According to the EPA, the average low-income household benefiting from the Solar for All grant program would have saved about $400 each year from their electricity bills. Programs funded by Solar for All would have created hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs all across the country. Additionally, the EPA estimated that the Solar for All program would have cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, equal to the emissions of over seven million passenger vehicles.

While a subsequent Congress repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, it explicitly did not repeal the Solar for All program retroactively, rescinding only “unobligated balances.” Yet instead of distributing the Solar for All funds as Congress mandated, the EPA unlawfully announced the termination of the Solar for All program, which will result in the loss of access to affordable solar energy in nearly a million low-income households and the loss of good-paying, high-quality jobs, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities that Congress intended these funds to benefit.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FJun!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147fd6af-1fbf-4685-b4e7-4c9b9cbfd2ea_1500x844.jpeg",N,,2025-10-06 12:07:49.809630

By Apex Clean Energy

Apex Clean Energy is proud to bring Big Bluestem Wind to Henry County, a project designed to deliver clean, reliable electricity while creating long-term economic opportunity for local families, schools, and communities. And despite recent changes in federal legislation — including the phase-out of tax credits and new executive orders — one thing remains steady: renewable energy is the cheapest form of power generation Americans can put on the grid — with or without subsidies.

Built to Last—With or Without Subsidies

Recent federal actions like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Executive Order 14315 have tightened rules around renewable energy tax credits. But here’s the truth: Wind Energy doesn’t depend on subsidies to succeed.

–Economics First: Wind and solar energy are now the most affordable sources of electricity on the grid—even without federal incentives. According to Lazard, wind has seen a cost reduction of 85% over the last 25 years due to innovations in turbine technology, plus markets of scale and improved siting.

–A Technology Improving for You: It’s not just the cost of wind farms that’s better now. Many of the technological innovations in wind energy have improved the experience of living near a wind farm. Serrated turbine blade edges and variable-speed operation both minimize noise. Fewer, taller turbines declutter the view. And the use of Aircraft Detection Lighting Systems (ADLS), on today’s turbines means you won’t see blinking lights unless a plane flies nearby.

—Not Affected by Offshore or Public Land Restrictions: Executive orders restricting the siting of wind energy only apply to offshore wind and the leasing of federal land. Apex is a private company developing projects by leasing private land in accordance with state and local laws.

Jobs, Revenue, and Local Investment

Renewable energy projects like Big Bluestem Wind can be real, homegrown economic drivers.

–Jobs for Local Workers: Big Bluestem will create hundreds of well-paid construction jobs for Illinois laborers, and up to 12 full-time careers.

–Revenue for Schools and Services: Over its lifespan, Big Bluestem will generate $95 million in property tax revenue for schools, fire districts, libraries, and county services. Over $55 million of that will go to local school districts.

–Reliable Lease Payments: Participating landowners will receive annual payments, helping families plan for the future with confidence.

In Illinois alone, Apex projects in development represent over $7.9 billion in projected investment, $66 million in annual payments to landowners, nearly $1.2 billion in local tax revenue during the first 30 years, and over 3.9 gigawatts of homegrown, pollution-free energy.

Meeting Illinois’s Growing Energy Needs

America needs more power. A 2024 survey of 100,000 Americans by Ernst Young found that two-thirds of Americans could not afford a 10% increase in their energy costs, yet prices for consumers are going up as data centers, AI, electrification, and industrial growth drive unprecedented demand. An “all of the above” strategy is needed to deliver more power to the grid, and renewable energy projects like Big Bluestem Wind are doing their part. 95% of projects in the United States in line to be permitted and built are solar, storage, and wind and according to Time, clean power projects can alleviate price pressure on the grid.

But there is one bright spot in the current moment: EV charger growth is accelerating, and believe it or not, the very same Trump administration is helping to make it happen.

This unusual situation kicks off our Monday edition of Critical Materials, our morning roundup of industry and technology news. Also on deck today: Stellantis' struggling U.S. brands stand to get a big capital investment, and how all of Elon Musk's companies have a burnout problem.

30%: Trump Fails To Kill NEVI Funding, Speeds It Up Instead

Longtime readers of this publication and industry pros probably know the acronym NEVI: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the program allocated $5 billion in funding for DC fast chargers for states to dole out in the form of grant money. As part of its anti-green energy and cost-cutting push, the Trump administration sought to cancel that funding, but a federal court overruled that move in July.

Since then, Politico reports, more than 40 states are in the process of unlocking their NEVI funding—and red states like Texas and Montana lead the way. At least 32 say they have gotten a green light. And Trump's Department of Transportation actually seems to be offering more flexibility on where these chargers can be placed.

The publication calls this ""a major acceleration."" More on why, with emphasis mine below:

The new guidance that DOT issued in August largely kept the Biden administration’s rules but ditched a contentious requirement that chargers be placed every 50 miles along major highways. It also directed states to quickly submit updated implementation plans to access the funds. In the weeks since, at least 44 states and Washington, D.C., have submitted their plans, spokespeople for those states told POLITICO.

In a statement Friday, DOT spokesperson Nathaniel Sizemore said the Biden administration had added requirements to NEVI that were “difficult to understand and implement,” and that the huge amount of money that remained unobligated when the former president left office was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”

“Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient,” Sizemore said. “If a [state’s] submitted plan meets the requirements detailed in the updated program guidance, it will be approved and the State’s NEVI funding will be made available for obligation.”

State and industry officials said the rush to access the money was due to both pent-up enthusiasm for the charger cash and a positive reception to the flexibility offered under the new rules.

“We’re already seeing states reengage and move more quickly toward accessing funds,” said David Piperno, chief financial officer at SparkCharge, an EV fleet charging provider. “The overall tone has shifted and there’s a new urgency to put these dollars to work.”

One transportation official told Politico that the strategic placement of chargers in America is about to get better, and at more gas stations and existing stops, because there's no longer this arbitrary 50-mile requirement. That was often very difficult to implement in, say, places like Alaska, which might have 80-mile stretches of rural highway with no communities along the way.

So, to recap: Trump tried to cancel EV charger funding, failed, declined to appeal in court, and has somehow put new rules in place that may actually be cutting red tape around deployment. What a time to be alive.

More from that story:

But it also reflects a growing reality: Millions of EVs are expected to hit the road in the coming years, regardless of Trump’s policies. And their drivers are going to need places to charge.

“If you look at the states that are putting their [charging] plans and their money back into play the soonest, it’s really states that recognize their EV adoption rate is going to continue to climb,” said Joshua Rodriguez, program director for environment at the nonpartisan American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Red or blue or purple, it doesn’t really matter.”

It's a good sign that, tax credits or no, you can't stop progress.

60%: Stellantis' U.S. Brands Could Get A Big Capital Boost

One major criticism of Stellantis’ former CEO is that he steered capital and R&D investments toward the wrong brands within the European-American conglomerate. American brands like Jeep and Ram make much of Stellantis' revenue, yet they've been dealing with overpriced and aging lineups for years. (I am not saying this magically would've prevented those brands from making lackluster EVs, but it certainly didn't help.)

According to a new report, that could change soon. Bloomberg indicates Stellantis' American brands are about to get a major boost:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants—for re-openings, hiring and new models—in states including Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

[...] The new CEO has started scrapping some European investments, withdrawing support from a joint hydrogen fuel cell venture with Michelin and Forvia SE. Stellantis also is mulling a sale of its Free2move car-sharing business, Bloomberg reported this week. Earlier this year, the automaker hired McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice on Maserati and Alfa Romeo. It has repeatedly denied any plans to sell Maserati.

This U.S. focus makes sense for several reasons. For one, it's Stellantis going where the money is; its sales are lagging in Europe, and it faces severe factory overcapacity there too. And Jeep, Ram and even Dodge are what pay a lot of the bills. Plus, the American investments are necessary at a time when the company is getting hammered by Trump tariffs.

With any luck, this will also mean better U.S. investments into, at the very least, hybrid powertrains. Stellantis can't bet on V8 engines to win the future.

90%: Elon Musk's Turnover Problem

You can't really disrupt an industry the way Tesla did without busting your ass. But one problem within the company is that it still runs at the pace of an early-stage startup, and this has led to rapid-fire turnover that's somehow accelerated in recent years.

The Financial Times (subscription required) has the scoop on the burnout factor at Tesla, which is now endemic to Musk's other companies too:

Important members of Tesla’s US sales team, battery and power-train operations, public affairs arm, and its chief information officer have all recently departed, as well as core members of the Optimus robot and artificial intelligence teams on which Musk has bet the future of the company.

While many left happily after long service to found start-ups or take career breaks, there has also been an uptick in those quitting from burnout, or disillusionment with Musk’s strategic pivots, mass lay-offs and his politics, the people said.

“The one constant in Elon’s world is how quickly he burns through deputies,” said one of the billionaire’s advisers. “Even the board jokes, there’s time and then there’s ‘Tesla time’. It’s a 24/7 campaign-style work ethos. Not everyone is cut out for that.”

Robert Keele, xAI’s general counsel, ended his 16-month tenure in early August by posting an AI-generated video of a suited lawyer screaming while shovelling molten coal. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough,” he commented.

It's certainly not news that working for Musk can be brutal. But this situation is also intertwined with Tesla's apparent pivot away from building newer and cheaper EVs, and more to the unproven spaces of robotics and AI, the story notes:

Tesla has traditionally been the most stable part of Musk’s conglomerate. But many of the top team left after it culled 14,000 jobs in April 2024. Some departures were triggered as Musk moved investment away from new electric vehicle and battery projects that many employees saw as key to its mission of reducing global emissions—and prioritised robotics, AI and self-driving robotaxis.

Employees also perceive Musk’s rivalry with [Sam] Altman—with whom he co-founded OpenAI, before they fell out — to be behind the pressure being put on staff.

“Elon’s got a chip on his shoulder from ChatGPT and is spending every waking moment trying to put Sam out of business,” said one recent top departee.

I suppose we'll see what this era of Tesla is really capable of with tomorrow's reveal of the allegedly cheaper Model Y variant.

100%: How Much EV Charging Does America Need?

If you say ""more than we have now,"" I'd certainly agree there. And I also think the U.S. over-indexes on DC fast-charging when it could stand to have more slower Level 2 charging everywhere, from movie theater parking lots to apartment complexes.

But let's imagine the future when we're past this current moment and EVs are at a tipping point. When do we hit ""enough"" public EV chargers? And what does that even look like?

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

""We're not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we're not going to take risk,"" said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet ""delusional"" green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That's enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

""This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,"" Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way ""to protect us until we know more,"" said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

""They're banking on nothing happening, but I don't think you can place it where they're proposing and assume nothing's going to happen,"" Sokolowski said. ""It's just too risky if it does.""

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system ""poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.""

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will ""strengthen and modernize our grid.""

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/energy.RcWqRjWyCI.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.55&fp-y=0.38&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:37.836833

This includes life-cycle assessments and product-carbon footprints, which rely on emissions data from facilities upstream in the value chain.
Projects totaling $77 billion in capital expenditures plan on making use of 45Q, but companies need to access data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to claim the credit.
“Canceling the greenhouse gas reporting program means you can’t get 45Q,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm.
Companies would still need to collect emissions data to comply with state regulations, demands from investors and requirements from countries they export to.","A foundational data source that shapes the work of sustainability professionals across multiple sectors will disappear if the Trump administration goes ahead with plans to scrap the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, critics of the move warn.

The program, run since 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency, requires around 8,000 oil refineries, power plants and other industrial facilities to submit annual emissions reports to the agency. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin proposed scrapping the program last month, describing it as “nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

Sustainability professionals see it differently.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program matters to everyone, not just the companies that report,” said Sean Hackett, senior manager for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s the most comprehensive source of emissions data. It underpins investor confidence, regulatory oversight and supply chain accountability across the economy.”

“The corporate world has built sustainability and investment plans around all it does,” added John Milko, senior managing policy advisor at Carbon180, a carbon removal nonprofit.

Cascading impacts

Ending the program would trigger a cascade of negative impacts, they and others warn, because the program provides a standardized data set that feeds into work across the economy. This includes life-cycle assessments and product-carbon footprints, which rely on emissions data from facilities upstream in the value chain.

In construction, for example, companies building data centers and other facilities are increasingly demanding that low-carbon steel and concrete be used. “We want to move to a system that improves the calculations of that embodied carbon,” said Milko. “Shuttering the largest-scale program that is seeking to standardize that data is counterproductive to the sustainability goals of large corporations.”

The move also places billions of dollars of announced investments in carbon removal in jeopardy, including direct air capture projects and plans to capture and store emissions from industrial facilities. The economics of these projects rely on a tax credit known as 45Q, which was made more valuable in 2022. Projects totaling $77 billion in capital expenditures plan on making use of 45Q, but companies need to access data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to claim the credit.

“Canceling the greenhouse gas reporting program means you can’t get 45Q,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm. “Whether this is intentional or accidental, it’s very bad. It will chill investment, cost time and money and impair trade.”

Increased costs and complexity

Zeldin framed his proposal as a move that would save businesses billions of dollars by cutting regulatory burdens, but experts warn of increased costs to businesses that report to the program. Companies would still need to collect emissions data to comply with state regulations, demands from investors and requirements from countries they export to. “Without that federal baseline, companies would face a patchwork of state and voluntary programs that would increase costs, uncertainty and complexity,” said Hackett.

Companies wishing to comment on the EPA’s proposal have until Nov. 3 to share feedback. To learn more before commenting, Trellis recommends the following briefings:",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Shutterstock-Image-1726542784.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:07:55.879614

Well, it sounds like the White House might be considering offsetting tariff costs for manufacturers who build cars in the United States.
I’d dump DS, but if you get rid of Maserati then maybe DS can do what Chrysler is going to do in the United States (no V8s for Europe, though).

“It’s the preciseness and controllability of the powerful engines in these powerful cars.” I like the way that sounds.","All I’ve ever wanted is for the now-Stellantis brands to live up to their potential. It’s not about getting specific vehicles (I can accept that the Hellcat-powered Pacifica probably ain’t happening). These are important carmakers, and each has a role in the greater marketplace. In particular, I’ve harped a lot on Stellantis for letting Chrysler and Dodge wither on the vine, but it comes from a place of caring.

It’s why a new report hinting that Stellantis may be trying to help those brands out is music to my ears. This is good news, and I’m feeling like I need to make The Morning Dump a little more positive after Archie Manning disappointed the Longhorn faithful again this weekend.

Other good news? Well, it sounds like the White House might be considering offsetting tariff costs for manufacturers who build cars in the United States. What’s that going to look like? No one knows! How will that work? See the previous answer.

BYD doesn’t have to worry about U.S. tariffs at the moment, and it can now officially celebrate besting Tesla for four straight quarters in EV sales. In five years, that might look like when the Red Sox beat up on the Astros earlier this season. It doesn’t matter anymore!

And, finally, Genesis has established itself as a real player in the luxury space. The next move? Show it can build a performance identity.

How To Fix Stellantis, Redux

I have never been even partially responsible for a company that’s built a car. When David finishes the Jeep, I suppose that’ll change. Until then, I understand why you’d wonder where I get off telling car execs what they’re doing wrong. Sure. Fair.

Though, in the case of Stellantis, I specifically pointed out all the reasons why I thought the company was in bad shape, even after reporting huge profits. Stellantis shuffled off its CEO less than a year later, for many of the reasons that I identified, and the company has swung from big profits to losses.

I think I like the new guy, Anthonio Filosa, or at the very least, I think he’s saying the right things and deserves some time to try and get it right. According to a new report from Bloomberg, he’s maybe going to get a lot right:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing information that’s not public. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants — including re-openings, hiring and new models — in states such as Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

Stellantis is focused on reclaiming the past success of the Jeep brand and is considering fresh investments into Dodge, which could result in a new Dodge V8 muscle car, and possibly even the Chrysler brand in the long term, some of the people said. Talks are ongoing, no final decision has been made and the amount and targeted projects could still change, the people said.

I guess it’s time to play the “Re-Build Stellantis Plan Waltz” one more time:

Jeep: A top and bottom approach. The most important brand, so give engineers more money and fight back against Bronco with a more modern Wrangler. At the same time, more volume hybrids that looks good.

Ram: I still think putting it under Dodge is smart, but in lieu of that: A midsize hybrid truck, which the company has basically said will happen.

Dodge: Muscle car? Sure. A replacement for the Durango is also key, and an entry-level crossover that can compete with the HR-Vs of the world. Maybe something French?

Chrysler: Literally, anything that’s not a van. More specifically, make it your luxury brand, build a luxury car and a luxury SUV. And, when you do that, you should also…

Kick The Italian Brands Out Of The US: You can’t do everything at once. Sergio’s dream was a great dream, but it wasn’t implemented properly. Sell Maserati (I know, I know, “it’s not for sale,” but sell it). Keep Alfa for Europe. Keep Fiat for Europe. I don’t care what you do with Lancia.

Keep Peugeot And Citroën, Dump DS: I love the French brands, and I can’t pretend like I don’t (I probably am emotionally invested in Lancia’s outcome a little). The French government owns a big chunk of the company, so there’s really no choice here. I’d dump DS, but if you get rid of Maserati then maybe DS can do what Chrysler is going to do in the United States (no V8s for Europe, though).

Leapmotor: Seems fine!

This gets way more complicated in practice.

Obviously, the UAW loves this plan. The White House is going to love this plan. The Italian government is going to hate it. You can’t make everyone happy, and Stellantis doesn’t have unlimited money.

After a lot of back-and-forth, the Tavares-run Stellantis committed itself to spending more in Europe. But with the company cutting back across the continent due to overcapacity, I don’t get how that’s going to work.

It sounds like Filosa is going to meet with the Italian unions later this month. Oh, to be a mosca on that wall.

The Anti-Inflation White House Allegedly Wants To Address Car Price Inflation

Inflation became such a bad word that President Biden named his signature piece of legislation the Inflation Reduction Act. I’m not sure how much reduction of inflation actually occurred, and it’s clear that the price of eggs had a lot to do with the election of President Trump.

Tariffs are historically inflationary, and it’s only a matter of time before companies raise prices to offset tariffs. Unless, unless… the White House does something to reverse or offset them.

Here’s Senator Bernie Moreno–a car dealer–explaining how this might work in a Reuters exclusive:

“The signal to the car companies around the world is look, you have final assembly in the U.S.: we’re going to reward you,” Moreno said in an interview. “For Ford, for Toyota, for Honda, for Tesla, for GM, those are the almost in order the top five domestic content vehicle producers – they’ll be immune to tariffs.”

[…]

Moreno added automakers with significant final production in the United States should get tariff breaks: “Look, at the end of the day, they’re doing exactly we want them to do – paying employees in America well and doing final assembly in the United States with the cars that they sell here.”

Asked for comment on the proposal, a White House official told Reuters that Trump and the administration “are committed to a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to securing domestic auto and auto parts production. Until any official action is signed by the president, however, any discussion about administration policymaking is speculative.”

I love the “almost in order” there. I guess it depends on which measure you’re looking at, but I assume somewhere in Senator Moreno’s mind he was aware that this is not the correct order. It doesn’t really matter because the concept is sound. If you want more manufacturing in the United States, then the automakers who build here should get some sort of tariff relief.

What this means in Realityville is another question.

The biggest sticking point is probably Canada and Mexico. President Trump clearly doesn’t love that there’s production in those places, but he was the one who wrote the most recent treaty (USCMA) that continued to make it efficient for companies to do so…

Will automakers like Toyota and Honda get a 1:1 discount on imported cars for every car built here? Or are automakers going to get a break if there’s “final assembly” and that means some parts made in Canada are fine? One of the biggest obstacles to building cars efficiently in the United States is the steel and aluminum tariffs, so will automakers get a break from that?

Again, the form that this takes is extremely important.

I’m torn on how to think about some of this. On one hand, President Biden and the Democrats have made a big deal out of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, and no small portion of the plants that carmakers are bragging about are ones that were already going to be built because of Biden-era policies. On the other hand, Democrats seemed mostly content to let the USMCA status quo continue (they might argue that one way to slow cross-border immigration is improve Mexico’s economy and allow more jobs there).

It likely makes sense for automakers to shift as much manufacturing here from overseas as they can because Democrats will probably take credit for the plants being built/planned if they somehow win back the White House in a few years. You think any Democrat President, on the off chance it happens, is going to ship the jobs back?

BYD Beats Tesla For Fourth Straight Quarter

Tesla v. BYD is potentially not the best framing for the Chinese car market over the long term, but it has some value in the moment. The fact that BYD has now gone a year straight selling more electric cars globally is a not-small detail, especially given that BYD doesn’t have the same market access that Tesla has.

It’s also interesting because Tesla and BYD both seem in trouble in China according to this Bloomberg article:

BYD is losing momentum in its home market, where policymakers are increasingly concerned about destructive competition. Tesla will have trouble replicating last quarter’s showing now that the US has phased out federal tax credits supporting EV purchases.

China’s government has sought to temper cutthroat competitive practices in the world’s biggest car market, where manufacturers have waged a relentless price war since early 2023. BYD has been at the fore of the discounting trend and in late August reported a surprise 30% drop in quarterly profit.

Both BYD and Tesla are more than capable of overcoming these challenges, although only BYD seems truly interested in building better cars. Tesla seems more into robots right now.

‘Driving Control, Precision, And Confidence’ Will Define The Future Of Genesis Performance Cars

I’ve written about this before, so I will try not to retread too much.

The larger automaker known as Hyundai went on a bit of a buying spree about a decade ago, bringing on some of the best designers and engineers from peak-era Germany. It’s how we ended up with the guy behind the best M cars tuning Velosters, and the guy who designed some of the best Audis, transforming Genesis into a real luxury player.

The Hyundai N cars are never quite the fastest, but damn if they don’t just feel right.

Genesis also has a host of highly competitive vehicles (I encouraged a friend to test one, and he fell in love), but it’s apparently not enough to merely make nice cars. What’s missing, according to the company, is a sense of true performance. That’s where the company’s Magma performance brand comes in.

BTW, let’s please recognize how metal that name is: MAGMA. I’m pretty sure I saw them open for Rob Zombie at L’Amour.

A big part of MAGMA’s mission will be planned by Manfred Harrer, head of the Vehicle Development Technology Unit at Hyundai (and ex- of Porsche, BMW, Audi, Apple…). Here’s what he told Automotive News what’s key to making this work:

“In my eyes, we have one gap with the brand and the brand image, and that’s the performance part,” Harrer said in a separate interview at the automaker’s Namyang R&D center south of Seoul.

“And this should be covered by our new Genesis Magma lineup.”

Part of the Magma proposition will be raw power and torque, acceleration and top speed, Harrer said. But the differentiator, he said, will be driving control, precision and confidence.

“This is the philosophy, from an engineering standpoint,” said Harrer, who previously worked on Apple’s discontinued electric vehicle project and earlier at Porsche, BMW and Audi. “It’s the preciseness and controllability of the powerful engines in these powerful cars.”

I like the way that sounds. Pure power is getting super boring, and while it’s not like AMG is just handing out 1,000 HP cars (that’s what SRT is for), I think N is a good example of Hyundai prioritizing feel over numbers.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

If you don’t have a daughter or, maybe, you don’t have ears, you may be unaware there’s another Taylor Swift album that just dropped on Friday. I don’t love it. I respect that she puts out a bunch of music and tries things. It’s also not really for me, sure, but as an enjoyer of the odd pop tune, I don’t think it’s doing anything new. Both the latest Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX album feel like they’re doing a lot more.

Oh, right. Sabrina Carpenter shows up on this album on the titular track and is predictably one of the better ones. The best song on the album thus far is probably “Actually Romantic.” People who care more than I do seem to think this is about Charli XCX, and I think that’s probably right (inasmuch as the song is about any one person and not about a few individuals, like the people in New York Magazine).

I suppose Charli fired the first shot with “Sympathy is a Knife,” but that song feels like less of a diss track and more just an artist sharing her own feelings of inadequacy? This kinda feels like punching down. Also, it’s pop music, it doesn’t matter.

With demand trends and supply chain challenges putting pressure on the electric vehicle (EV) industry, ITS aims to offer manufacturers and Tier 1 automakers safe, compliance-ready, and scalable operations tailored to today’s market.

“The EV transition is still accelerating, but companies are now facing headwinds that could cause significant demand fluctuation,” explained Kasia Wenker, VP of Solutions Engineering at ITS Logistics. “In this type of environment, a fixed facility optimized for the lowest cost during ideal conditions quickly becomes a liability. The flexibility to scale with demand while maintaining operational excellence is the real key to protecting against risk.”

The EV battery market has seen exceptional volatility over the past year, with geopolitical tension influencing both supply and demand. Tariffs on rare earth minerals as well as lithium-ion cells represent a threat to domestic EV battery production. Additionally, the rollback of the federal EV tax credit, which offered consumers up to $7,500 in tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, is expected to decrease EV sales in the short term. Still, market optimism persists. Despite uncertainty, BloombergNEF forecasts U.S. EV passenger vehicle sales to more than double by 2030, representing 27% of total passenger car sales. While automakers anticipate a slight correction following record-high sales in August, most experts agree consumers will continue to purchase EVs for their environmental benefits and lower gasoline costs. For now, many brands are augmenting their strategy to include a mix of hybrid and ICE models in addition to all-electric vehicles.

“Current market dynamics, and the reactions we’ve seen from automakers so far, underscore a clear truth: to remain profitable in uncertainty, you must embrace flexibility — without compromising safety or compliance,” Wenker continued.

Lithium-ion batteries are high-value, hazardous, and subject to strict oversight across transport and storage. They require compliance with DOT and IMDG regulations in transit, and must meet NFPA 855, FM Global, and insurer requirements in storage. Variations in chemistry, packaging, and state-of-charge add operational complexity that traditional logistics networks can struggle to adapt to real-time demand and customer needs.

To address this, ITS Logistics has developed multi-tenant, campus-style Battery Hubs in Indianapolis and Dallas, designed to flex capacity up or down as demand shifts, support new model launches or recalls, and provide geographic diversity across the U.S. for regional agility. The network balances flexibility with critical needs for battery supply chains, including:

• Fire suppression and environmental monitoring systems designed specifically for lithium-ion risk and aligned with upcoming regulatory changes.

• Boots-on-the-ground, extensively trained operators and hazmat-certified staff executing battery-specific procedures and compliance documentation.

• FTZ-ready space for managing imports, completing assembly tasks, and protecting cash flow.

• Integrated hazmat-certified transportation across road, intermodal, and drayage, seamlessly coordinated with warehousing to reduce handoffs and delays.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Battery_Hub_PR.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:31.842539

But in the lawsuit, the coalition argued that the bill revoked only climate grants that the E.P.A.
Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A.","A coalition of solar energy companies, labor unions, nonprofit groups and homeowners sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday over its termination of $7 billion in grants intended to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels on their homes.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, accused the agency of illegally revoking the money under the Solar for All program without congressional approval. It expanded an ever-widening legal battle over President Trump’s efforts to claw back billions of dollars in climate funding that had been approved by the Biden administration.

The lead plaintiff is the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a group of labor unions that had trained electricians and other workers to install solar panels in the state. While the unions did not directly receive funds under the Solar for All program, they had been counting on work that would have followed a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.

“Now that the program is on hold, potentially hundreds of job opportunities are lost,” said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. He said the Trump administration had jeopardized hundreds of additional jobs for his members by ordering work to halt on several wind farms off the coast of New England.

“It’s not just a one-two punch to the work force that I represent,” Mr. Crowley said. “It really is a one-two punch to the entire state of Rhode Island because our energy costs need to be controlled, and renewable energy sources like solar and wind are a key component of that.”

Other plaintiffs include a homeowner in Atlanta who had applied for free rooftop solar panels from an initiative supported by a $156 million grant to the Georgia Bright Communities Coalition and companies that install solar panels in Georgia and Pennsylvania.

The plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit legal advocacy groups including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Lawyers for Good Government. Brigit Hirsch, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit, citing an agency policy of not commenting on pending litigation.

The Solar for All program was not only intended to help low- and moderate-income homeowners. It was also meant to expand community solar initiatives, which bring solar energy to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own panels.

The program was projected to help 900,000 households get access to solar power, according to estimates by the Biden administration. The idea was to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the leading driver of climate change, while also helping to lower electricity bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save $350 million each year on utility costs.

Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in August that he was ending the Solar for All program at the behest of Congress. He said that Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill, which Congress passed in July, had eliminated what he called “billions of green slush fund dollars” under Solar for All.

“The bottom line again is this: E.P.A. no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Mr. Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.

But in the lawsuit, the coalition argued that the bill revoked only climate grants that the E.P.A. had not yet awarded. Under the Biden administration, the agency had awarded the Solar for All grants to 60 state agencies, nonprofit groups and Native American tribes.

The claim that the bill rescinded the Solar for All grants is “patently false and legally unsupportable,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government.

The Solar for All program was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature climate law. The measure authorized a total of $27 billion in grants for green activities like installing electric vehicle charging stations and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.

Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A. In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the Trump administration had acted legally in its attempts to claw back the funds.

Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, said that because the case was essentially a dispute between the government and grant recipients, it belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit filed Monday is unlikely to face a similar setback, legal experts said, since it was not brought by the grant recipients.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/01cli-solar-lawsuit/01cli-solar-lawsuit-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:04:51.647725

Trump Brings Fossil Fuel, Far-Right Think Tank Agenda To Government

An analysis of over 100 staffers' backgrounds reveals Texas oil money takeover of Trump administration, deep ties to fossil fuel industry and far right think tanks; Polluters get ‘concierge, white glove service’

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has installed more than 100 fossil fuel insiders, renewable energy opponents, corporate lobbyists, and far-right think tank alumni across nine agencies during his second term, according to a new analysis of the backgrounds of staffers appointed to roles in the administration.

The analysis by Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project of 111 officials identified:

43 former fossil fuel industry employees

29 former corporate executives

14 former corporate lawyers

12 people tied to fossil fuel-funded right-wing think tanks

7 people tied primarily to Republican politics such as elected officials and staffers pushing a fossil fuel or corporate agenda

6 from utility companies or the nuclear energy industry

The analysis also found that more than two-thirds (25 out of 37) of staff nominated to Senate-confirmable jobs at the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of the Interior had ties to polluting interests.

The agencies have made dozens of hires from the fossil fuel sector and other polluting industries, as well as corporate lawyers and far-right think tank alumni who are enacting Trump’s policies designed to promote dirty energy and destroy America’s public lands.

The report details comments by a White House staffer speaking on an energy lobbyist’s podcast, stating the Trump administration is providing “concierge, white glove service” to dirty energy companies pushing pipelines, mining projects, and export terminals.

The report highlights the expansive influence of the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the America First Policy Institute in staffing the second Trump administration. Both of the far-right think tanks are funded by the Texas oil billionaire Tim Dunn, and have created a pipeline of Trump staffers to implement an extreme, pro-fossil fuel agenda.

The ascent of Dunn and other allied Texas donors represents a changing of the guard from the libertarian Koch network, which had extensive influence on the first Trump administration, yet has parted ways on some issues, such as Trump’s tariffs.

“This is nothing short of a Texas oil industry takeover of the U.S. government at the expense of consumers, the climate, public health, and public lands and waters,” said Alan Zibel, a research director with Public Citizen and a co-author of the report. “To execute his extreme, reckless, backward-looking fossil fuel agenda, Trump has stocked his administration with fossil fuel staffers and ideologues,”

“Texas-based billionaires have taken over the Trump administration, providing a steady stream of staffers and an extreme set of policy ideas that consciously favors the most polluting forms of energy,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, senior researcher with the Revolving Door Project. “Trump’s policies aid the fossil fuel industry’s exploitation of the public sphere for private profit while simultaneously sabotaging renewables and ensuring that the U.S. remains trapped in a dirty energy economy.”

At the same time, Trump has launched a far-reaching attack on renewable energy, with wind power hit the hardest. Offshore wind developers have been forced into court to defend projects, including an almost complete offshore wind farm. Since offshore wind turbines are sited in federal waters, the industry is especially vulnerable to Trump’s sabotage. The industry has long been the subject of a far-right think tank-backed anti-wind disinformation campaign.

Beyond the revolving door of corporate nominees and appointees, the report details numerous examples of Trump administration hires serving in, or nominated for, high positions with little, if any, subject matter expertise. Many have political connections, experience in other fields, or backgrounds in marketing, public relations and public speaking.

30%: Trump Fails To Kill NEVI Funding, Speeds It Up Instead

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Longtime readers of this publication and industry pros probably know the acronym NEVI: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the program allocated $5 billion in funding for DC fast chargers for states to dole out in the form of grant money. As part of its anti-green energy and cost-cutting push, the Trump administration sought to cancel that funding, but a federal court overruled that move in July.

Since then, Politico reports, more than 40 states are in the process of unlocking their NEVI funding—and red states like Texas and Montana lead the way. At least 32 say they have gotten a green light. And Trump's Department of Transportation actually seems to be offering more flexibility on where these chargers can be placed.

The publication calls this ""a major acceleration."" More on why, with emphasis mine below:

The new guidance that DOT issued in August largely kept the Biden administration’s rules but ditched a contentious requirement that chargers be placed every 50 miles along major highways. It also directed states to quickly submit updated implementation plans to access the funds. In the weeks since, at least 44 states and Washington, D.C., have submitted their plans, spokespeople for those states told POLITICO.

In a statement Friday, DOT spokesperson Nathaniel Sizemore said the Biden administration had added requirements to NEVI that were “difficult to understand and implement,” and that the huge amount of money that remained unobligated when the former president left office was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”

“Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient,” Sizemore said. “If a [state’s] submitted plan meets the requirements detailed in the updated program guidance, it will be approved and the State’s NEVI funding will be made available for obligation.”

State and industry officials said the rush to access the money was due to both pent-up enthusiasm for the charger cash and a positive reception to the flexibility offered under the new rules.

“We’re already seeing states reengage and move more quickly toward accessing funds,” said David Piperno, chief financial officer at SparkCharge, an EV fleet charging provider. “The overall tone has shifted and there’s a new urgency to put these dollars to work.”

One transportation official told Politico that the strategic placement of chargers in America is about to get better, and at more gas stations and existing stops, because there's no longer this arbitrary 50-mile requirement. That was often very difficult to implement in, say, places like Alaska, which might have 80-mile stretches of rural highway with no communities along the way.

So, to recap: Trump tried to cancel EV charger funding, failed, declined to appeal in court, and has somehow put new rules in place that may actually be cutting red tape around deployment. What a time to be alive.

More from that story:

But it also reflects a growing reality: Millions of EVs are expected to hit the road in the coming years, regardless of Trump’s policies. And their drivers are going to need places to charge.

“If you look at the states that are putting their [charging] plans and their money back into play the soonest, it’s really states that recognize their EV adoption rate is going to continue to climb,” said Joshua Rodriguez, program director for environment at the nonpartisan American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Red or blue or purple, it doesn’t really matter.”

It's a good sign that, tax credits or no, you can't stop progress.

60%: Stellantis' U.S. Brands Could Get A Big Capital Boost

2025 Jeep Wagoneer S Limited

One major criticism of Stellantis’ former CEO is that he steered capital and R&D investments toward the wrong brands within the European-American conglomerate. American brands like Jeep and Ram make much of Stellantis' revenue, yet they've been dealing with overpriced and aging lineups for years. (I am not saying this magically would've prevented those brands from making lackluster EVs, but it certainly didn't help.)

According to a new report, that could change soon. Bloomberg indicates Stellantis' American brands are about to get a major boost:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants—for re-openings, hiring and new models—in states including Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

[...] The new CEO has started scrapping some European investments, withdrawing support from a joint hydrogen fuel cell venture with Michelin and Forvia SE. Stellantis also is mulling a sale of its Free2move car-sharing business, Bloomberg reported this week. Earlier this year, the automaker hired McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice on Maserati and Alfa Romeo. It has repeatedly denied any plans to sell Maserati.

This U.S. focus makes sense for several reasons. For one, it's Stellantis going where the money is; its sales are lagging in Europe, and it faces severe factory overcapacity there too. And Jeep, Ram and even Dodge are what pay a lot of the bills. Plus, the American investments are necessary at a time when the company is getting hammered by Trump tariffs.

With any luck, this will also mean better U.S. investments into, at the very least, hybrid powertrains. Stellantis can't bet on V8 engines to win the future.

90%: Elon Musk's Turnover Problem

You can't really disrupt an industry the way Tesla did without busting your ass. But one problem within the company is that it still runs at the pace of an early-stage startup, and this has led to rapid-fire turnover that's somehow accelerated in recent years.

The Financial Times (subscription required) has the scoop on the burnout factor at Tesla, which is now endemic to Musk's other companies too:

Important members of Tesla’s US sales team, battery and power-train operations, public affairs arm, and its chief information officer have all recently departed, as well as core members of the Optimus robot and artificial intelligence teams on which Musk has bet the future of the company.

While many left happily after long service to found start-ups or take career breaks, there has also been an uptick in those quitting from burnout, or disillusionment with Musk’s strategic pivots, mass lay-offs and his politics, the people said.

“The one constant in Elon’s world is how quickly he burns through deputies,” said one of the billionaire’s advisers. “Even the board jokes, there’s time and then there’s ‘Tesla time’. It’s a 24/7 campaign-style work ethos. Not everyone is cut out for that.”

Robert Keele, xAI’s general counsel, ended his 16-month tenure in early August by posting an AI-generated video of a suited lawyer screaming while shovelling molten coal. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough,” he commented.

It's certainly not news that working for Musk can be brutal. But this situation is also intertwined with Tesla's apparent pivot away from building newer and cheaper EVs, and more to the unproven spaces of robotics and AI, the story notes:

Tesla has traditionally been the most stable part of Musk’s conglomerate. But many of the top team left after it culled 14,000 jobs in April 2024. Some departures were triggered as Musk moved investment away from new electric vehicle and battery projects that many employees saw as key to its mission of reducing global emissions—and prioritised robotics, AI and self-driving robotaxis.

Employees also perceive Musk’s rivalry with [Sam] Altman—with whom he co-founded OpenAI, before they fell out — to be behind the pressure being put on staff.

“Elon’s got a chip on his shoulder from ChatGPT and is spending every waking moment trying to put Sam out of business,” said one recent top departee.

I suppose we'll see what this era of Tesla is really capable of with tomorrow's reveal of the allegedly cheaper Model Y variant.

A 2023 U.S. Department of Energy report found that Puerto Rico had more than enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity needs.","Conservation and community groups have won a legal challenge to federal plans to spend billions of dollars to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electric grid back to the centralized, fossil fuel-dependent status quo instead of investing post-disaster funding in distributed renewable energy.

Thursday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico holds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it failed to consider rooftop solar, storage and other forms of distributed renewable energy to provide electricity to communities at risk from Puerto Rico’s hurricane-battered grid. The ruling orders FEMA to prepare an environmental impact statement that analyzes distributed renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.

The new ruling found that “[m]ost Puerto Ricans depend on an electrical power infrastructure that relies primarily on fossil fuels,” which the court concluded “has proven inadequate, unreliable and extremely vulnerable to weather events, events whose effects will be more severe in the future due to climate change.”

The ruling goes on to find that “if FEMA funding continues to be channeled to fossil fuel-based infrastructure, it is unlikely that Puerto Rico will have the resources to pursue renewable energy alternatives in the near future,” explaining how “the record clearly shows that renewable energy alternatives were reasonable and feasible.”

”This decision shatters the misconception that there is only one way to transform the electrical system and, on the contrary, recognizes that the alternative we have promoted for years — a renewable, distributed system — is viable and should be seriously considered when allocating public funds,” said Federico Cintrón Moscoso, program director of El Puente de Williamsburg’s Latino Climate Action Network in Puerto Rico. “FEMA’s failure to consider the solar alternative violated the law and paved the way for the reconstruction of the same obsolete fossil-based system that brought us to this crisis in the first place. This decision, therefore, recognizes our right to an accessible and clean energy system, as stipulated by our local laws and collective aspirations. It also recognizes that we cannot aspire to transform our electrical system at the expense of our health and that of the environment. Energy issues must be addressed fairly because they are not separate from the well-being of people or the planet.”

The ruling comes after Hurricane Erin impacted the archipelago in August 2025 and left thousands of Puerto Ricans without power yet again. Earlier this year, chronic grid outages compelled Puerto Rico’s governor to pledge to improve the fossil fuel grid. This case involves funds that Congress already allocated to Puerto Rico in Hurricane Maria’s aftermath.

This case concerns FEMA’s use of disaster relief funds from 2017’s Hurricane Maria to invest at least $12 billion in projects that lock Puerto Ricans into decades of fossil-fuel dependence. FEMA’s projects conflict with Puerto Rico’s 2019 law setting a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050 and Puerto Ricans’ own energy plan for local solar and storage. A 2023 U.S. Department of Energy report found that Puerto Rico had more than enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity needs.

The lawsuit was brought by the Center for Biological Diversity and eight Puerto Rican community groups: Alianza Comunitaria Ambiental del Sureste, Campamento Contra las Cenizas en Peñuelas, Casa Tallaboeña de Formación Comunitaria y Resiliencia, Comité Caborrojeño Pro Salud y Ambiente, Comité Dialogo Ambiental, Comité Yabucoeno Pro-Calidad de Vida, El Puente de Williamsburg and Frente Unido Pro-Defensa del Valle de Lajas.

A Circular Future Critical minerals are essential to everyday life and the clean energy transition.
In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals.","Key Takeaways:

The United States remains heavily dependent on imports for the critical minerals essential to the clean energy transition and everyday technologies.

Circular economy strategies help bolster the domestic supply chain by reducing reliance on virgin materials and imports.

Recycling and secondary recovery methods tap into discarded products and waste products to recover critical minerals and put them back in circulation.

Critical minerals are embedded in the fabric of everyday life, from energy, communications, and consumer electronics to transportation and healthcare. These minerals are also the foundation of the clean energy transition. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel are key inputs for the advanced batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage. Neodymium and dysprosium are essential for the permanent magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines. Tellurium and cadmium can be found in solar panels, while aluminum is a crucial component of modern transmission lines. Even next-generation fuels like renewable hydrogen rely on platinum, nickel, or iridium.

The U.S. Depends on China and Others for Its Critical Minerals

The United States produces 37 of the 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S. Geological Survey from mining, secondary recovery, or recycling. However, it lacks a strong domestic supply chain, making the country heavily dependent on imports for most of its mineral needs. In 2024, the United States relied on imports for 100% of 12 critical minerals, and for more than 50% of another 28 minerals. China dominates global supply chains, being the top producer of 60% of U.S.-designated critical minerals. China is also the leading source of U.S. imports for nine of the 13 minerals for which the United States is most import-reliant. The United States also relies on Canada, Japan, and South Africa for critical minerals.

As this reliance suggests, a small fraction of countries produce the bulk of global critical mineral supplies. This fact—combined with long timelines for U.S. mining projects, mineral price volatility, and geopolitical conflict—has left the country vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Finding alternative, domestic sources of critical minerals can reduce vulnerability to these disruptions while supporting the clean energy transition.

The Circular Economy Approach

One strategy to reduce dependence is to adopt a more circular economy. As opposed to the traditional “take-make-waste” linear model, circular economies emerge when companies reduce material use, redesign products to require fewer inputs, and capture waste as a resource for new production. This approach improves resource efficiency, reduces waste, eases pressure on ecosystems, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. It also presents opportunities for new markets and job creation by expanding recovery and remanufacturing industries, and by favoring new business models like product leasing and product-as-a-service.

Improving resource efficiency and exploiting domestic sources is particularly important for critical minerals. As demand for clean energy and other critical mineral-reliant technologies increases, the need for minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is expected to rise. Circular strategies like recycling and secondary recovery can help meet this increased demand through domestic supply, without resorting to mining and its accompanying environmental damage. Reconfiguring the country’s critical mineral supply chain to prioritize circularity could bolster sustainability efforts and build toward a more secure energy future.

Closing the Loop: Battery Recycling

Recycling is one of the most important strategies for securing access to critical minerals. Mineral recycling can help reduce import reliance, decrease waste, and limit the environmental impacts of mining and waste disposal. Indeed, as more products containing critical minerals reach the end of their lives, they end up in landfills, potentially harming the environment and disproportionately impacting low-income and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities.

Lithium-ion battery recycling, particularly of EV batteries, presents significant opportunities. Battery recycling could reduce demand for mined lithium, nickel, and cobalt by around 10%. Despite this potential, fewer than 15% of U.S. lithium-ion batteries are recycled due to inefficient and inconsistent collection systems and limited recycling infrastructure.

Currently, most critical mineral recycling takes place through pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, batteries are smelted at high temperatures to recover metals, whereas in hydrometallurgy, acids are used to leach minerals from the battery’s cathodes, where the critical minerals are found. While both methods are effective, they are also costly and resource-intensive.

However, new techniques are beginning to improve the affordability and sustainability of mineral recycling. Researchers are developing two processes, organic acid extraction and deep eutectic solvents, which increase the efficiency and decrease the environmental impacts of hydrometallurgy. Another more widely adopted innovation is direct recycling, also known as “cathode to cathode” recycling, which restores cathode materials for immediate reuse rather than breaking them down into their base metals.

Battery design is a critical factor in overall recyclability. Complex disassembly is a major obstacle to scaling up recycling. Currently, many EV batteries are built with screws and welds that make dismantling them difficult and time-intensive. To address this challenge, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are experimenting with a new Quick-ReleaseTM Binder that could replace conventional fasteners, enabling more cost-effective and efficient disassembly. Designing batteries for recyclability from the start ensures that mineral recovery is viable.

While recycling alone cannot fulfill U.S. demand for critical minerals, it is crucial to securing a domestic supply chain. By recapturing minerals that would otherwise end up in landfills and returning them to circulation, the United States can bolster its supply chain while protecting vulnerable communities.

Secondary Recovery

While recycling focuses on products already in circulation, secondary recovery targets byproducts, or “tailings”, of critical mineral production, processing, and manufacturing. Historically, this waste has been underutilized due to its environmental and health hazards, but when treated properly, it can be transformed into new, domestic sources of critical minerals.

Acid Mine Drainage

On federal land alone, there are 140,000 abandoned mine features, costing the federal government $287 million in annual remediation. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most significant issues associated with abandoned mines, contaminating 12,400 miles of streams and rivers in the United States. When mines are abandoned, they leave behind pits that collect rainwater. This water reacts with sulfide minerals from exposed rocks and oxygen to form sulfuric acid, which in turn dissolves heavy metals from the rocks into the water. Once the pit reaches its maximum level, it overflows into the surrounding watershed, contaminating the environment. Contaminated AMD water also contains critical minerals.

New treatment methods can simultaneously clean the water while capturing these minerals. For example, a two-step process developed at Pennsylvania State University adds carbon dioxide to AMD to create solids containing critical minerals that can be separated from the water. In Appalachia, solids collected from AMD treatment have been found to contain over 2,000 milligrams of rare earth elements per kilogram of material, valued at up to $400 per metric ton. The study of a pilot recovery plant by the University of West Virginia confirmed that recovery can be both technically feasible and economically viable at scale, with positive returns and payback within a few years. These high yields have been confirmed for AMD from coal and hard-rock mines, indicating that AMD recovery is applicable to many abandoned mines across the United States.

Phosphate Fertilizer Waste

Another promising opportunity for critical mineral secondary recovery comes from the fertilizer industry. Producing phosphate fertilizer generates large volumes of phosphogypsum waste—about 5 tons for every ton of phosphate produced. This radioactive waste, typically stored in large piles at hazardous waste sites, has high concentrations of critical minerals.

While more experimental than AMD recovery, chemical extraction methods for fertilizer waste have successfully extracted 77–94% of rare earth elements (REEs), a subset of critical minerals, from phosphogypsum. More recent research on biological methods of extraction has found that bio-acids can leach REEs at a milder acidity than mineral acids, reducing potential environmental impacts. A concentration of only 4% of REEs in phosphogypsum is required for recovery. Adding special polymers to the fertilizer waste can further concentrate REEs, increasing the ease of extraction.

Researchers are now looking to bring these methods to scale and increase yields. Experts emphasize that recovery becomes most viable when extraction facilities are co-located with existing phosphate operations, where the waste is already being collected and handled. Co-location reduces transportation and infrastructure costs, allowing recovery systems to leverage the fertilizer industry's existing footprint.

A Circular Future

Critical minerals are essential to everyday life and the clean energy transition. Worryingly, the United States remains heavily reliant on imports for most of its supply. Circular economic strategies, particularly recycling and secondary recovery, offer practical ways to reduce dependence while simultaneously bolstering economic and environmental opportunities.

In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals. The Department of Energy responded with nearly $1 billion in new funding for battery recycling, expanded recovery from mining and metal byproducts, and rare earth recovery and refinement demonstration projects. Congress has shown bipartisan support as well, through the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025 (H.R.2444/S.257) and the Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act (H.R.3198/S.823).

Even with this growing activity, additional federal support is still needed, including long-term support for recycling infrastructure, expansion of nationwide secondary recovery facilities, and clearer standards for integrating circular economy principles into supply chain planning.",,N,,2025-10-06 11:04:54.553486

“Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs.” Advocacy groups also warned of wide-ranging fallout.
“By canceling more renewable energy projects, Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans,” said Patrick Drupp, Climate Policy Director at the Sierra Club.

The move has triggered a wave of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and energy advocates, who say the decision amounts to political punishment with consequences for jobs, innovation, and consumer energy costs.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency said in a statement.

A full list of affected projects has not yet been made public. However, DOE confirmed award recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, and some have already begun that process.

The cancellations cut across a wide range of DOE programs, including the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and Fossil Energy. In total, 321 financial awards were terminated. DOE officials highlighted that 26% of the awards — worth more than $3.1 billion — were issued in the short window between Election Day and the presidential inauguration, calling them hastily approved and inadequately documented.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the decision, saying DOE has been working to review “billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, echoed support in a post on X, saying the awards in states such as California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, and Washington were part of “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

But Democratic leaders see the move differently. They argue it undermines the rule of law and weaponizes federal policy for partisan purposes.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

“Our democracy is badly broken when a president can illegally suspend projects for Blue states in order to punish his political enemies,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., called the cancellations “reckless” and a betrayal of the public trust. “Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs.”

Advocacy groups also warned of wide-ranging fallout. Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said ending the awards would “stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Canceled awards reportedly include hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, battery production facilities, grid modernization efforts, clean vehicle manufacturing, and industrial decarbonization projects. California officials confirmed DOE rescinded up to $1.2 billion earmarked for ARCHES — the state’s planned hydrogen hub.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also denounced the move, saying it would undercut U.S. leadership in renewable energy.

Environmental groups stressed that consumers ultimately will bear the brunt. “By canceling more renewable energy projects, Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans,” said Patrick Drupp, Climate Policy Director at the Sierra Club.

With $7.6 billion in funding now rescinded, energy experts say the decision could slow progress toward decarbonization, stall advanced technology deployment, and diminish private sector confidence in federal clean energy initiatives. Supporters of the canceled projects warn that the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge to Europe and Asia, where governments are aggressively investing in clean energy manufacturing and innovation.",,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:48.905743

To help close this funding gap, Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P) launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2023, created GIP to finance and de-risk climate projects in the region.

GIP is an innovative blended finance vehicle under FAST-P that has secured $510 million in committed capital from global and regional private, public and philanthropic institutions. It will fund projects in sectors critical to decarbonisation and sustainable growth including renewable energy, distributed generation, e-mobility, circular economy and emerging climate solutions. GIP begins investing this year, starting with a bio-energy programme through BECIS Bioenergy that converts agricultural waste and other sustainably sourced feedstock into renewable steam, reducing over 100,000 tonnes of emissions annually. Also, a renewables portfolio with ib vogt comprising utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, cutting an estimated 257,000 tonnes of emissions each year.

BII’s $60 million commitment, including $10 million from its £100 million mobilisation facility announced by the UK Prime Minister at the UN General Assembly in 2024, has played a critical role in achieving the fund’s first close. It has helped to de-risk the capital structure to attract further commercial capital.

Congressman Gabe Vasquez: Sure.
KC Counts: Congressman Gabe Vasquez, thank you very much for your time.
Congressman Gabe Vasquez: Thank you so much.","The Department of Energy announced billions in cuts to green energy projects in blue states. U.S. Congressman Gabe Vasquez talks with KC Counts about how New Mexico is affected. Here is a transcript of their conversation:

KC Counts:

Tell us what the landscape looks like in terms of how these cuts will impact New Mexico.

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

So, because of this political retribution and this decision to cut Department of Energy projects across the nation, New Mexico stands to lose over $135 million in investment for energy production, energy research, and that includes $56 million right here in New Mexico's second district. All four of the projects that were defunded in my district would be housed at New Mexico Tech inSocorro. Now, by cutting these projects, the administration has really hamstrung the ability for us to modernize fossil fuel development and oil and gas development in places like the Four Corners and the Permian Basin. The purpose of these funds were to develop, you know, methane capture technology that would make oil and gas production cleaner, avoid the types of methane leaks that we've seen. We have one of the largest methane clouds in the world right here in the Permian Basin. So, this means that we're going to lose out on research projects, jobs, students are going to miss out on this opportunity. And not just that, but the most important thing is that having cleaner oil and gas development contributes to cleaner air for all New Mexicans. And that's one of the things that we absolutely need, especially in communities like Hobbs and Carlsbad right here in my district, but also areas like Farmington and Gallup up north. So, it really impedes our ability to move forward with that technology and that includes retrofitting existing oil and gas wells. So, we're not moving in the right direction. And those folks at New Mexico Tech deserve to continue with this important research that's going to benefit all New Mexicans and the companies as well.

KC Counts:

In what way is this particular funding being affected? Was it yet to be distributed?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

So, this funding was yet to be distributed. Here at New Mexico Tech, that $56 million was congressionally approved funding. That means Congress allocated that funding by a vote in Congress. It's now been rescinded by Secretary Wright of the Department of Energy. The projects across the country are different. There are some projects that were already underway that are being cut halfway through their grants or through their projects. There's other projects that were just about to start, and if you think about what it takes for a university like New Mexico Tech to put the resources in place just to conduct and deliver on this grant, they have to mobilize an immense amount of resources, not to mention the amount of time that it took to actually apply for these funds. So, there's already money being lost. There's potential jobs being lost with contractors who are going to work as part of this project. So, it varies project by project across the country U.S. Congressman Gabe, but in this case, we stand to lose all $56 million of that congressionally approved funding for New Mexico Tech, although New Mexico Tech has already prepared themselves to take on this research.

KC Counts:

At this point, Congressman Vasquez, what is the remedy?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

Well, just today I sent a letter to Secretary Wright outlining how important these projects are across the country. One, because they help to lower the utility bills for all Americans. When we can create safer, cleaner, renewable energy or safer and cleaner fossil fuel energy, it helps both the companies and it helps New Mexicans, because if you think about methane leaks and capturing those methane leaks, those oil and gas companies actually make money off of selling some of that natural gas and some of the byproducts back to New Mexico, in the form of royalties, and that's really important. So, we're actually standing to lose millions more from not implementing this type of technology. Our air is going to get dirtier. You know, those high rates of respiratory disease in places like the Permian Basin are going to continue to climb. So that's just, it's not a good thing for us. But in terms of how we fix it, Secretary Wright has the opportunity to turn the dial back on this. Unfortunately, because of this political retribution, the fact that these projects were pulled in 12 blue states and the fact that this is a vindictive action by the administration, I'm not sure how willing they're going to be to restore that funding. But in my view, it also is a violation of the impoundment clause, which this administration has completely ignored in the last eight months.

KC Counts:

Looking ahead, do you think that there is a longer-term fix? Obviously, There's been a lot of political maneuvering in states like Texas to redraw boundaries, get more Republican seats. So, what is your outlook, quickly, before I let you go, Congressman Vasquez, on the midterms?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

Sure. Well, look, when Democrats have the majority in the House, we're going to work on a package of legislation that protects the American people from any future actions, from any future administration, from violating the impoundment clause, making clear that it is a violation of the law to misuse or misappropriate or retract congressionally directed spending. There's three branches of government for a reason. The Democratic Party believes strongly in those foundations that our founding fathers laid before us. And even though some may want to abdicate that responsibility or give that responsibility to the administration, I refuse to render Congress powerless. Folks elect us for a reason. They expect us to pass a yearly budget, which we haven't done. They expect that those congressionally directed funds are going to be spent in the way that they're supposed to be spent. And we've got to make sure that no president, Democrat or Republican, can do this in the future.

KC Counts:

Created in 1948, the IUCN comprises the world’s largest and most diverse network of organizations working for the environment. From governments to non-profits and more, over 1,400 member organizations and 17,000 experts make up the union of the IUCN—the “global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it.”

The Aquarium was recognized as a member because of its commitment to conservation and the IUCN mission, demonstrated through our extensive animal care, innovative scientific research, and marine conservation and education work. While the IUCN strives to conserve all of nature, our ocean-specific focus lets us weigh in on issues ranging from marine life and habitats to the blue economy and youth engagement—and connects the Aquarium to a broad array of experts and resources to help advance our own work to protect the blue planet.

While it’s still the early days of the membership, there are opportunities to be more involved in the future. One area is in informing equitable and effective practices for the IUCN’s project-based conservation work around the globe, based on our experience working with and learning from our Marine Conservation Action Fund (MCAF) fellows and project leaders.

Another is for members of our Animal Care and Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life teams to serve on the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC)—groups of volunteer experts who gather knowledge on the status of over 150,000 different species and threats to them.

The SSC network, composed of more than 180 Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Conservation Committees, and Task Forces, “provides scientific advice to conservation organizations, government agencies, and other IUCN members,” and helps support international environmental agreements to protect biodiversity.

Already, Dr. Elizabeth Burgess, senior scientist in the Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, is a member of the SSC Sirenia Specialist Group. Veterinarian and Senior Scientist Dr. Charles Innis participates in the SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group.

The Aquarium is also exploring joining one of several other Commissions, such as the Commission on Education and Communications or the World Commission on Protected Areas.

In mid-October, a delegation from the Aquarium will be traveling to Abu Dhabi to attend the IUCN World Conservation Congress, a gathering held once every four years that brings together experts and decision-makers from around the globe. Chief of Conservation and Stewardship Dr. Letise LaFeir will represent the Aquarium as Authorized Vote Holder at the conference, joining debate at the Member’s Assembly and voting on IUCN conservation priorities on behalf of the Aquarium.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a Social Democrat who is also the vice chancellor, told the news agency.
The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.
“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” DPA quoted Klingbeil as saying.
“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ.","Germany’s ruling coalition confirmed it will extend a tax exemption for new electric vehicles as part of a broader effort to support the nation’s key car industry in the transition to more climate-friendly technologies.

Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will present a draft law soon that will keep the existing tax exemption for EVs in place until 2035, Maximilian Kall, a finance ministry spokesman, said Monday at a regular government news conference in Berlin, confirming a report by DPA.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a Social Democrat who is also the vice chancellor, told the news agency.

The coalition accord agreed on by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and Klingbeil’s SPD included the pledge to extend the incentive to 2035 and the confirmation comes ahead of a planned “car summit” Thursday between government officials, auto executives and labor representatives.

The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.

Announcements last month that Volkswagen AG was paring back production and Robert Bosch GmbH slashing 13,000 jobs were the latest evidence of how the auto industry’s decline is rippling through Europe’s biggest economy.

Auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG followed last week by saying it planned to eliminate 7,600 positions at its electrified drivetrain division as it steps up its restructuring efforts to deal with poor demand.

“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” DPA quoted Klingbeil as saying. “We want the best cars to continue to be made in Germany.”

Extending the EV exemption is expected to cost the federal government approximately €600 million ($702 million) in lost revenue through 2029, Kall told reporters.

As part of his government’s effort to aid the car sector, Merz last month urged the European Union to give up its 2035 deadline to effectively ban combustion engines and instead allow the industry to pursue a softer path to climate neutrality.

Some members of Klingbeil’s SPD are unhappy with the move, but the party is expected to signal its backing this week, with the issue set to be discussed at regular coalition talks on Wednesday in Berlin.

Olaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony whose government is VW’s second-biggest shareholder, said last week the priority should be to protect jobs.

“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ. “Combustion engines, especially plug-in hybrids and vehicles with range extenders, must continue to be permitted beyond 2035, and alternative fuels must also be included.”

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

""Home energy storage is no longer a luxury—it's becoming the backbone of the modern renewable home,"" notes an energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Renewables Integration and the Rise of Energy Independence

Homeowners across the world are rethinking how they consume and store energy. With increasing electricity demand and growing solar installations, energy storage is bridging the gap between generation and reliability.

Residential users can now store excess solar energy generated during the day and deploy it when sunlight fades or during grid outages. This not only enhances energy security but also significantly reduces electricity costs, creating a compelling economic case for adoption.

In markets like California, Germany, and Australia, government incentives and tax credits have accelerated residential storage installations. For instance, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers a 30% federal tax credit, while Australia provides rebates up to A$1,300 under new state energy programs.

Battery Technology: From Lithium-Ion Dominance to Sodium-Ion Disruption

In 2024, lithium-ion batteries held roughly 70% of the global market share, thanks to their high energy density, efficiency, and long lifecycle. However, the market is undergoing a technological transition.

Emerging sodium-ion batteries are attracting attention as a lower-cost, safer, and more sustainable alternative. They rely less on critical minerals like lithium and cobalt and perform effectively across wider temperature ranges. This makes them especially suited for frequent charge-discharge cycles—a hallmark of residential energy systems connected to intermittent renewables like solar.

""Sodium-ion chemistry could become the defining innovation of the next decade,"" predicts a senior researcher at BloombergNEF, ""particularly as cost reduction aligns with scaling solar-plus-storage projects.""

At the same time, the race toward solid-state batteries promises even greater safety, energy density, and durability, further lowering the total cost of ownership for homeowners.

AI and Smart Energy Management

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining how home energy storage systems operate. Advanced AI algorithms are enabling dynamic energy forecasting, real-time optimization, and predictive maintenance.

Smart energy management systems now predict renewable generation patterns and optimize when to buy, store, or release energy based on grid prices. This capability transforms a household battery from a passive storage unit into an intelligent energy trading asset.

AI also plays a crucial role in battery health diagnostics, extending lifespan through adaptive charging strategies and preemptive fault detection.

This integration of digital intelligence is paving the way for Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) decentralized energy networks that aggregate home batteries into grid-level assets. VPPs enhance grid stability, unlock new revenue streams for homeowners, and support the broader decarbonization of energy systems.

Market Segmentation: Powering Homes of All Sizes

By Capacity: The 10-20 kWh segment leads the market with a 40% share, as it aligns with typical residential backup needs and peak load management. However, >20 kWh systems are expected to grow fastest as costs decline and demand for long-duration backup rises.

By Connectivity: On-grid systems dominate with 60% share, while hybrid systems—which combine grid, solar, and battery backup—are expected to see the most significant growth through 2034.

By End User: Single-family homes remain the largest segment (55% share), driven by rooftop solar adoption. Meanwhile, multi-family housing is emerging as a fast-growing segment, especially in dense urban areas where shared energy systems are being tested.

Regional Outlook: Global Hotspots of Growth

North America

The U.S. market alone was valued at USD 0.96 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to USD 2.40 billion by 2034. Federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and state-level programs such as California's SGIP continue to propel adoption.

Grid modernization projects and frequent climate-induced outages further strengthen demand for resilient residential systems.

Europe

Germany remains the European leader, supported by KfW loans, net-metering incentives, and strict technical standards for battery integration. The U.K. has reinforced growth with VAT exemptions for home battery systems and the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), rewarding users for exporting stored energy.

Asia-Pacific

Expected to grow at the fastest CAGR through 2034, the region's expansion is anchored by China's 30 GW energy storage target by 2025 and India's ₹5,400 crore viability gap funding (VGF) for new BESS projects. Japan's GX Transition Bonds and aggressive decarbonization initiatives further underline Asia's pivotal role in shaping global energy storage trends.

Investment and Industry Momentum

Private equity and utility companies are investing heavily in home storage technologies. Giants like Tesla (Powerwall 3), LG Energy Solution (enblock S+), and BYD (Battery-Box HVB) are joined by emerging European innovators such as Sonnen and software-driven platforms like Enphase Energy.

Investors are particularly attracted by the dual value proposition: growing consumer demand for energy independence and the opportunity to participate in decentralized grid stabilization via VPPs.

Toward a Smarter, Decentralized Future

As the world edges toward a decentralized, AI-enabled energy economy, home energy storage systems are set to become a mainstream household technology. The convergence of battery innovation, digital intelligence, and renewable generation is transforming how homeowners interact with energy—turning them from passive consumers into active participants in the energy ecosystem.

By 2034, the global market will not only double in value but also redefine what it means to be energy independent—where every home can generate, store, and manage its own clean power.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:05:25.391392

James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, attacked Sadiq Khan’s housing record as London mayor in his speech to the conference this afternoon.

Since 2010, Conservatives have delivered 2.5m homes – a million of those in the last parliament alone.

Last year in the south-east of England, and the east of England, Conservative-run regions, about 2.5 new homes were built per thousand people.

In London, run by Labour for the best part of a decade, 0.5 homes per thousand.

And so, what do those figures mean, for real people, for ordinary hard-working Londoners?

In 1980, the average London home cost £25,000, and that was about four times the average national salary.

Today, the average London house costs over £500,000.

And that is fifteen times the average salary.

That is Sadiq Khan’s record of failure.

We should not, and we cannot, and we must not accept it.

There is speculation that Cleverly may put himself forward as the Tory candidate for London mayor at the next election, in 2028.

Matt Chorley from the BBC has written an excellent long read on what Tory MPs are saying in private about Kemi Badenoch and her prospects. It includes this wonderful anecdote.

In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches.

When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied “oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in”.

John Glen, Badenoch's PPS, floats case for cutting pensions tax relief for high earners

Phillip Inman

Phillip Inman is a senior Guardian economics writer.

John Glen, Kemi Badenoch’s bag carrier (parliamentary private secretary), has raised the prospect of the Conservative party taking away pension subsidies from better off taxpayers.

Glen, who joked that his appointment in July as PPS had turned him into a slave, said there was a case to answer when the public finances were constrained and the level of pension subsidy had reached £50bn.

At a fringe meeting, Glen, who sits on the Commons Treasury committee, said:

We spend £40bn to £50bn on tax relief and £15bn to £20bn goes to people who pay the higher rates of tax. We need to have an honest discussion about what the overall burden of tax should be.

We have a system that is based on pension savings being exempt on entry and exempt on accumulation but taxed on exit. What we need to do is ask wha we can afford and what is fair.

It is not the party’s policy to have a single rate. There would obviously be an opportunity to change the rate.

But philosophically, the question is about the role of the state. There are lots of people receiving 40% relief and building penion pots that are much more than securing just a reasonable pot alongside their triple lock pension. The question is, are there better ways to spend that money?

Government pension subsidies are based on tax relief, which means those that pay the highest rates of tax gain the most from tax relief.

A flat rate subsidy of 25% or 30% would increase the subsidy for standard rate taxpayers while cutting it for those who pay higher rates of tax.

Ulster Unionist leader criticises Badenoch's proposal to leave ECHR

Lisa O’Carroll

Lisa O’Carroll is a senior Guardian correspondent.

The Ulster Unionist party has condemned Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch’s intention to leave the ECHR if she is voted into power.

The UUP helped negotiate Good Friday agreement peace deal which is undermined by the convention.

Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, said:

The Ulster Unionist party negotiated the 1998 agreement. Any suggestion of the UK leaving the ECHR, as suggested by Ms Badenoch, would cut across the principles of that agreement, which guarantees access to the ECHR in law, a point the Conservative leader has said herself would be a point of ‘particular challenge’.

Reform UK defends record of its Doge unit after report says cost-cutting won't stop Kent raising council tax

Reform UK has reject claims that its efforts to find savings in Kent council have been disappointing.

Referring to a story in the Financial Times today (see 7.59am), Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said:

Reform’s pledge to slash millions from Kent Council’s budget has turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Just like his idol Elon Musk, Zia Yusuf has spectacularly failed to deliver what Doge promised. It turns out cribbing the notes of dodgy American tech billionaires is no way to run a council.

But a Reform UK spokesperson insisted the party’s Dolge (Department of Local Government Efficiency) was having an impact. The spokesperson said:

Our team in Kent county council have already done some fantastic work to clean up the mess left by the Kent Conservatives and reduce the county council’s debt by £66m in their first five months in office. The majority of that has come from savings as a result of their Dolge unit.

This includes implementing a ‘no more borrowing’ policy which will reduce their debt by a further £33m by March 2026, scrapping KCC’s net zero renewable energy Programme to save £32m over 4 years and stopping the move to a new council building which has avoided an additional £14bn of borrowing.

Referring to reports that Kent is likely to raise council tax by 5%, the maximum amount, a Reform source argued that most councils were expected to do that and claimed that not raising council tax could lead to an authority losing government grant money.

Andrew Rosindell calls for pact with Reform UK, saying many Tories like him will lose their seats without one

The Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell has called for his party to form a pact with Reform UK to defeat Labour at the election.

In an interview with GB News, Rosindell said:

Our electoral system can’t accommodate two parties that are broadly conservative. That means a divide in the vote and the calamity of another Labour government for five years, or even worse, a Labour government propped up by Liberal Democrats, Greens, Plaid Cymru, SNP, fruit and nut, and whoever else is around to prop Keir Starmer up in office. No, thank you.

I would much rather see people of like mind on the right of centre to work together … We need to get everyone working together to rescue our country from the disaster of this left-wing socialist government.

Rosindell, who represents Romford, said, without a pact, many Tory MPs, including him, faced defeat at the election.

I’m worried about many of my colleagues who will not come back as MPs, including me. At the moment my seat would almost certainly go to Reform. I think the whole of Essex would go Reform.

Asked if he would stay with the Tories or defect to Reform before the electon, Rosindell said he wanted both parties “to think about what’s best for our country”.

At the Politico fringe, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, was asked by Dan Bloom the Theresa May question – what was the naughtiest thing he hads ever done? His answer was more interesting than hers.

Philp replied:

When I was a student at University at Oxford in the 1990s, OJ Simpson, remember him, came to speak at the Oxford Union, and he there was no press.

So I was very enterprising. I smuggled a load of recording equipment into the place, before the security cordon went up, recorded the entire thing, retrieved the recording devices afterwards, and then sold the recordings to various American news stations for a decent amount of money, in cash.

And I sold it simultaneously to ABC, NBC and CBS, all of whom thought they were getting it exclusively.

Former Tory Brexit secretary David Davis says he does not support ECHR withdrawal

Randeep Ramesh

Randeep Ramesh is the Guardian’s chief leader writer.

David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, has told a fringe meeting at the party conference that he is opposed to the party’s decision to leave the European convention on human rights.

Speaking to the Guardian, Davis, who is one of most prominent libertarians in the party, Davis said:

I don’t trust any British government – Conservative Labour, coalition – to have entirely clean hands on civil liberties, torture and rendition, surveillance, 90 days detention without charge, all these things. And parliament is getting weaker and weaker. So that’s why I want to have some external agency.

Davis said he was also concerned about the problems withdrawal from the ECHR would create in Northern Ireland.

It won’t destroy [the Belfast/Good Friday agreement] but it will cause issues and it will force a renegotiation with the Irish demanding things. On European trade policy, it would give the option to the Europeans of withdrawing certain aspects.

Davis also believes that that efforts being made by several European countries to reform the ECHR, including the Labour government in Britain, may lead to changes.

Philp plays down concerns proposed Tory removals force will adopt 'heavy-handed' tactics used by Trump's Ice

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has played down concerns that the Trump-style removals force proposed by the party will adopt some of the thuggish and lawless tactics used by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), its US counterpart.

Speaking at a fringe meeting at the conference, where he was being interviewed by Politico’s Dan Bloom, Philp said:

There are some examples in the US where they have clearly used tactics that are too heavy handed, and people families have been separated. We don’t advocate that sort of approach.

We do advocate zero tolerance for illegal immigration and anyone entering this country illegally, no matter what their purported excuse, will get removed within a week.

Philp told the same meeting there was another area where he would like to see the UK move closer to the US model. In the US there are thousands of government jobs which an incoming president can give to political appointees. In the UK the civil service in independent, and cabinet ministers are only allowed to bring in a handful of political appointee (special advisers, or “spads”) to help them. Philp said he would like to see this number increased.

I could imagine a few dozen people [as party political advisers] coming into a big department would make quite a big difference to ministers’ ability to get things done.

Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, suggests term 'disabled' being applied too widely if 25% of people qualify

Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, has suggested the term “disabled” is being over-used if it applies to around a quarter of people.

She made the claim in her speech in which she defended the Tory plan to cut benefits – which the party now says could save £23bn a year. (See 8.09am.)

She said:

We are here because we know we have a really important job to do – if not us, who?

But millions of people right now, are sitting on the sofa at home.

Millions have got themselves a sick note from the GP and signed onto sickness benefits with just a form and a phone call.

Millions are getting benefits for anxiety and ADHD, along with a free Motability car.

TikTok videos tell you how - and some people even pay for VIP services to boost their chances of a successful benefits claim.

Yes, there are people with serious illnesses and disabilities,

But one in four people now describe themselves as disabled, so what does the term even mean?

In claiming that the term disabled is used too widely, Whately is just echoing an argument made by Kemi Badenoch, who made a very similar comment earlier this year.

There is an explanation for the ‘one in four’ figure (24%, to be precise) in this DWP report. It is based on the definition of disabled in the Equality Act, which says a person is considered to have a disability if they have a physical or mental impairment that has ‘substantial’ and ‘long term’ negative effects on their ability to do normal daily activities.

In her speech, Whately also claimed she had a “common sense” plan to cut welfare spending.

I’ve got my common sense plan for savings.

Fix the ‘sick note’ system, bring back face-to-face assessments, end sickness benefits for low level mental health problems, stop the abuse of Motability, and put British citizens first in our benefits system – just living here is not a reason to get money from taxpayers.

And that’s not all.

We will change our sickness benefit system, so it helps those who really need help and stops turning people into victims.

We will make the benefits cap do what it should, so that families on benefits aren’t better off than those in work.

And we’ll tackle the massive hike in housing benefit.

All that gives you billions of savings off the benefits bill.

Helena Horton

Helena Horton is a Guardan environment reporter.

Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, has been accused of a Reform UK-style anti-business measure by experts.

She has pledged to scrap the the renewables obligation (RO) scheme, under which many wind farms receive fixed subsidies for 15–20 years. (See 11.27am.)

Coutinho referred to these subsidies as “the biggest racket going”, adding:

Our energy system is not here to prop up the profits of multi-million-pound wind developers at billpayers’ expense. It’s here to deliver cheap, reliable energy for the country.

However, one of the reasons the UK has historically been a favourable place to invest is its strong contract law, meaning that when a business signs a contract it knows the terms will be honoured.

Ripping up existing agreements would run contrary to this.

Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said:

If what is being proposed is to terminate contracts with renewable energy suppliers under the renewables obligation, unless there is an alternative in place, this kind of policy instability, akin to what Reform has proposed, would deter investors not just in renewables, but across the board from investing in the UK. This uncertainty would make financing more risky pushing up costs of investment, making everything in turn more expensive.

Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform, faced criticism from business leaders when he proposed a similar policy, to scrap the contracts for difference scheme under which renewables companies agree a price per megawatt hour for their power.

Even the wind power sceptic energy analyst Kathryn Porter, who writes for the Telegraph, has said that cancelling existing schemes would dent investor confidence.

New analysis has also found that renewables including wind power cut electricity prices by up to a quarter in the last year.

No 10 says claims government interference led to collapse of Chinese spying case 'all untrue'

Claims that government interference led to the collapse of a major Chinese spying case are “all untrue”, Downing Street has insisted. PA Media reports:

Ministers also retain confidence in England and Wales’ chief prosecutor following the case, according to No 10, as he based his work around the previous Conservative government’s policy on China.

The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry was dropped on 15 September, sparking criticism from Downing Street and MPs from across both sides of the political aisle.

The decision reportedly came after senior Whitehall mandarins met to discuss the trial, including national security adviser Jonathan Powell and the Foreign Office’s top civil servant Sir Oliver Robbins, according to the Sunday Times.

In order to prove the case under the Official Secrets Act, prosecutors would have had to show the defendants were acting for an “enemy”.

But Powell reportedly revealed the government’s evidence would be based on the national security strategy, which does not use that term to describe China, so it could not be used in court.

“The suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,” the PM’s press secretary told reporters at a lobby briefing this morning.

Among those who have heavily criticised the collapse of the case are the Tories, who have said ministers now have serious questions to answer.

But sources within government said evidence in the case had to relate to the period when the alleged incidents took place – between 2021 and 2023 – when the Conservatives were in power.

Senior Tory figures at the time – including the party’s current leader, Kemi Badenoch – did not refer to China as an enemy, only as a “challenge”, informing the evidence.

Stephen Parkinson, chief prosecutor in England and Wales, had said the CPS had determined the proceedings had to be stopped because of an “evidential failure”.

Downing Street was asked if the prime minister remained confident in Parkinson’s ability to do the job.

“Yes. It is obviously for the CPS to take decisions on the evidential threshold which they take cases forward, and they obviously judged that that threshold was met at the time,” a spokesperson said.

“It’s obviously up to them to keep that under review and to take their own decisions. But very clearly, the government’s evidence did not materially change, not least because it was based on the previous government’s policy, and previous governments’ policy can’t change.”

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

Unexpected benefits While increased housing values, visitor spending, and business activity may be fairly obvious economic benefits of parks, the Metroparks study also quantified some more unexpected and less tangible impacts.","This story is part of a series exploring how parks serve as engines of exploration, education, play, and equity. It is made possible with support from Huron-Clinton Metroparks and the City of Detroit.

Alicia Powell says she gets “choked up” every time she brings her food truck, Wetzel’s Pretzels, to vend at an event in one of Detroit’s newer parks. Powell, who often vends along the Joe Louis Greenway and at Spirit Plaza, says she doesn’t recall having “these beautiful greenspaces” when she was growing up in the city. Now, she says, she not only appreciates the new parks’ impact on her own business, but she feels like she’s “participating in this beautiful transformation” for the city overall.

“You have to have these greenspaces and recreational space for people,” she says. “… It makes these neighborhoods more attractive. And hopefully it brings value to the area, and then other people start investing more. But it starts with the city providing these spaces.”

Powell both exemplifies and summarizes several of the myriad economic benefits parks and greenspaces contribute to the communities surrounding them. Beyond simply providing a place for people to unwind in nature, parks also have demonstrable positive impacts on local businesses, property values, tourism, environmental management costs, and even medical bills.

“Parks offer an opportunity for maximizing investment in neighborhoods, so building or investing in a park really draws additional resources to that area, and we see that with the Joe Louis Greenway,” says Leona Medley, executive director of the Joe Louis Greenway Partnership. “It allows us to think about programming, … building on transportation networks, thinking about commercial corridor redevelopment, really focusing on neighborhood stabilization strategies, and preserving existing residents while also attracting new ones. And so we continue to see parks, as an economic development catalyst, produce good results around the city.”

Alexa Bush, the city of Detroit’s planning director, says parks “only add value to any of the other types of more traditional economic development activity.”

“I think having this opportunity to be in a really high-quality public space, a park, a natural area, adds to that value, and I think people recognize it even if they don’t name it as such,” she says. “… It only adds to the excitement, the density, the value of the vertical development that goes along with it.”

Attracting residents and visitors

One of the primary economic impacts of parks is their ability to attract both residents and visitors to the areas surrounding them. Amy McMillan, CEO of the Huron-Clinton Metroparks, says parks are “inseparable” from economic development – particularly in Michigan, where she says “quality of life” should be the “primary driver” of efforts to market the state as “an incredible place to live.”

“There have been studies for decades that demonstrate the influence that being next to well-maintained parkland and open space has on property values,” she says. “And so I think they’re inextricably linked, and that is not often enough realized when talking about economic development.”

Data back up McMillan’s assertions. A 2020 Journal of Leisure Research review of 33 studies found an average property value increase of 8-10% for properties adjacent to parks. And a 2020 study produced for the Metroparks by the Trust for Public Land found an additional $68 million in residential property value for properties within 500 feet of Metropark locations.

Similarly, parks are a boon to visitor attraction and visitor spending. The Metroparks study found that the parks system generates $92 million annually in visitor spending. Studies commissioned by the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy have found $82 million in annual visitor spending along the Detroit Riverfront, which has seen considerable revitalization over the past decade-plus.

Bush credits parks and greenspaces such as the Detroit Riverwalk and Campus Martius as major drivers of the revitalization of downtown Detroit.

“I think we’ve had that synergy between creating these really wonderful public places that work for big events [and] work for tourists, but they also support residential life downtown,” she says. “Those have all really, I think, served to reinforce one another.”

Business benefits

Parks also have significant positive implications for local business. For example, the Metroparks study found that the recreation economy in the Metroparks’ five-county service area supports 272 sporting goods stores generating $678 million in annual sales.

“People are buying bikes. They’re getting their bikes fixed. They’re buying golf clubs,” McMillan says.

Beyond the direct impact of park visitors buying supplies to support their recreational activities, parks can also be a catalyst for small, locally-owned businesses like Powell’s.

“It’s great for us – money in our pocket – and then it’s great for the residents,” Powell says.

Sandra Epps, owner of the Detroit-based face-and body-painting business Sandy’s Land, agrees. She says Joe Louis Greenway events have helped increase her business, with Tuesday yoga sessions on the greenway providing a particularly “huge boost.”

Epps says she was “excited” to learn that a section of the Joe Louis Greenway will be built near seven lots she’s acquired at the intersection of Fenkell Avenue and Log Cabin Street to build a butterfly garden and doll museum.

“New parks and greenspaces are creating a new resurgence in communities throughout Michigan, but especially in the city of Detroit,” she says. “And this is exciting to see and be a part of this new expansion and positive transition in the city of Detroit.”

Parks can draw new commercial activity to a neighborhood, which can require careful strategy to ensure that existing residents benefit from their new greenspace instead of being pushed out by it. Bush says the city of Detroit has been “highly intentional” about engaging Detroit business owners and community members in shaping the way new park investments affect their communities. One example of this is the 2025 Joe Louis Greenway Neighborhood Planning Study, which takes a highly granular neighborhood-level approach to planning investments in the communities surrounding the greenway.

The study was heavily shaped by community feedback. Medley says some neighborhood residents wanted to prioritize commercial corridor development around the greenway, while others did not. She and city staff have worked to be responsive to those needs.

“I think one of the most powerful strategies that we’re employing is … to ensure that we are understanding the current makeup of the neighborhoods, while also engaging with the residents to ask questions about what are some of the impacts that they want to see from a project like this, and then working … to really develop that strategy,” she says.

Unexpected benefits

While increased housing values, visitor spending, and business activity may be fairly obvious economic benefits of parks, the Metroparks study also quantified some more unexpected and less tangible impacts.

One of these is reduced health care bills. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for physical activity, The Trust for Public Land conducted a telephone survey to determine how many adults were using Metroparks “at a frequency and intensity that would result in health care cost savings.” The study found 9,030 adults ages 18-64, and 7,600 adults 65 and older, using the parks in this manner. Based on previous research into the health care savings associated with regular intense exercise, the Trust for Public Land assigned an average annual health care savings of $1,250 to the younger group and $2,500 to the elder, estimating the parks system’s total annual health benefit to users at $30.3 million.

“The opportunity to improve the health of our workforce, the impact that that has on the bottom line for companies, is not too often discussed,” McMillan says. “I think that is one of those opportunities that is hugely missed because we so often take it for granted.”

The Metroparks study also quantified the economic impact of the parks system’s environmental benefits. The many acres of pervious (i.e. non-paved) surfaces in each park hold significant benefit for absorbing stormwater, slowing its runoff, and filtering out pollutants. Calculating the total amount of stormwater runoff mitigated by the parks and multiplying it by the cost ($0.11 per cubic foot) of managing that water otherwise, the study found the Metroparks generate a $30.3 million annual savings in stormwater management alone. Similarly, the study found that the Metroparks remove 793,000 pounds of pollutants from the air annually, saving $2.25 million primarily in health care costs.

McMillan notes that, while the study was focused on the Metroparks, similar benefits will result from any park.

“They’re great for outdoor recreation when the weather’s good, and then they manage storm water when the weather is bad,” she says. “That presents a huge savings to local communities as a whole, and individual property owners that struggle with flooding.”

Given the many ways parks can positively impact the economies surrounding them, McMillan says it’s important not to become “complacent” about the natural resources around us. She notes that developing new parks and managing existing ones are “super intentional things” that “don’t happen by themselves.”

“It’s a virtuous cycle when you invest in public parks because it pays so many benefits to people individually, to the businesses, and we’re all the better for that,” she says.",https://djq2xymdufr22.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/05203607/IMG_FootTruck_20251002_Selections-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:08:01.577659

Waste to Energy Solutions convert waste products created in manufacturing, agriculture, wastewater treatment plants and other industries to electricity and BioChar.","IRVINE, CA., Oct. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company delivering complete lifecycle solutions & technologies in power generation, storage, waste-to-energy, and heat-to-power, announced today that its Clean Cycle II™ Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology has been deployed in Martin, Tennessee. The project, led by RPG Energy Group, was one of the most challenging — and rewarding — projects in its history: designing and delivering a waste heat recapture system using ORC technology for a Fortune 100 company. The project is one of the first of its kind in U.S. industrial manufacturing and sets a new benchmark for efficiency and corporate stewardship.

In today’s industrial landscape, corporations face relentless pressure to protect margins, reduce operating costs, and achieve environmental goals. One of the most overlooked threats to profitability is also one of the least visible: energy inefficiency. By bringing CETY’s technology to life in Martin, RPG proved that U.S. manufacturers can tackle these inefficiencies head-on and generate measurable returns.

Manufacturing plants release vast amounts of waste heat into the environment every day. For this Fortune 100 company , a recognized global leader in efficiency and sustainability, leaving that energy untapped was unacceptable. By working with CETY and RPG, they turned that liability into an opportunity — transforming waste heat into clean, usable electricity.

“The Martin project sets an example for industrial America. Waste heat recovery is complex, but it is achievable with the right partners, technology, and vision. RPG Energy Group is proud to have led this effort alongside CETY, paving the way for more projects that merge profitability, resilience, and sustainability,” said Jami Krynski, CEO of RPG.

“This installation demonstrates how industrial manufacturers can turn an untapped liability into a strategic advantage,” said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Our ORC solution not only reduces energy costs but also advances sustainability commitments — and it does so in a way that is replicable across industrial America.”

Partnership with RPG Energy Group

CETY partnered with RPG Energy Group to integrate the ORC system. RPG provided project development and integration support, guiding the process from feasibility through delivery. Together, the companies overcame the integration challenges that have historically slowed ORC adoption in the U.S.

“We value RPG’s role in bringing their expertise in development and integration,” Mahdi added. “This project reflects the strength of our combined efforts and the importance of collaboration in advancing clean energy solutions.”

The weeds are where it happens Klein and Thompson are clear that their book does not offer specific policy solutions.","In the introduction to their bestseller Abundance, authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson write that the book is “dedicated to a simple idea: to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. That’s it. That’s the thesis. It reads, even to us, as too simple.”

Klein and Thompson are right on both counts.

They are right that addressing the challenges of the climate crisis, affordable housing shortages, prohibitive healthcare costs, and stymied scientific innovation–all topics discussed in the book–will require ramped-up creativity, cooperation, funding, and planning. They are also right that their prescription for this need is too simple, at best.

The book focuses on the proper role and scope of government regulation, arguing that in many situations, government should simply get out of the way. Meanwhile, the warping, smothering influence of corporate money and power lurks on every page unacknowledged, like a monster Klein and Thompson refuse to see.

Scarcity is indeed a choice, as the authors say, but not one being made by overzealous regulators or litigators. Scarcity is a choice made by those who profit from imposing it on the rest of us. The problem is not chiefly a regulatory bottleneck–it is a boot on the neck of progress, competition, innovation, and millions of Americans who struggle to survive, by those enriched by the status quo. Abundance is a detailed indictment of the wrong suspect, which only serves the interests of the real culprits.

A book that hit a nerve

Abundance has garnered significant attention in political and policy circles and has spent more than six months on the New York Times bestseller list, and with good reason. Klein and Thompson are talented writers and the book includes earnest, trenchant observations.

At a time when progressives face constant assault for ineffectual messaging, Abundance feels like a lifeline, offering an alluring vision of a progressive future and identifying past liberal overreach as the barrier to achieving it. In that scenario, it is within liberals’ power to achieve the future “we all want.” Unfortunately, this apparent oasis is a dangerous mirage.

Rose-colored glasses

The original sin of Abundance is careless nostalgia. The book is premised on a rose-colored remembrance of a time when the United States “built things.”

To be sure, the United States has seen periods of explosive growth in manufacturing, housing, highways, and more–in part thanks to lower density, world wars, untapped resources, and undeveloped land. It is true that it only took about five years to erect Hoover Dam. It is also true that scores of workers died during construction.

The “golden ages” of US development came at the cost of lives, neighborhoods, air and water quality, biological diversity, and public health; these costs were largely paid by the poor and those living in Indigenous and front-line communities.

Klein and Thompson are self-described liberals and acknowledge the need for laws protecting the health and wellbeing of people and the environment, but it is difficult to reconcile that with their yearning for the good old days.

Any fair critique of our current regulatory system must begin with a clear-eyed assessment of the devastating, unsustainable, and unjust impacts on people and the planet wrought by oil companies, developers, mining companies, and highway builders before regulations were promulgated to govern them. Abundance fails to do so.

The elephant in the room

In addition to the authors’ averting their eyes from the realities of corporate money and power, they also write in a vacuum divorced from the current political reality.

There is no bill or Executive Order that could pass this Congress, or be signed by this President, to “cut red tape” that would be even remotely responsible. While Klein and Thompson offer their views on the need to speed permitting in good faith, the Trump Administration and the current Congress have already begun to adopt their talking points in the worst faith possible. Big Oil, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Developers have enormous sway over the agenda in Washington, and they are more than happy to glom on to abundance talking points to maintain wildly profitable scarcities.

Nothing demonstrates this more powerfully than repeal of significant portions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). While neither law was perfect, the IIJA included billions for new infrastructure development and the IRA included funding and tax incentives in support of sustainable electricity generation, clean transportation, green buildings and energy efficiency, sustainable manufacturing, environmental and climate justice, agriculture, forestry, land conservation, and more. In other words, Congress had enacted much of the abundance agenda.

And then, backed by millions from industry, the Trump Administration and the new Congress repealed virtually all of it (including provisions that were clearly benefiting red states) and replaced it with a budget bill designed to help old industries kill new ones. “Red tape” did not reach up and stymie a new age of abundance, wealthy special interests did, and any permitting “reform” passed now will only benefit those same old power players.

To focus on a utopian future where the biggest barrier to “the world we all want” is an inefficient regulatory process, while ignoring the stranglehold that monied interests have on American progress, fails to meet the moment.

The weeds are where it happens

Klein and Thompson are clear that their book does not offer specific policy solutions. Rather, they are offering a “lens” through which these issues might be examined. This feels inadequate. Permitting reform is not a new issue. Dozens of legislative proposals on the topic exist and the authors should reckon with them.

It turns out, every time lawmakers pushing permitting reform put pen to paper, the resulting legislation is the same: some combination of provisions that truncate public participation, limit judicial review, and privilege fossil fuel development even more. In many cases, the proponents of development are already benefiting from an approval process that skirts public awareness and effective judicial review, and they just want to write those shortcuts into law.

To give a recent example, last month the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted to “cut red tape” and approve three new Entergy gas plants to power a data center for Meta. From the beginning, the proceeding lacked transparency and skipped crucial state-mandated measures aimed at saving money for ratepayers. Review by an Administrative Law Judge of the final deal is typically part of the process, but Commissioners rushed a final vote before the judge could even issue a recommendation to the Commission.

A process that was even slightly less rushed would have allowed the judge to express an opinion about whether this proposal was truly in the “public interest” and allowed the Commissioners to attach bare-minimum safeguards for ratepayers as conditions of approval. Instead, regulators hurriedly granted the wishes of Entergy and Meta.

This is not the “future we all want.” This is abundance for Entergy and Meta’s shareholders at the expense of millions of Louisianans and the environment. If the “lens” described in Abundance can be used to justify this kind of irresponsible permitting, it is not a new vision: it is just a new weapon available to the old guard.

The corporate interests which benefit when these proposals become law once claimed such legislation was necessary to “create jobs.” Over time, the messaging evolved through “energy independence” to “energy dominance.” More recently, “national security” and the need to “beat China” have been the alleged justifications. Now these same special interests can claim we need to bar access to the courts and shut the public out of permitting decisions to achieve abundance.

The future we all want

UCS is a nonpartisan science advocacy organization. We advocate for robust science; accountability for fossil fuel corporations; Environmental Justice; democracy; clean energy; healthy and sustainably produced food; clean transportation; and a safer world. And at every turn, the forces lined up to oppose our advocacy are well-funded, powerful, entrenched special interests who profit from a lack of progress on any of those fronts.

Our experience tells us that curtailing the ability of regulators to place even minimal limitations on the appetites of those special interests will not unleash a new era of progressivism: it will only help the rich get richer.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blog-Thumbnail-Target-Missed-its-Mark.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:00:53.935647

The automaker delivered 710,347 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, according to company data released Tuesday. That figure reflects balanced gains across gasoline-powered and electric lineups. SUVs such as the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and Buick Envista all set records, while full-size pickups and large SUVs continued to drive profits. Through nine months, GM has sold 2.2 million vehicles, its strongest start to a year in more than a decade.

10 Coolest Cars That Rocked Pop-Up Headlights

The standout metric, however, was in EVs. GM delivered 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter, its highest volume yet and more than double last year’s pace. Year-to-date EV deliveries now total 144,668 units, cementing GM’s role as the No. 2 EV seller in the U.S., behind Tesla. Analysts credited expanded Ultium-based products, better availability, and competitive pricing.

Still, the strong results come with caveats. The federal $7,500 EV tax credit ended earlier this year under the Trump administration, prompting GM and Ford to quickly launch their own incentive programs of the same value. Analysts say those automaker-backed discounts helped sustain momentum into September, but it remains unclear whether demand will hold steady without federal support.

At the same time, GM’s profitability has lagged. The company reported a 35% income drop for the first half of 2025, citing rising costs, tariffs, and heavy EV investments.

Instead of abandoning all hope, solar advocates are shifting focus to state action.
Solar advocates zeroed in on state policies then, mostly pushing for renewable portfolio standards (RPS) requiring utilities to add solar to their portfolios.
Early state leadership A few governors have already taken a stand to communicate that their states are still open for solar business.
Solar advocates will need to play defense to mitigate the damage.","The Trump Administration’s attack on renewables has rocked the solar industry this year. The full impact of anti-solar legislation and executive orders may not be fully understood until 2026, when the residential tax credit ends, material restrictions begin and start-construction deadlines arrive for the large-scale ITC.

Instead of abandoning all hope, solar advocates are shifting focus to state action.

“Federal government, Congress, they’re walking away from these opportunities. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an opportunity here,” said Sachu Constantine, executive director of Vote Solar. “We’ve long made the case that the actual decisions about deployment, about what resources go into our grid, are made at the state-level.”

It’s not the first time strategies have shifted. During Donald Trump’s first presidency, a “blue wave” in 2018 awarded many governor seats to Democrats. Solar advocates zeroed in on state policies then, mostly pushing for renewable portfolio standards (RPS) requiring utilities to add solar to their portfolios. Now, enormous data center energy demand combined with overall home electrification are creating new, urgent priorities.

“It’s a more mature industry than it was back then. RPS is not really the driving factor these days,” said Sean Gallagher, senior VP of policy for SEIA. “It’s economics and the need for speed, and the attractiveness of solar and storage in terms of both affordability and reliability.”

State budget sensitivity

HR1 didn’t just decimate solar incentives. It stripped money from the states for crucial programs like Medicaid, student loan funding, SNAP benefits and school meals. States will be pressed to find money for many social programs impacted by HR1, so funding for renewable energy may be hard to come by.

Luckily, many efforts that could help reduce the overall cost of solar may not cost states much at all.

“A lot of this is not brand new, but it’s sort of a renewed emphasis on these nuts and bolts, things that states really can do to both facilitate and expedite bringing more resources online,” Gallagher said.

SEIA outlines some main objectives for all solar markets in its “Post-HR1 State Policy Roadmap.” For the larger market, these include enforcing interconnection timelines by penalizing utilities not in compliance, developing “flexible interconnection” policies to bring more solar online without requiring major grid updates and streamlining requirements for solar + storage projects on state lands.

On the small-scale front, SEIA is especially focused on helping residential installers navigate a post-25D market. The group will encourage AHJs to adopt automatic instant permitting via SolarAPP+, ensure policy is in place for companies to adopt third-party-ownership structures to capture the 48E ITC and work to expand statewide virtual power plant options.

“How can we really reduce cost, particularly in the residential sector, so that we can transition solar from a product that’s sold to a product that’s bought?” Gallagher said of SEIA’s focus.

Early state leadership

A few governors have already taken a stand to communicate that their states are still open for solar business.

“It’s what we’ve seen historically — when there’s been disruptions at the federal level, the leading states will step in and ensure that their trajectory toward their goals is at least maintained, if not further supported,” said Kevin Cray, VP of existing markets and regulatory affairs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued executive actions over the summer to help residents determine which renewable energy tax credits they qualify for, as well as ensure state agencies cut red tape and prioritize renewable energy projects.

“We must provide confidence to the clean energy industry that Colorado is open for business as tariffs, shifting federal rules, supply chain crunches and market uncertainty risk delaying investment in these affordable domestic energy resources,” wrote Polis in his executive letter.

CCSA worked directly with Polis’ office to offer recommendations for supporting solar in the face of federal uncertainty and was pleased to see its main points reflected in the letter.

“Some of the recommendations around flexible interconnection and stuff like that were very specific, and I think create some of that near-term certainty needed for investments to still move forward,” Cray said.

In Arizona, Gov. Katie Hobbs put forth an executive order in September called “Removing Barriers to Delivering Affordable Energy for Arizona,” with goals of streamlining permitting and speeding energy deployment, including renewables. It establishes the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce, which will develop plans to facilitate large-scale growth and expand Arizona’s clean energy economy.

SEIA and CCSA see these actions as great examples for other states to follow, especially Colorado’s specificity.

“That’s something that we’re certainly running state to state with at this point — trying to get other governors, administrative agencies, etc., to take similar steps as far as some of the exact provisions of the executive action,” Cray said.

Playing defense

While states that already lead on solar will continue to do so, influential oil and gas companies in others will be looking to take full advantage of the support of this “drill, baby drill” administration. Solar advocates will need to play defense to mitigate the damage.

“What’s unfortunate in some of those red states is that the big actors — let’s say the Duke [Energys] of the world, the Georgia Powers, the Southerns, FPLs — they know that solar is the best option. But they also know that in this environment, with the rhetoric coming out of the federal government, they can continue to try to cram some gas into the rate base,” Vote Solar’s Constantine said.

“Wherever we can, we want to get into the planning process early — the Integrated Resource Plans, where the regulators approve or shape the procurement plans for the utilities,” he continued.

Some of those negative actions are already popping up. Although Arizona’s governor supports solar power, the Arizona Corporation Commission unanimously voted to repeal the state’s RPS the month before she put forth her executive order. And the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada recently voted to approve a new rate design that changes the solar net-metering structure to 15-minute netting and adds mandatory demand charges to all customers. Instead of balancing solar production against usage over a full month, customers will now only get credit for excess energy within each 15-minute window. SEIA said the decision “discourages private investment in reliable, affordable, clean energy at a time when the grid needs every electron it can get to power Nevada’s economy.”

Still, the country needs massive amounts of new energy on the grid, and it needs it quickly. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is forecasting continued average electrical consumption growth of 1.7% through 2026, after growth was nearly flat from 2005 to 2020. Solar has consistently been the fastest-growing source of electricity to meet that demand. Advocates plan to cut through the administration’s rhetoric and stick to those facts to win as many policy battles as possible in this trying time.

“We have to bring a real clear focus now on the economic proposition that solar provides and the speed to power that we can do. We have our work cut out for us. But, as you saw at RE+, I think the industry feels like we’re going to figure out a way to manage through this,” Gallagher said.",https://news.energyjobline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/energy_jobline_icons-300x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:05:31.967298

Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline.
Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects.
The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.
It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.","The most cost-effective and quickest way to conserve the Colorado River’s shrinking water supply amid persistent drought and rapid population growth is changing how states handle the largest use of water on the river: agriculture.

Agriculture uses about 80% of the river’s water, but the good news is that paying farmers not to use water allotted to them has proved to be remarkably cost-effective.

That’s according to a comprehensive study examining 462 federally funded Colorado River conservation and supply projects using available spending data from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association last week, was conducted by UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy in partnership with the Utah Rivers Council.

The water projects examined – ranging from large-scale infrastructure such as reservoirs and wastewater treatment plants to agricultural water use – totaled about $1 billion in federal funding between 2004 and 2024.

“How much water is actually being saved for every dollar we are spending?” asks Mehdi Nemati, an assistant professor of public policy, co-author of the study. “If we want to be more efficient or gain more water saved per dollar spent, then answering this question matters.”

“The big message is not all water savings are equal. Some projects saved water at a fraction of the cost of others,” he continued.

Agricultural conservation programs conserved water for as low as $69.89 per acre-foot. On average, agricultural conservation programs cost about $417 per acre-foot, while local supply projects —such as reservoirs, wells, and wastewater treatment facilities—cost more than $2,400 per acre-foot on average. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land to a depth of one foot, or about 325,851 gallons.)

“Spending money to conserve water within the agriculture sector seems to be one of the most cost-effective ways. There’s also a lot of room to improve and save more water in this sector,” Nemati said. “About 80% of the water goes to agriculture. If you’re using a big share and it’s more cost-effective, then that’s going to need to be the target.”

Historically, farmers have been reluctant to lower their water use out of fear the government might take their water permanently. But the study found that agricultural conservation programs, particularly those that provided financial incentives to promote behavioral changes among farmers, were successful at delivering water savings at a relatively low cost.

The most common type of agricultural conservation program was paying farmers who rely on the Colorado River to reduce their water use on crops during certain non-critical periods, saving an average of 747 acre-feet per year at a cost of about $140 per acre-foot.

Paying farmers to temporarily leave their fields empty – particularly for water-intensive crops like alfalfa – produced an average annual water saving of 17,500 acre-feet per year at an average cost of about $193 per acre-foot, according to the study.

“Grass, alfalfa, corn pasture, these are all water intensive crops. That’s where we get our most savings per dollar, and there is huge room for savings. I would say these are low hanging fruit,” Nemati said.

Other programs studied paid farmers to replace flood irrigation with precision methods such as drip or sprinkler systems, which demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements while maintaining agricultural productivity.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent about 30% of water conservation funding between 2004 and 2024 on agricultural projects.

Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline.

Water-intensive crops are where the savings are

Much of the funding used to pay farmers to conserve Colorado River water was provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which helped double agricultural water conservation from 1.5 million acre-feet of water to over 3 million acre-feet of water, according to the study.

Water recycling and treatment facilities also proved to be a cost-effective way to conserve substantial amounts of water in the long-term, despite higher initial construction costs. Water recycling and treatment facilities had an average lifetime cost of $385 per acre-feet with an average annual water savings of about 18,600 acre-feet.

Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects. California got the lion’s share of that funding, about 80%. Upper Basin states received only 4% of reuse funding, while Tribal areas received no funding.

There’s a lot of room for improvement in water recycling across states that rely on the Colorado River. One recent study found that Upper Basin states – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – recycled less than 5% of their water, as compared to Lower Basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada– which recycled more than 30% of their water.

The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.

Between 2004 and 2024, Upper Basin states only received about 6% of overall water conservation spending by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, while about 75% was directed to the Lower Basin, and about 19% was designated for Tribal areas, some of which extend across both regions.

Nevada received nearly $6 million for 28 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of roughly 1,500 acre-feet at a cost of about $3,800 per acre-foot.

It’s a stark contrast to Upper Basin states like Colorado, which received about $610,000 in federal funding for 47 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of about 2,100 acre-feet at a cost of about $285 per acre-foot.

It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.

“In some areas in Nevada there has been tremendous investment in the urban side and efficiency gains in the urban side. But if you’re looking at the lowest dollar per acre feet, water-intensive crops are the areas we want to target,” Nemati said.

“There are areas in the Upper Basin that could save water for a fraction of money being used in Nevada or southern California,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/52627025695_ab463b4dc5_o-1024x7681759764523.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=VisWZGsn,N,,2025-10-06 13:05:17.815192

The total electrical generation from coal-fired power plants has decreased, while wind power generation has increased.
Efforts are ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions from existing baseload power plants and other energy generation sites through capture and sequestration methods.
Natural gas production is also growing in the Bakken region in western North Dakota.
Located near the existing Pioneer Generation Station northwest of Williston, PGSIV is Basin Electric’s largest generation project built in North Dakota since the 1980s.","Electricity generation in the U.S. has been growing rapidly this year as a result of increasing demands for power from data centers and industrial customers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The agency expects that total U.S. generation by the electric power sector will grow by 2.3% this year and another 3% in 2026. Solar power is expected to supply the largest share of the increase in both years.

North Dakota produces significantly more energy than is consumed, and the state is a net exporter of energy. Overall, energy consumption has increased over the past decade, primarily through the growth of the industrial sectors, according to a September 2024 draft research report of the state’s energy security and resilience plans by the Energy & Environmental Research Center for the North Dakota Department of Commerce. The total electrical generation from coal-fired power plants has decreased, while wind power generation has increased. Efforts are ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions from existing baseload power plants and other energy generation sites through capture and sequestration methods.

Most of the electricity produced in the state is generated by coal-fired power plants, although electricity generation from renewable wind power has grown quickly over the past 10 years. Natural gas production is also growing in the Bakken region in western North Dakota.

Taking advantage of the increased natural gas production, Basin Electric Power Cooperative will build a natural gas-fueled combined-cycle power plant in Williams County, called Bison Generation Station. The need for the station was determined through the co-op’s load forecasting and power supply planning process, a release states. This includes an annual load forecast, which is a cooperative effort among distribution members, generation and transmission members, and Basin Electric for its entire service area.

“Basin Electric’s 2024 Load Forecast highlighted strong oil and gas-related growth in the Bakken region, in addition to growth across Basin Electric’s service territory ,” said Benjamin Hertz, Basin Electric’s manager of power supply planning. “Bison Generation Station addresses the growing energy demands of member electric cooperatives, which serve a wide variety of traditional load sectors including agriculture, oil and gas, ethanol, manufacturing and residential.”

Crews began initial site grading in August under the observation of North Dakota Public Service Commission’s third-party inspector. The grading work was done this summer and fall to prepare the site for the planned construction start in 2026.

The flagship resource for Basin Electric’s membership will be capable of providing a long-term dispatchable supply of generation to the area, the release states, which can be delivered across the co-op’s service territory in the Southwest Power Pool.

Another project for the utility is the newly completed Pioneer Generation Station Phase IV. The natural gas-fueled generation facility is a combination of combustion turbine and reciprocating engine units that provide dispatch flexibility while addressing near-term load growth and long-term grid stability in the Bakken region, a release about the project states. Located near the existing Pioneer Generation Station northwest of Williston, PGSIV is Basin Electric’s largest generation project built in North Dakota since the 1980s. It will generate approximately 580 megawatts (MW) of electricity.

Gavin McCollam, Basin Electric senior vice president and chief operating officer, said the successful completion of the PGSIV project – on time, under budget and with a great safety record – is exactly what the team strives for every single time.

Baton Rouge-based MMR is the largest open-shop electrical contractor in the U.S.

Operations at the renovated building are expected to begin in Q1 of 2026.

LAFAYETTE, La. – MMR Group announced it is growing its Louisiana footprint with a $55.2 million investment for a new assembly facility in Lafayette Parish that will expand production of electrical components used in high-growth sectors such as data centers and semiconductors.

The company is expected to create 196 direct new jobs in Lafayette over the next 10 years with an average annual salary of $85,000 and retain approximately 3,000 current positions across the state. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 335 indirect new jobs, for a total of 531 potential new job opportunities in the Acadiana Region.

“For more than 30 years, MMR Group has helped power Louisiana’s economy, and this expansion proves how vital our homegrown companies are to the state’s success,” said Governor Jeff Landry. “This administration is committed to ensuring that MMR, and all Louisiana businesses, benefit from the historic momentum we are seeing across our state, turning growth into opportunity for every region and every family.”

The retrofitted facility will allow MMR to produce modular systems on site, all critical elements in the construction of AI and data centers throughout the nation.

“At MMR, we are committed to excellence and scaling our business operations to meet the ever-growing needs of our clients,” said MMR President and CEO James B. “Pepper” Rutland. “In doing so, we have the unique ability to provide our core E&I capabilities alongside an in-house suite of specialty services, such as the new modular systems division. This allows us to streamline processes and assist our clients in completing complex projects within scope, budget and more efficiently.”

Founded in 1991 in Baton Rouge, MMR Group has grown from a small electrical service company into the largest open-shop electrical contractor in the U.S., providing engineering, construction, maintenance and technical services for industrial and commercial clients worldwide.

With a long history of supporting Louisiana’s key industries, most recently exemplified by its ongoing work at Venture Global’s LNG facility in Plaquemines Parish, MMR’s announcement occurs during the Acadiana Region leg of LED’s Driving Louisiana Opportunity tour, a statewide initiative highlighting employers that strengthen communities and fuel growth across Louisiana.

“MMR’s expansion is exactly what the Driving Louisiana Opportunity tour is all about, showcasing the companies that have long built our economy and created opportunities statewide,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Our record-setting retention and expansion efforts are ensuring Louisiana companies have the confidence to reinvest and grow right here at home.”

MMR has purchased an existing facility at 939 West Pont Des Mouton Rd. and anticipates the start of renovations to begin immediately with expected completion by the end of the year.

“This $55 million investment is a strong vote of confidence in Lafayette’s workforce and business climate,” Lafayette Mayor-President Monique B. Boulet said. “It brings nearly 200 new jobs for our residents and stability for families across Louisiana. Just off I-49, MMR will transform an existing building into a state-of-the-art assembly facility and continue to fuel an industry that powers our everyday lives. It’s proof that when businesses choose Lafayette, they choose growth, innovation and opportunity for everyone.”

To encourage MMR to expand its manufacturing and assembly business in Lafayette, the state of Louisiana offered a competitive incentives package including a $500,000 performance-based grant for building renovations and the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption and High Impact Jobs programs.

“We are thrilled to welcome MMR Group’s state-of-the-art assembly facility to Lafayette which represents a significant milestone in LEDA’s ongoing economic diversification efforts,” Lafayette Economic Development Authority President and CEO Mandi Mitchell said. “This announcement builds on the momentum we’ve seen throughout 2025 since the announcement of Meta’s major investment in Louisiana. Together, these projects reinforce Lafayette’s position as a premier destination for advanced manufacturing and technology-driven industries. We look forward to a long and prosperous partnership with MMR Group.”

“MMR’s decision to expand in Lafayette underscores Acadiana’s growing role in powering the industries of the future, from hyperscale data centers to advanced semiconductor manufacturing,” One Acadiana President and CEO Troy Wayman said. “This $55.2 million investment not only brings nearly 200 new high-quality jobs to our region but also reinforces the strength of the more than 3,000 jobs MMR already sustains across Louisiana. This announcement is at the core of the reason for economic development, creating and preserving jobs. We are proud to work alongside the LEDA as they continue to expand the parish’s economic base and strengthen opportunities for businesses and residents alike.”

According to Jefferies, Ford‘s strong compliance with US fuel economy and emissions rules, combined with earned regulatory credits, has kept its compliance costs low.

The investment bank also raised its price target on Ford by 33.3% to $12.

Ford‘s shares have closed at $12.67 on Friday and have surged nearly 30% year to date.

Analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a new research note — obtained by PriceTarget — that Ford‘s management had already mentioned a “multi-billion opportunity” for the company given “looser” GHG (greenhouse gas) and CO2 regulations.

This allows the company to concentrate on selling more profitable petrol and diesel models — especially pick-up trucks and SUVs, which make up a large portion of its US sales.

Jefferies expects Ford “will refrain from providing 2026 guidance until next year,” after the company suspended its 2025 guidance in May, citing the uncertainty of the US tariffs’ impact.

By then, Ford said it expected to take a $1.5 billion hit caused by Trump’s tariffs.

However, the analyst said that the automaker “could comment on potential mix benefits starting in Q4 and a shift in EV strategy.”

Last week, the company announced that it delivered a record 85,789 electric vehicles in the third quarter, as demand jumped ahead of the EV consumer credit deadline on September 30.

“We already assumed lower losses from model e,” Houchois noted, as Ford both shifts EV exposure to Europe, “where unit losses are lower,” and as the company normalizes “spending on the Universal Platform scheduled for 2027.”

In August, the analyst had already said that the automaker should be able to materially reduce losses at its Model e electric vehicle unit from 2026, pointing to Q2 results that showed all incremental revenue over Q1 coming from Europe, while divisional losses held steady.

Ford announced in August that it will invest “approximately $5 billion” to develop a new EV platform and launch a midsize four-door electric pickup in 2027 with a target starting price of $30,000.

According to Jefferies, Ford‘s strong compliance with US fuel economy and emissions rules, combined with earned regulatory credits, has kept its compliance costs low.

In a earlier note, Houchois raised the firm’s 2025 adjusted EBIT estimate for Ford by 2% to $6.9 billion, with its Credit division offsetting weaker Pro segment results.

They also lifted its free cash flow forecast by 12% to $2.7 billion on a higher internal Credit dividend — though still below company guidance.

On Monday, Houchois wrote that 43% of Ford‘s US volume is in full size pick-ups and SUVs, while estimating that 60 to 80% of North American sales and profits are coming from Ford‘s Pro and Blue divisions.

“Loosening current constraints” on a mix of higher CO2 mix models, like the Raptor and ST-Line, “should enable Ford to offset tariffs and improve earnings next year.”

Jefferies expects Ford “to remain committed to an electrification strategy,” saying that it should benefit from a longer adjustment period.”

Given Friday’s closing price of Ford shares, the new price target implies a downside of 5.3%.

And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.
“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.
The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.","U.S. government support of sustainable aviation fuel has waned, shifting the impetus for increasing its production to the states. But progress continues.

“It’s a pivot,” says Keith Sawyer, Avfuel manager of alternative fuels. “The focus had been typically on the federal government; now investors are including what may or may not be offered by states in their calculations, in their rates of return on investment in facilities.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) that became law with President Donald Trump’s signature on July 4 amended the existing 45Z clean fuel production credit (CFPC) to benefit biofuel producers instead of blenders and extended it for two years through 2029. Added to the tax code during the Biden administration through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CFPC was set to expire in 2027.

The continuation of the tax credit is cause for some optimism that ongoing development of SAF capacity is supported—given that one of Trump’s early actions after becoming president in January was to pause funding disbursements under the IRA, which was considered a major achievement of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.

Trump’s executive order was slowed by legal challenges, but the OBBB approved by the Republican majority in Congress contains a section that rescinds unobligated balances of the FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant program, also established under the IRA.

The Biden administration had announced $291 million in FAST grants in August 2024, primarily for 22 projects “that produce, transport, blend or store sustainable aviation fuel.” The largest single grant—$50 million—went to Martinez Renewables LLC, a 50/50 joint venture of Marathon Petroleum and SAF producer Neste, to fund the conversion of a Marathon facility in Martinez, California, for renewable fuels production.

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.

Under the OBBB, the CFPC has been modified; the value of the credit for production of “neat” or pure, unblended SAF declines from $1.75-per-gallon to $1-per-gallon after 2025, aligning it with the credit for renewable diesel. And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. Sugar cane, soybeans, tallow, used oils and greases sourced outside of North America won’t qualify.

“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.

The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Also welcoming the new 45Z credit as one of the OBBB’s “America First” energy provisions was Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a coalition that joins Airbus, Airlines for America, Delta Air Lines, and NBAA representing the aviation industry with agriculture groups and energy companies ExxonMobil and BP.

Ready to explore how your facility qualifies for New Jersey manufacturing tax credits?","Governor Phil Murphy signed the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program into law on August 13, 2025. This marks New Jersey’s most significant manufacturing investment in recent history.

The program allocates $500 million in New Jersey manufacturing tax credits. But these aren’t standard tax incentives. They’re transferable, stackable, and designed to reward manufacturers who think long-term.

Why New Jersey is betting big on manufacturing now

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) has already approved 431 applications through its Manufacturing Voucher Program, distributing over $66.2 million. These companies committed to investing $252.7 million in return, nearly four times the state’s contribution.

That’s the multiplier effect New Jersey wants to replicate at scale.

The state faces increasing pressure from federal tariffs and supply chain disruptions. This program utilizes $500 million from existing Aspire and Emerge credits, redirecting them specifically toward manufacturing job creation and in-state production capacity.

Understanding New Jersey manufacturing tax credits

The credit calculation follows a specific formula. You receive the lesser of three amounts:

Formula 1: 0.1% of your total capital investment × number of new full-time jobs created

Formula 2: 25% of your total qualified capital investment

Formula 3: $150 million (program maximum per project)

Let’s make this concrete. Say your facility plans a $50 million equipment upgrade and will create 100 new positions.

Formula 1: ($50M × 0.001) × 100 = $5 million

Formula 2: $50M × 0.25 = $12.5 million

Formula 3: $150M (not applicable)

You’d receive $5 million in New Jersey manufacturing tax credits under this scenario.

The clean energy carve-out creates first mover advantage

$100 million in tax credits during the first two years are reserved exclusively for clean energy product manufacturers. This includes solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen production.

After two years, unused clean energy credits roll into general manufacturing allocation. This creates a window where clean energy manufacturers face less competition for funds.

If your facility produces components for renewable energy systems, you’re competing for a smaller pool initially. That improves your odds significantly.

Bonus credits stack and they add up fast

The base credit is just your starting point. New Jersey offers stackable bonuses for companies holding state business certifications, operating in Opportunity Zones, or maintaining collective bargaining agreements.

These bonuses can add up to 5% to your total credit. On a $10 million award, that’s an additional $500,000.

Bonus eligibility categories:

Minority and Women Business Enterprises (MWBE) certification

Veteran-Owned Business (VOB) certification

Opportunity Zone location

Collective bargaining or labor harmony agreements

Multiple bonuses can apply simultaneously. A MWBE-certified manufacturer in an Opportunity Zone with union representation qualifies for multiple stacked benefits.

What “Qualified Business Facility” actually means

Your project must center on a physical manufacturing facility in New Jersey. The minimum capital investment threshold sits at $10 million.

Capital investment includes:

Manufacturing equipment and machinery

Facility construction or expansion

Technology systems supporting production

Technology systems supporting production

It excludes

Working capital

Inventory

Non-manufacturing administrative spaces

The facility must remain operational in New Jersey for 10 years. This isn’t a short-term play.

Job creation requirements go beyong headcount

You must create at least 20 new full-time positions. But quantity isn’t enough, these positions must meet specific wage requirements.

The program emphasizes “good-paying jobs“. While exact wage thresholds aren’t published yet, expect them to align with prevailing wage standards for manufacturing in New Jersey.

The program also requires partnerships with New Jersey educational institutions or workforce entities. This ensures your hiring connects with local talent development infrastructure.

Environmental standards are non-negotiable

Every participating facility must comply with minimum environmental and sustainability standards. These requirements recognize that modern manufacturing success depends on sustainable practices.

Expect documentation requirements around:

Energy efficiency measures

Waste reduction protocols

Emissions management

Water conservation practices

Green manufacturing isn’t just good for New Jersey manufacturing tax credits eligibility, it’s increasingly what customers demand.

Credits are issued over five years not upfront

Your total credit award gets distributed over a five-year period. Annual disbursements depend on continued compliance.

You must maintain:

Required job levels

Facility operations in New Jersey

Educational/workforce partnerships

Prevailing wage standards

Environmental compliance

Fail any requirement, and that year’s credit is forfeited. This structure protects taxpayer investment while ensuring manufacturers deliver promised benefits.

The transferability feature changes everything

These credits are transferable, meaning you can sell or assign them.

For manufacturers without sufficient tax liability to use credits immediately, transferability creates liquidity. You can monetize credits through sale to companies with tax liability.

This transforms credits from future tax savings into current capital, exactly what growing manufacturers need.

Unused credits can be carried forward for 10 years, providing additional flexibility for facilities with variable tax liability.

Applications open soon on first-come, first-served basis

The NJEDA will accept rolling applications through March 1, 2029. But the $500 million pool operates first-come, first-served.

Early applications have strategic advantages:

Less competition for available funds

More time to gather documentation

Ability to adjust project plans based on feedback

Projects already in planning stages should accelerate preparation. Every month of delay means more competitors enter the queue.

What should manufacturers do right now?

Assess project timing: Can you reach the $10 million capital investment threshold? Do you have expansion plans that could be accelerated?

Review workforce plans: Will you create at least 20 new positions? How do wages compare to prevailing standards?

Identify partnership opportunities: Which New Jersey educational institutions or workforce programs align with your hiring needs?

Document sustainability measures: What environmental standards does your facility already meet? Where can you strenghten compliance?

Calculate potential credits: Run the formulas with your actual investment and job creation numbers. Understand your realistic award range.

The strategic context: Why this matters beyond tax savings

New Jersey positions itself as having “the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in the nation“. This program advances that vision through targeted manufacturing support.

For manufacturers, New Jersey manufacturing tax credits represent more than tax relief. They signal where the state is investing infrastructure, workforce development and regulatory support.

Facilities that establish themselves now gain access to an ecosystem being actively built around manufacturing success.

Next steps for your facility

The NJEDA hasn’t opened applications yet. But preparation determines success.

Companies that win competitive funding programs share common traits: they start early, document thoroughly and align projects with program priorities.

Tesla has teased an October 7 event, likely to unveil a more affordable Model Y and sustain sales.

Tesla expects the more affordable Model Y to be 20% cheaper to manufacture and aims to reach an annual production of 250,000 units in the U.S. by 2026.

The teaser follows record quarterly deliveries ahead of the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, but analysts warn that sales may slow without incentives.

On Sunday, Tesla teased an event on October 7, sending shares up 2% in premarket trading as investors and analysts speculated that the company may unveil a long-awaited, more affordable electric vehicle.

The teaser, a nine-second video posted on the social media platform X, showed a vehicle with its headlights illuminated in a dark setting. A second video hinted at the scheduled date with “10/7” at the end, stoking anticipation for the announcement.

Analysts expect Tesla to unveil a lower-cost version of its Model Y, which the company had previously delayed in the U.S. market. In June, Tesla announced that it had completed the “first builds” of the vehicle, with plans to begin selling it in the fourth quarter and gradually ramp up production. The stripped-down Model Y is projected to cost roughly 20% less to produce than the refreshed version.

The teaser follows Tesla’s record quarterly deliveries for the three months ending September, fueled by a surge in purchases before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. However, analysts warn that sales may slow in the coming months without the incentive. Wall Street estimates Tesla’s deliveries will climb to 1.85 million vehicles in 2025, with the new model contributing about 155,610 units by 2026, according to Visible Alpha data.

Tesla faces mounting pressure from an aging vehicle lineup. The automaker has not introduced a new mass-market model in years, relying instead on incremental updates to the Model 3 and Model Y. The company’s most recent major launch, the Cybertruck, has underperformed, prompting the company to offer discounts on its inventory. A U.S. recall filing in March showed that 46,096 Cybertrucks were built between its November 2023 debut and early 2024.

The move adds a third production site to existing facilities in Edina, Minnesota and Jubail, Saudi Arabia, positioning the company to meet rising demand across the Asia-Pacific region more efficiently and sustainably.

The agreement, scheduled to close in Q4 2025, forms part of DuPont’s long-term strategy to strengthen regional manufacturing and reduce the distance between production and end use.

It directly supports DuPont’s flagship water technology brand, FilmTec, which produces high-efficiency membranes used in reverse osmosis water purification.

""This acquisition aligns with our strategy to enhance our global manufacturing capabilities for FilmTec RO elements and better serve our customers in China and the Asia Pacific region,"" explains Jeroen Bloemhard, President of DuPont's Healthcare & Water Technologies segment.

""With an expanded global manufacturing footprint, DuPont remains dedicated to providing solutions that purify and reclaim water sources, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and resource challenges.""

Local manufacturing to support resilient water supply chains

Reverse osmosis is a pressure-driven process that removes salts, minerals and dissolved solids from water. It is widely used across sectors such as power generation, food production and municipal water supply.

With growing industrial demand and increased urbanisation across the Asia-Pacific region, DuPont sees regional production as essential for fast and reliable delivery of water treatment technologies.

By manufacturing FilmTec RO elements locally in China, DuPont says it can reduce delivery lead times, simplify logistics and better navigate market-specific regulations.

The newly-acquired Sinochem site is already qualified to produce FilmTec membranes for use in China and the wider Asia-Pacific market. The goal is to localise supply for regional customers while increasing flexibility and lowering operational risk.

DuPont’s approach is based on matching production capabilities with geographic demand. It allows the company to serve its core customers, industrial users, municipal water authorities and food and beverage manufacturers, through shorter supply routes and improved regional agility.

The localisation strategy also plays a key role in supporting supply chain continuity. In an environment where global logistics are often strained and regulatory conditions evolve rapidly, the company says having regional manufacturing nodes is now essential.

Water treatment and the energy transition

DuPont’s broader water technology portfolio already purifies more than 50 million gallons of water per minute across 112 countries, through a combination of membrane and resin products.

The technologies are used in desalination, demineralisation and water reuse applications.

FilmTec, as the core brand for RO membranes, is widely recognised for delivering high performance in demanding conditions. The company continues to focus on the intersection of water and energy challenges.

DuPont’s water technologies are used not only in traditional industrial applications but also in energy-related sectors, including lithium extraction and green hydrogen production. Both areas require large volumes of purified water and are central to future clean energy strategies.

By adding a localised manufacturing base in China, DuPont can respond more effectively to these emerging demands. The move also supports sustainability by reducing reliance on long-distance shipping, which lowers the carbon footprint of supply and improves the speed of delivery for critical components.

The acquisition strengthens DuPont’s ability to supply essential infrastructure components at a time when water scarcity is intensifying and pressure to reuse industrial water is rising.

The combination of regional production, reliable technology and application-specific expertise positions DuPont to address both environmental and operational challenges in a growing market.

Preparing for rising water demand in Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region is facing one of the fastest increases in demand for advanced water treatment solutions. Industries and governments alike are investing in solutions that can support growing populations, climate resilience and circular water use.

Reverse osmosis is central to these efforts, offering a proven method for turning previously unusable water sources into clean, usable water.

With this acquisition, DuPont is aligning its operations with these long-term trends.

The decision to build regional resilience through local manufacturing is not just a cost-saving measure, it is also a forward-looking approach to securing water supply chains for sectors that increasingly depend on reliable purification technologies.

By reinforcing its FilmTec manufacturing network in China, DuPont is aiming to meet regional needs quickly, adapt to local conditions and deliver RO elements more sustainably.

As demand for clean water and reuse solutions grows, DuPont’s expanded footprint could play a key role in enabling more efficient and secure water systems across Asia-Pacific.

The Sinochem facility looks set to serve as a strategic hub in DuPont’s effort to balance global supply capacity with localised market response.

Through this model, the company is working to ensure its technologies can be delivered where and when they are needed most, while building supply chains that are both robust and responsible.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8a15e740bc3ecfb1d7e9c3456e7d691a:f235d9d7d5a5552548c185af57ffb45a/reverse-osmosis.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:00:15.884580

Although EPA risk evaluations are based on theoretical and conservatively modeled conditions that are often criticized, the draft evaluation demonstrates a shift in the EPA's position as it relates to D4. For the first time, the agency has concluded that D4 may pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment under certain circumstances. The EPA found that D4—a chemical precursor widely used to produce various silicone chemicals and an ingredient in certain personal care products—presents unreasonable risk to human health via several potential exposure pathways that are covered under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Key findings include:

Human Health Risks

Unreasonable risks were identified for workers across 23 conditions of use, and for consumers under one condition of use, when recommended personal protective equipment is not used.

Environmental Risks

D4 was found to pose unreasonable environmental risks under seven conditions of use.

No Risk Identified

Over 30 additional conditions of use were evaluated and found not to present unreasonable risks to human health or the environment.

The conditions allegedly associated with elevated risk primarily involved manufacturing, processing, and industrial uses of D4 and its derivatives in adhesive, sealant, paint, coating, corrosion inhibitor, and solvent applications. Notably, the conditions of use considered by EPA are theoretical and conservatively modeled exposure scenarios that do not account for the use of personal protective equipment and other safeguards utilized to reduce chemical exposure in industrial and environmental settings. Therefore, they may not represent actual exposure scenarios for this chemical.

In light of EPA's draft evaluation, companies operating in industrial sectors should continue to monitor future developments concerning D4 and consult counsel as appropriate. Companies can also submit comments to EPA on the risk evaluation until 17 November 2025. EPA will hold a virtual public meeting about the risk evaluation in early December 2025.

Our Emerging Contaminants team is well positioned and uniquely equipped to assist in matters relating to the evolving legal and regulatory landscape surrounding D4.

Questioning the Science President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.
In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.
Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.
Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.","The Trump administration’s plan to revoke a key finding that certain greenhouse gases pose a risk to human health removes one of the most potent tools for emissions regulation from the last two decades, according to former EPA air office leadership.

The proposal to nix the 2009 endangerment finding is on a fast-track for finalization, and former leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency say it will claw back US climate progress and create a vacuum of strong GHG regulations.

“The political leadership is essentially performing a lobotomy on itself,” according to Joe Goffman, who led the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden. “The surgery began when they essentially shed all of the climate staff in the last couple of months.”

Three former EPA Administrators—William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman, and Gina McCarthy—wrote to current Administrator Lee Zeldin Sept. 22, expressing opposition to the endangerment proposal and urging him to “follow the law, the science, and EPA’s mission” by withdrawing the revocation plan.

Following through with the plan, in combination with the agency’s decision to end greenhouse gas reporting requirements, jeopardizes emissions enforcement under the Clean Air Act, Whitman said in an interview with Bloomberg Law.

“The whole point behind all of this is to stop regulating, the irony that’s lost on most people, that we are banning Tylenol, but we don’t seem to care about air pollution,” Whitman said, referencing unproven claims from the Trump administration about the alleged dangers of the pain and fever reducer.

Questioning the Science

President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.

The EPA is also looking to cut its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which would end agency insight into how much GHG pollution is coming from large emitters across the country.

In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.

Supporters of Trump’s plan to kill the finding this time around echo some of the justifications used in unsuccessful petitions of the past, namely that the finding puts undue regulatory pressure on industry and is based on faulty or incomplete scientific record.

The proposal itself relies heavily on a Department of Energy report that casts doubt on the extensive scientific record on climate change, claiming that carbon-induced warming “might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial.”

Creating Uncertainty

Staff who served during the agency’s early climate work in the late 90s and early 2000s fought for the type of change the endangerment finding eventually brought to the EPA’s air rulemaking regime, and see major backsliding on climate mitigation without such a crucial tool.

Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.

But those efforts “were not getting the kind of emissions reductions that science was clearly showing would be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes and smoke stacks,” Symons said.

The revocation proposal is currently just past its public comment period, and working its way to finalization. Once final, legal challenges are all but inevitable, which many clean air experts say hurts industry as much as public health with prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.

“It’s the worst case scenario for our safety,” he said. “It’s the worst case scenario for business, because the one thing that hurts everybody is having this chaotic wrecking ball approach that nobody thinks will stand up over the long term.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/9eece9d/2147483647/crop/5996x2311+0+177/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fc4%2F72754f4d49ad98904a2e0d6fb29e%2Fdec3-smog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:28.819086

Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good.
I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact.
I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too.
They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them.","But I don’t think this is a reason to be pessimistic. I see it as cause for optimism, because humans are very good at inventing things. In fact, we’ve already created many tools that are reducing emissions. In just the past 10 years, energy breakthroughs have lowered the global forecast for emissions in 2040 by 40%. In other words, because of the human capacity to innovate, we are on course to reduce emissions substantially by 2040 even if nothing else changes.

And I am confident that more positive changes are coming. I’ve been learning about global warming and investing in ideas to stop it for the past 20 years. I’ve connected with unbiased scientists and innovators who are committed to preventing a climate disaster. Ten years ago, some of them joined me in creating Breakthrough Energy, an investment group whose sole purpose is to accelerate clean energy innovation. We’ve supported more than 150 companies so far, many of which have blossomed into major businesses such as Fervo Energy and Redwood Materials, two of this year’s Companies to Watch. [Editor’s note: Mr. Gates did not participate in the selection process of this year’s companies and was not aware that two Breakthrough investments had been selected when he agreed to write this essay.]

Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good. They will remake virtually every aspect of the world’s economy in the coming years, transforming energy markets, manufacturing, transportation, and many types of industry and food production. Some of these efforts will require long-term commitments, but it’s important that we act now. And what’s more, it’s already clear where the opportunities lie.

In the past decade, an ecosystem of thousands of innovators, investors, and industry leaders has emerged to work on every aspect of the problem. This year’s list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch shows just a few of the many examples.

Although much of this innovation ecosystem has matured on American shores, it has become a global movement that won’t be stopped by new obstacles in the US. It’s unfortunate that governments in the US and other countries have decided to cut funding for climate innovations and reverse some of the policies that help breakthrough ideas get to scale. In this environment, we need to be more rigorous than ever about spending our time, money, and ingenuity on efforts that will have the biggest impact.

How do we figure out which ones those are? First, by understanding which activities are responsible for the most emissions. I group them into five categories: electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and heating and cooling for buildings.

Of course, the zero-carbon tools we have today aren’t distributed evenly across these sectors. In some sectors, like electricity, we’ve made a great deal of progress. In others, like agriculture and manufacturing, we’ve made much less. To compare progress across the board, I use what I call the Green Premium, which is the difference in cost between the clean way of doing something and the conventional way that produces emissions.

For example, sustainable aviation fuel now costs more than twice as much as conventional jet fuel, so it has a Green Premium of over 100%. Solar and wind power have grown quickly because in many cases they’re cheaper than conventional sources of electricity—that is, they have a negative Green Premium.

The Green Premium isn’t purely financial. To be competitive, clean alternatives also need to be as practical as what they’re replacing. Far more people will buy EVs once you can charge one up as quickly as you can fill your tank with gasoline.

I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact. Where it’s high, as in the case of jet fuel, we need innovators and investors to jump on the problem. Where it’s low or even negative, we need to overcome the barriers that are keeping the technologies from reaching a global scale.

A new technology has to overcome a lot of challenges to beat the incumbents, but being able to compete on cost is absolutely essential. So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. Think big. If your technology can be competitive enough to eventually eliminate at least 1% of global emissions per year—that’s 0.5 gigatons—you’re on the right track.

I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too. They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them. This is not just a public good: The countries that win the race to develop these breakthroughs will create jobs, hold enormous economic power for decades to come, and become more energy independent.

In addition, young scientists and entrepreneurs should think about how they can put their skills toward these challenges. It’s an exciting time—the people who begin a career in clean technology today will have an enormous impact on human welfare. If you need pointers, the Climate Tech Atlas published last month by Breakthrough Energy and other partners is an excellent guide to the technologies that are essential for decarbonizing the economy and helping people adapt to a warmer climate.

Finally, I’d encourage investors to put serious money into companies with technologies that can meaningfully reduce the Green Premium. Consider it an investment in what will be the biggest growth industry of the 21st century. Companies have made dramatic progress on better and cleaner solutions in every sector; what many of them need now is private-sector capital and partnerships to help them reach the scale at which they’ll have a real impact on emissions.

Transforming the entire physical economy is an unprecedented task, and it can only be accomplished through markets—by supporting companies with breakthrough ideas that beat fossil fuels on cost and practicality. It’s going to take investors who are both patient and willing to accept the risk that some companies will fail. Of course, governments and nonprofits have a role in the energy transition too, but ultimately, our success will hinge on climate innovators’ ability to build profitable companies.

If we get this right—and I believe we will—then in the next decade, we’ll see fewer news stories about missed emissions targets and more stories about how emissions are dropping fast because the world invented and deployed breakthrough ideas: clean liquid fuels that power passenger jets and cargo ships; neighborhoods built with zero-emissions steel and cement; fusion plants that generate an inexhaustible supply of clean electricity.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bill-Gates_Headshot_social.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 08:00:20.095043

That's why we've spent years building wind farms across the UK and beyond and created innovative ways for our customers to join the green energy revolution.

Now we're taking our biggest international leap yet. We've just launched our first African energy fund with the goal of mobilising £250 million over the next three years to bring clean energy to communities across the continent.

Unlocking Africa’s Renewable Potential

Africa is home to nearly 40% of the world's renewable energy potential. Yet this energy-rich continent receives just 2% of global clean energy investment. Millions of people still lack reliable electricity despite sitting on some of the planet's best solar and wind resources.

That’s exactly what we want to change. To supercharge the energy transition across Africa’s sun-soaked landscapes, we’ve launched the Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund with an initial £60 million and an ambitious plan to grow it to £250 million over the next three years. From rooftop solar and battery storage to electric vehicle charging and smart grid upgrades, the fund will back projects that light up Sub-Saharan Africa.

A Different Approach to Investment

We want to do this right. That's why we're working with investors who share our mission and who understand that positive impact and investment go together. These include family offices, foundations, and individuals who care about building something meaningful alongside financial success.

We're also working with fund design experts to create more flexible investment structures than typical infrastructure funds, ensuring our approach works for both investors and the communities we're supporting.

Creating Opportunity, One Community at a Time

While our new Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund is our most ambitious leap in Africa yet, it’s far from the beginning of our journey there. In partnership with Idris Elba’s Akuna Group, we’re building Sierra Leone's first wind farm to bring clean, affordable energy to the area and kick-start a new wave of green economy,

Across Africa, brilliant minds are developing the next breakthrough energy technologies. To celebrate and support their innovation, we’ve launched the Africa Energy Entrepreneurship Awards in partnership with the King’s Sustainable Markets Initiative.

And we are also working with MOPO, a solar-powered battery company renting power-bank-style units on a pay-as-you-go basis, helping households and businesses unlock economic opportunities that were previously out of reach.

Global problems require global solutions

You might wonder what an African solar farm has to do with British energy customers. The answer is everything. Climate change doesn't respect borders. Every solar panel installed in Kenya reduces global carbon emissions. Every wind turbine in South Africa means one less coal plant needed anywhere else.

The global energy transition benefits everyone. By generating power where the sun shines brightest and the wind blows strongest, we can make the most of abundant renewable potential. This means driving down energy costs quickly while building a clean energy system that benefits all.

When we help power a hospital in Ghana or connect a school in Kenya to the grid, we're part of building a fairer, cleaner world. Africa's energy demand is expected to grow faster than anywhere on Earth. The choice we make now about how to power that growth will shape the climate for generations.

The Energy Revolution Goes Global

We've proven that renewable energy can be cheap, reliable, and popular. Our customers love our clean tariffs and innovative products. like The Collective, where people can invest in local wind and solar projects from £25.

Now we're scaling that success globally. Africa could become a clean energy superpower with its abundant sunshine, strong winds, and growing energy demand. Expanding access to renewable energy doesn’t just power homes; it powers opportunity. It enables entrepreneurs to thrive, businesses to grow, and communities to build sustainable prosperity for the future.

Our job as a global energy disruptor is to help local communities and investors make that happen.

Southern California Edison, Shell Energy North America, and others have agreed to buy electricity from the 500-megawatt–capacity project starting next year.
As of 2022, the US had almost 4,000 megawatts of installed geothermal energy, meaning Cape Station would be equivalent to around 12% of the country’s geothermal capacity.
Caveats Any fracking project comes with the risk of earthquakes—a hazard that has plagued previous geothermal efforts in South Korea and Switzerland.","By harnessing heat from deep below ground, Fervo promises 24/7 clean geothermal energy—potentially anywhere. The company uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs capable of delivering enough electricity to power massive data centers and hundreds of thousands of homes.

Some places on Earth hit the geological jackpot for generating electricity. In those spots, three conditions naturally align: high temperatures, plentiful water, and rock that’s permeable enough for fluids to circulate through.

Enhanced geothermal systems aim to replicate those conditions in far more places—producing a steady supply of renewable energy wherever they’re deployed. Fervo’s approach centers on two key techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry.

First, the company uses fracking, pumping high-pressure water to crack open the deep, hot rock. Second, in addition to drilling down, Fervo also drills sideways. This means Fervo can access more hot rock in each well.

Combining these strategies with special diamond drilling bits that rapidly chew through rock means Fervo can drill faster and cheaper than previously thought possible for geothermal. As a result, the cost of its electricity could be competitive with—or even more affordable than—other sources like coal or nuclear power.

Fervo has already shown that its technology can deliver power at commercial scale. In 2023, its Project Red in Nevada demonstrated its 3.5-megawatt capacity and began feeding electricity into the local grid that powers Google’s data centers.

Key indicators

Industry: Geothermal energy

Founded: 2017

Headquarters: Houston, Texas, US

Notable fact: In June, Fervo announced it had drilled its hottest and deepest well to date: a well plunging 15,765 feet deep and reaching 520 °F (271 °C).

Potential for impact

Geothermal plants provide low-emissions power and need less land to produce the same amount of electricity as other renewable energy sources and coal-fired power stations. And unlike weather-dependent wind and solar, geothermal can be a round-the-clock energy source for the grid. That could be a major benefit as AI and data centers push electricity demand higher across the US and around the world.

Fervo was featured on the 2023 edition of this list and has made steady progress since. In fact, it’s now building the world’s largest enhanced geothermal power plant, Cape Station, in southwestern Utah.

Southern California Edison, Shell Energy North America, and others have agreed to buy electricity from the 500-megawatt–capacity project starting next year. That’s enough energy to power more than 400,000 average-sized US homes. As of 2022, the US had almost 4,000 megawatts of installed geothermal energy, meaning Cape Station would be equivalent to around 12% of the country’s geothermal capacity.

Fervo also benefits from a rare political sweet spot: US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was one of Fervo’s early investors while at the energy services firm Liberty Energy, has listed geothermal as one of his top priorities.

Caveats

Any fracking project comes with the risk of earthquakes—a hazard that has plagued previous geothermal efforts in South Korea and Switzerland.

Fervo reduces that risk by fracking wells in smaller stages. This strategy, which involves pumping fluid into the rock in sections, reduces the risk of large fractures that can trigger significant seismic activity. Fervo also operates dozens of seismic monitors around its sites.

Lengthy review timelines could still slow the company’s progress. Planned expansions to the Cape Station project took about three years to go through the federal permitting process, and developments on federal land can take more than 10 years to get approval. Without streamlining, future projects may be subject to the same waiting game.

Next steps

The first phase of Fervo’s Cape Station in southern Utah is slated to go online in late 2026 and will be capable of generating 100 megawatts of electricity. A second phase will add another 400 megawatts of capacity in 2028.

Fervo says that it has already secured enough land in Utah to support up to 10 gigawatts of geothermal development.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fervo-Energy_Cape-Station_3.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 08:00:36.197056

The country’s clear and coherent approach, exemplified by the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, outlines a long-term commitment to significantly increasing the share of renewable and clean energy in its power mix to not only meet growing domestic demand but also to lead international climate action efforts.

The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 aims to triple the contribution of renewable energy and invest between AED150 to AED200 billion by 2030. This initiative targets increasing the installed clean energy capacity from 14.2 GW to nearly 19.8 GW by 2030, while also rising the clean energy share in the total energy mix to 30 percent by that date. The strategy is set against a backdrop of a rapidly growing economy and rising energy demand, balanced by a clear focus on environmental responsibility and economic sustainability. Key goals include reducing emissions from water and energy sectors to achieve net zero by 2050, eliminating clean coal from the energy mix, increasing energy consumption efficiency by 42 to 45 percent compared to 2019, and creating 50,000 new green jobs by 2030. Through this, the UAE plans substantial financial savings while fostering significant investments to sustain economic growth.

Expanding capacity and reducing carbon emissions

The leadership of the UAE under the wise guidance of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, is foundational in these accomplishments. With the declaration of 2023 as the Year of Sustainability under the theme ‘Today for Tomorrow,’ the UAE has reinforced its commitment to integrating sustainability principles across all sectors.

Flagship projects demonstrate the country’s commitment to clean energy and technological advancement. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, the world’s largest single-site solar park, is pivotal to the UAE’s renewable energy landscape. Scheduled to reach a capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030 with investments around AED50 billion, this massive solar park supplies clean energy to over half a million homes and significantly reduces carbon emissions. The park’s ongoing expansion in 2025, along with other solar projects nationwide, highlights the UAE’s relentless push to boost solar capacity by an additional 800 MW this year alone.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers.","LUBBOCK — Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill, along with a series of executive actions targeting climate and clean energy programs, are disrupting clean energy manufacturing, supply chains and deployment that had been surging this decade.

Notably, these actions include curtailing tax credits that had driven hundreds of billions of private dollars into clean technologies, making it more difficult to build new energy projects and stopping nearly completed projects in their tracks. These steps actually run directly counter to many of the Trump administration’s own economic and energy goals.

Instead of reducing electricity prices, the bill is projected to increase them by making the quickest-to-build and most affordable new power sources more expensive at a time of rising electricity demand. Instead of restoring America’s manufacturing base and supply chains, the slow deployment will undermine private investment into new clean tech factories planned across the country and their supply chains. And instead of positioning the U.S. to better compete in global industries, the bill effectively cedes key 21st century technologies such as batteries, electric vehicles and energy infrastructure to China.

While these issues have become unfortunate fodder in the culture wars, they were always economic. You can see that in the effort major businesses from across the U.S. economy made throughout 2025, as they pressed Congress to maintain clean energy incentives. And it’s why, amid rising energy prices and economic change, businesses should continue to advocate for clean energy policy that helps to meet energy demand and sustainably grow the economy. In this difficult political environment, climate and clean energy policy must focus on building up U.S. industry and innovation by advancing affordable, reliable, homegrown clean power.

For sustainability professionals, this is an opportunity to better align key corporate functions with policy priorities and help guide your company’s support through the rest of this Congress. Here are some key policy areas where companies should advocate.

Extend and simplify tax credits

Trump’s big bill takes sharp aim at wind and solar power, rapidly phasing out tax credits for these energy sources if they don’t start construction by next summer or aren’t up and running by the end of 2027. At the same time, the administration has imposed unreasonable restrictions on many wind and solar projects and changed qualification rules, making it harder for projects to get started in time to claim what remains of the tax credits.

These actions threaten to dramatically slow down deployment of wind and solar power — the most affordable and quickest-to-build energy sources — at a time when the nation needs all the energy it can get as quickly as possible to affordably meet surging demand.

Businesses should call on Congress to provide greater stability and a longer runway for wind and solar power. We need that affordable power to meet the increasing energy demand for data centers, artificial intelligence and new manufacturing facilities. Restoring the incentives will also support new manufacturing jobs as companies work to reshore supply chains to make these technologies in the U.S.

As the general public and lawmakers from both parties recognize the need for new power sources to prevent skyrocketing utility bills and investments shifting abroad, businesses can play a powerful role in advocating for extended incentives and cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate the build-out of solar and wind power.

Make American transportation cutting edge

Congress is due to renew its every-five-year transportation infrastructure funding in 2026 to strengthen the nation’s roads, bridges, railways and more. Not only is this an opportunity to fund critical projects and repairs, but it also presents an opportunity to fully modernize U.S. infrastructure and the transportation systems that companies across the economy depend upon.

Businesses should call for this legislation to support jobs and innovation in industrial materials that are central to our infrastructure such as asphalt, concrete and steel. Incentives for cleaner industrial processes will further support investment and jobs that are already taking root across the country, positioning the U.S. to lead the world in building materials that are in growing global demand.

It is also a timely opportunity for companies that want greater access to electric vehicles to advocate for policies that expand access to them, and for the U.S. auto industry to secure policies that help it compete in a changing global economy. New investment in mining, processing and refining critical minerals would shape domestic supply chains for batteries, while further deployment of charging infrastructure would support wider-spread adoption of the innovative and cost-saving vehicles they are building.

Meet the economic moment with smart permitting

Red tape holds up investment, so meeting the nation’s surging energy demand and supporting domestic manufacturing will require smart policy changes that make it faster and easier to build. Businesses especially need new transmission infrastructure to reliably deliver affordable power, and the U.S. must also find ways to responsibly source our growing need for critical minerals. In each case, it will take reforms that make it more efficient to secure permits and increase certainty for businesses and investors as they take these projects on.

Bipartisan momentum for federal permitting reform has grown in recent years. While negotiations fell short in the last Congress, the need has only increased. Republicans and Democrats have a real opportunity to negotiate responsible reforms that support homegrown clean power and advanced manufacturing to meet the nation’s energy, economic, and national security needs. Businesses are well-suited and well-positioned to help bridge the political divide and make the economic case for action.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trellis_editorial_clean_energy_1470x894.png,N,,2025-10-06 06:59:38.628712

A new report by Penn State researchers offers a brilliant, equitable solution: turning streetlights into charging stations. The idea has the potential to change the way cities extend electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure—faster, cheaper, and more equitably.

Power Where It’s Needed Most

For most people, public charging will be the sole true public choice. For apartment dwellers and condo residents, home charging is not an option. Without a garage or driveway space, overnight charging is nearly a luxury. That’s a tremendous barrier to EV adoption, even as sales continue to grow. By 2040, electric vehicles are projected to represent 11% to 28% of all vehicles on the road. But if charging is not as convenient as parking, that growth could make entire neighborhoods obsolete.

“Most apartment and multi-unit building residents, especially in urban and downtown settings, do not have access to special home EV chargers,” said Xianbiao “XB” Hu, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State. “Luckily, the streetlight pole is already energized and usually municipally owned, so working with them is pretty straightforward.”

Streetlights already line streets where cars park. They’re connected to the electrical grid and publicly owned, meaning that cities can upgrade them without expensive trenching or construction. By placing charging equipment on existing poles, you can construct curbside charging that’s both practical and fair—providing clean transportation to those who’ve been left behind in the EV revolution.

Building a Real-World Test

To make the shift from theory to practice, Penn State partnered with Recharge Kansas City, an alliance of the City of Kansas City, the Metropolitan Energy Center, a nonprofit institution, local utility Evergy, and the U.S. Department of Energy. They built and pilot-tested 23 street lighting charging stations along Kansas City, Missouri. They selected each site using a three-part framework that emphasized demand, technical feasibility, and social equity.

The research, which appeared in the Journal of Urban Planning and Development under the American Society of Civil Engineers, monitored performance for a year, between January and December 2023. Scientists were curious to know how the streetlight chargers compared with the old ones in terms of speed, expense, and environmental advantage.

According to the findings, the new plan bettered expectations even more. The updated streetlights charged faster, cost less to install, and helped lower emissions by minimizing gasoline usage. Because they drew power directly from city power lines, these chargers also saw less competition from multiple users, compared to busy commercial locations.

Smart Data Meets Street Smarts

To find where chargers should be sited, the research team developed a two-tiered siting model that combined artificial intelligence and local knowledge. They first worked with six years of data from 455 installed charging points in Kansas City to train a predictive model that forecasted weekly charging demand. The model considered factors like traffic flow, land use, trip generation, and the number of nearby points of interest—everything from grocery stores to apartment complexes.

Next was the equity layer. The community sought to see chargers not just go where they’d be busiest, but also where they’d be most needed. “We thought about equity, in this case, as proactive engagement with the community to offer just and equitable access to the streetlight charging advantages,” said co-author Yang “Chris” Song, a former Penn State doctoral student who now works as a data scientist for ElectroTempo.

After merging the data with on-the-ground surveys, they chose the 23 most optimal sites—those that were in balance between expected demand and access to underserved neighborhoods. The installations that arrived at the final stage underwent safety inspections, engineering approvals, and regulatory testing to guarantee dependable operation.

Why Streetlights Make Sense

Retrofitting streetlights is very cost-effective. Because the poles are already installed and energized, installation is inexpensive relative to building new stand-alone stations. Municipalities also save time and public money from digging sidewalks or adding new electrical conduits.

Local control is also a plus. Cities can map charger networks based on public goals—lowering emissions, supporting local business, or increasing neighborhood convenience—without lengthy negotiations with individual property owners. That control simplifies scaling and makes it easier to balance equity with efficiency.

And since streetlights are near daily destinations, charging can easily be integrated into the daily routine. As your car charges, you can stop to shop, dine, or catch up with friends nearby. The effect is a system that doesn’t feel like “refueling” at all, but rather like an ordinary aspect of city life.

Proving It Works

Once chargers were in place, the research team measured performance against that of normal charging stations. The researchers used a statistical test called the Mann–Whitney U test to confirm whether any differences in reliability and speed were real. The analysis found no significant performance differences—proving streetlight chargers can match standard stations for efficiency while being less expensive and available to more people.

The pilot, lasting one year, also revealed valuable insights on user behavior. Because the chargers were accessible and visible, on the curb and handily within reach, drivers made consistent and frequent use of them.

The researchers tied that convenience to measurable gasoline savings and lowered greenhouse gas emissions. With the passage of time, those benefits could be an important factor in helping cities achieve climate goals.

A New Model for Urban EV Access

Most prior research on charger placement attempted to maximize utilization or minimize travel distances—good goals, but ones that tend not to prioritize social equity. The Kansas City pilot broke new ground by marrying advanced data modeling with a strong focus on equity.

“We wanted a model that cities could quickly adopt,” Song said. “Scalability was the largest factor in why this matters. It’s not only for Kansas City—it’s for cities in general.”

Other researchers participating in the project included postdoctoral fellows Yuyan “Annie” Pan and Tianjia Yang, and doctoral student Yuxin Ding. Through their collaboration, they created a scalable, reproducible model for cities to expand EV availability without burdensome infrastructure costs.

The success of the initiative proves that cities do not need to start from square one to build a fair and effective EV network. They merely need to look up—to the streetlights that already illuminate the streets.

Practical Implications of the Research

Converting streetlights to electric vehicle charging stations can rewire the approach to public infrastructure in cities. Recycling infrastructure is cost-effective, speeds up deployment, and brings charging to everyone — renters to multifamily dwellers.

This approach also encourages cleaner air and lower emissions, particularly for city communities most affected by car pollution.

Implemented broadly, streetlight charging can make going electric more just and sustainable, turning a humble utility into a climate action and economic justice force.

So far, it’s not working out that way.

Nationwide, that push by Silicon Valley is gobbling up energy, increasing average customers’ electricity bills and threatening progress on decarbonization. In Virginia, data-center developers warned the utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.

Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses both here and beyond the Mid-Atlantic state.

Virginia’s legislators certainly took notice. At least 33 unique bills were introduced in the last session to address various data-center dilemmas, an Inside Climate News analysis found.

“We are practically providing data centers for the entire world and I don’t want that cost to be borne by ratepayers in my district,” said state Del. Shelly Simonds, a Democrat representing the port city of Newport News.

But almost all of the bills ran aground, meeting cumulative resistance from tech businesses, local governments, labor unions and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Of the four that made it into law, only two were more than a symbolic measure.

The data-center growth spurt was already putting pressure on the state’s power supplies before this year. Virginia overtook California, the most populous state, in 2023 to emerge as the top importer of electricity, driven by rapid growth in commercial power consumption.

That means the impact of Virginia’s data-center decisions extends to the wider region. It shares an interconnected grid with much of the Mid-Atlantic, and that grid’s operator is increasingly under pressure from state governors as costs spike.

“Virginia cannot produce the amount of power needed for the data centers, so we’re going to have to pipe in power from neighboring states. And if Maryland is enhancing its grid and building infrastructure, then odds are Marylanders are going to be paying for that when the power is coming here,” said Del. Ian Lovejoy, who sponsored four data-center bills last session, none of which passed.

The skyrocketing power demand is also creating hurdles for the state’s ambitions to completely wean its two largest electric utilities off planet-warming fossil fuels in the next few decades. Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.

As a result, “the rapid growth of data centers [has] surpassed all environmental issues in Virginia practically, so it’s something that demands our attention,” Simonds said.

But the failure last session of nearly all 33 bills on the subject, most without even getting a hearing, underscores the challenge of legislating on data centers in a state home to the greatest number of them.

Legislative roadblocks

The most ambitious of the five data-center bills that the Virginia General Assembly passed was vetoed by Youngkin.

That bill would have required jurisdictions considering a data-center proposal to mandate a noise study if the site is close to homes and schools, and to review with the local utility any electric substation upgrades that would be needed.

The majority of bills, 22, never even made it out of committee. That’s the stage where a bill must get approval from a smaller group of legislators before it advances to the full chamber.

Some of the bills had bipartisan backing. But interviews with a dozen state lawmakers pointed to a range of hurdles—chief among them a muscular lobbying effort by tech companies as well as the fraught politics of treading on the decision-making domain of local officials.

Nineteen of the 33 bills were primarily sponsored by Democrats, while Republicans were the primary sponsors of the other 14. Geography, rather than politics, helps explain who pushed for change.

“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy. The Republican’s district covers part of Prince William County where a local rezoning fight is unfolding over an upcoming 1,700-acre data center corridor.

“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.

The legislative proposals covered a variety of issues: improving transparency, reforming tax incentives, protecting ratepayers, increasing state oversight and overhauling data-center siting and zoning.

Two bills that would have required data centers to disclose their often-massive water and power usage died in committee. Another seven bills that sought to change the tax incentives for data centers—some by requiring clean energy use, higher energy-efficiency or wage minimums—also all died in committee.

A handful of bills sought to explicitly protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of infrastructure that will be built to accommodate data-center growth. Under the current system, everyone pays. Two of those measures got merged, and variants passed in the House and the Senate. But the chambers could not resolve the differences.

One ratepayer-protection measure did make it into law, and it’s a meaningful change—but only for the roughly 700,000 customers served by the state’s nonprofit electric co-operatives, a fraction of the total customer base in Virginia. The new law creates a path for the co-ops to create an affiliate to serve large electricity users in order to reduce their impact on average ratepayers.

Of three bills attempting to increase state oversight, one became law—after an amendment wiped out nearly all the extra oversight it would have brought.

The original version would have required electric utilities to create a separate classification for data-center customers. The enacted version requires the state utility regulator to exercise authority it already has: to determine whether existing customer classifications are reasonable when considering rate increase requests from Dominion or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s biggest electric utilities.

Dominion now has a rate case before that regulator, the State Corporation Commission, with the powerful utility and big tech companies squabbling over what fair rates for data centers should be.

“The issue is none of this stuff has enough teeth,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, a Prince William County Democrat who voted for the weakened bill and had sponsored one of her own that stalled. “What ultimately got passed was a significantly watered-down version.”

Del. Irene Shin, a Fairfax County Democrat, proposed the bill about the State Corporation Commission. She thinks the law it became sends “a clear signal to the SCC with what the General Assembly wants them to do.”

Those wants include “safeguards that protect ratepayers like your normal, average Virginia family, and prioritize their protections over what the big corporations need,” Shin said, “because we’re talking about billion-dollar corporations, multi-billion-dollar corporations that can absolutely afford to pay the cost of getting the energy that they need.”

Her region is taking a hit from the Trump administration’s big cutbacks to federal employment, and she’s worried about further economic consequences to residents from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Adding the proposed increase to Dominion customers of about $20 every month for typical households starting next year, she said, is “insane.”

Del. David Reid, a Democrat who represents part of Loudoun County, sponsored two of the four data-center bills that made it to the finish line.

The first offers an incentive for large electricity users to install battery storage.

He also sponsored legislation to build transmission lines with advanced conductor technology to deliver power more efficiently. What ultimately made it into law was diluted from a requirement to a suggestion: to “consider the prudency of using advanced conductors.”

“I was probably trying to accomplish much more in the earlier version, and then you get to the point where it’s like, OK, we can all agree to this this year,” Reid said, pointing to varying perspectives that crop up during the session. “The process works. It’s just that sometimes, in Virginia, it doesn’t work very fast.”

Over a dozen bills, more than for any other data-center issue, would have changed how localities handle siting and zoning for the facilities. None of them made it through.

One was vetoed. Another was voted down by the Senate. Two were turned down in committee, and the rest languished and expired without making it even that far.

The bill vetoed by Youngkin, which would have required a noise study and information about substation needs from data centers, had been more ambitious in an earlier iteration. Initially, the measure would have required details on the electricity generation within a locality that would serve any proposed data centers.

“The bill that we started with, that I wanted, does not look very much like the one that passed,” said Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat representing parts of Prince William County, who sponsored the measure in the House.

In his explanation for vetoing it, Youngkin said the bill “limits local discretion and creates unnecessary red tape” and warned it “could chill investment and hinder economic development.”

“Do we need to make sure that citizen voices are heard? Yes,” the governor said afterward at an event announcing a $9 billion investment from Google. “Do we need to make sure that local leaders are empowered to make decisions about where they go? Yes. Should that be decided in Richmond? Absolutely not.”

Thomas said his constituents are frustrated about seemingly inexplicable siting decisions being made locally, and they wanted state intervention.

“The current Republican administration in Virginia has made it very clear that they are unabashedly and, at times, irrationally pro-data center,” Thomas said. “Why we would continuously build industrial sites that have diesel generators on top by schools is beyond me but yet the industry keeps pushing to have that happen.”

Following the money

The downfall of data-center legislation in Virginia speaks, in more ways than one, to the role of money in politics, advocates and state lawmakers told Inside Climate News. The state is among the minority of states that set no contribution limits on campaign finance.

“Nobody’s immune to taking a lot of money,” said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group.

Dominion, which opposed two of the data-center bills, is the top political donor in the state. The company contributed more than $13 million to both parties from 2024 through Aug. 31, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Powerful Silicon Valley giants have also poured money into the state in recent years, through the Data Center Coalition—which testified against many of the 33 bills—and associated political action committees.

The Data Center Coalition and Dominion Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

“Anything that makes it more difficult to lubricate the wheels of commerce from data-center development that people are making a lot of money off of is going to be met with the typical sorts of issues in subcommittees where some of these bills go to die,” Kapoor said.

Another source of pressure: localities that reap the financial benefits of this data-center growth.

“We essentially have inadvertently created a monstrous money-making machine for local governments,” said Simonds, the Newport News delegate. “A huge number of cities and localities across Virginia are lining up to have a data center because of the tax revenue.”

Loudoun County, for instance, collected $733 million, almost a third of its total tax revenue, from data centers in the 2023 fiscal year. That kind of revenue allows local governments to avoid taking the unpopular step of raising real estate taxes.

“There’s a lot of folks in rural parts of the state, we’re all for data centers,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the Republican House minority leader representing parts of several counties in Southwest Virginia, an area that has struggled to recover from the downturn of coal.

The political cost for state lawmakers to be seen as stepping on the authority of localities is especially high during a big election year. Virginia, with a Democratically controlled Senate not up for election until 2027, will vote on a new governor and all 100 House of Delegate members in November.

“The General Assembly doesn’t like to get involved in local siting issues because they don’t want to open that can of worms, so to speak,” said Lovejoy, the Prince William County delegate.

The result is an uncoordinated system in which local decisions about data centers create fallout for the power grid that will affect everyone’s pocketbook if the state doesn’t intervene.

“It’s like an orchestra where you’ve got certain instruments playing loud and unwieldy and then you’ve got other areas where they’re not playing at all,” Simonds said. “We need somebody to be the conductor of this orchestra.”

There’s also an unlikely political alliance at play.

“You have businesses and unions agreeing on something. And that doesn’t happen that often. But it’s happening over data centers,” Lovejoy said.

The support of organized labor is largely coming from the construction trades and electrical workers’ unions. In Virginia, data centers support an estimated 74,000 jobs and generate $5.5 billion in labor income, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

Most of these jobs, however, don’t last beyond the construction stage. And “there are other unions that might be really concerned with what’s going on,” said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that seeks to hold companies and governments accountable on economic growth.

“For example, public sector unions might be concerned that the states are losing revenue and there’s less money” to hire teachers and firefighters, she said. Virginia forgoes close to $1 billion in yearly revenue over its tax exemptions to attract data centers.

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership contended there’s a 14 percent average annual local and state tax return on the exemption incentive for the years 2022 through 2027. But there’s spirited debate across the country about whether states dangling incentives would get this development either way. And that return on investment figure doesn’t account for the extra power costs.

Economic overdependence on data centers might also prompt companies with job-intensive investments to look elsewhere with more available power supplies, Tarczynska added.

Climate and costs

The huge increase in expected demand for power is throwing a wrench in the state’s progress toward fulfilling its legal mandate of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. The General Assembly set that target in the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020.

“You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” said Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat whose district encompasses parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties. “You can’t continue to not regulate and to sign off on these massive data centers, each one of which often requires more power than your average city, and simultaneously say, ‘OK, we’re going to get to 100 percent clean energy on this deadline.’”

Del. Rip Sullivan, a Fairfax County Democrat, was the primary sponsor of that clean-energy law in the House. He thinks all is not lost.

“I’m not blind to the fact that it makes the road steeper, makes the challenge harder,” he said. But “if we were to put as much energy—pardon the pun—political energy into accelerating the Clean Economy Act as some opponents that you see are putting into trying to kill it, if we put all that energy into trying to improve it and meet those goals, I have every confidence we could meet them.”

One of his bills this year, which made it through the legislature but was vetoed by the governor, would have set targets for how much energy storage capacity utilities must build or buy in the next couple of decades. If enacted, it would have been a market signal for energy storage companies to come to Virginia, he said.

Ratings from the regional grid operator show solar’s effective load carrying capacity, its ability to produce energy when it’s most needed, is as low as 33 percent without storage but as high as 75 percent when paired with it.

Asked for his views on battery storage, Youngkin cited the costs of the technology, supply chains dominated by China and “great alternatives” that are available.

“If people want to invest in battery storage, God bless them. All of the above—we need everything. But to mandate what the answer is based on misinformed facts, I firmly believe is a mistake,” Youngkin said.

Meanwhile, the way that electricity rates are set by utilities and approved by state regulators is putting a disproportionate burden on households and businesses.

“We are effectively seeing customers across the Mid-Atlantic subsidizing the electrical infrastructure that’s needed for Northern Virginia’s data centers,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a global think tank with a mission to accelerate the energy transition.

Multiple state lawmakers spoke of their constituents’ electric bills while explaining their motivations for sponsoring data-center legislation.

“You have certain counties getting rich and then in other places, like my city of Newport News, I have constituents hopping mad about their energy bills going up,” Simonds said.

Thomas, the Prince William County delegate, was also concerned about declining property values. “Residents who were living in an area first, and then a data center was built later, had pretty much lost their largest wealth-building tool, which is their home value that’s plummeted because now there’s an industrial building a hundred feet from their back deck,” he said.

Legislators hoping to raise oversight to shield their constituents aren’t giving up. Sen. Danica Roem, a Prince William County Democrat, said her work for the next session can begin with the 13 Senate members who voted for a water-protection bill introduced by Sen. Richard Stuart, a Republican who represents parts of the Middle Peninsula northeast of Richmond. They just need eight more votes to get the bill out of the Senate.

“I need to bring in four more Democrats. Richard needs to bring four more Republicans,” Roem said.

House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and Senate Democrat majority leadership did not respond to requests for comment.

Ultimately, voters can influence what happens next.

“The pushback has to come from the ground and it has to come from the people,” Piedmont Environmental Council’s Kapoor said. “The more these legislators, whether they’re rural or urban, feel the pushback from their constituents, those [proposed bills] will have increasing resonance.”

From Sullivan’s perspective, it’s not too late for Virginia to chart a nation-leading course that avoids sticking residents with the tab for data centers, from their electric bills to the climate consequences.

“This is an immense challenge, and it is going to take a concerted effort to meet that challenge,” he said, “but the difficulty of the challenge should only embolden us rather than cause us to give up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_6367-1024x6831759742649.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=FfJat6wE,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:38.981613

On Thursday, October 2, PT SMI visited Ijen Geothermal Power Plant in Bondowoso Regency, East Java. President Director of PT SMI, Reynaldi Hermansjah, observed the operation of Ijen Geothermal Power Plant which delivers benefits to the community in the electricity sector. During this site visit, Reynaldi was also accompanied by the Head of the Corporate Secretary Division of PT SMI, Ramona Harimurti, Team Leader of the Sustainable Financing Division, Teddy Wardiana, as well as the Director & Chief Financial Officer of PT Medco Energi Internasional Tbk, Anthony R. Mathias, and the Director and Chief Financial Officer of PT Medco Power Indonesia, Myrta Sri Utami.

PT SMI finances the development of Ijen Geothermal Power Plant amounting to USD 144.9 million, or approximately IDR 2.35 trillion, equivalent to 65% of the total project value. In addition, PT SMI also supports strengthening cross-sector collaboration, including partnerships with international institutions such as the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) through a blended finance scheme via SDG Indonesia One (SIO) platform. Besides AFD, other international donor institutions supporting this project are the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and USAID SINAR, which both provide technical assistance.

PT SMI appreciates the mutual collaboration among all parties. ""The Ijen Geothermal Power Plant project is a real example of synergy between development financing and a commitment to environmental preservation. We at PT SMI are always open to collaborate with various parties, including - in this project - with Medco, and also international partners like AFD (Agence Française de Développement). We hope this strategic step will support the achievement of the government's Asta Cita, especially in the New and Renewable Energy sector,"" said Reynaldi.

Ijen Geothermal Power Plant was recently inaugurated by President Prabowo Subianto on June 26, 2025. This geothermal power plant is one of the strategic projects in the development of New and Renewable Energy in Indonesia. With an initial capacity of 35 Megawatts (MW), Ijen Geothermal Power Plant can support the Java-Bali Electricity System, benefiting over 80,000 households. The operation of Ijen Geothermal Power Plant supports the government's target to increase renewable energy mix from 9% to 23% by 2025, in accordance with the National Medium-Term Development Plan. Additionally, it aligns with Indonesia's goal of achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2060 or sooner, and with global commitments to address climate change. The operation of the jen Geothermal Power Plant has potentially contributing to avoid greenhouse gas emissions of 228,636 to 838,332 tCO₂e/year.

PT SMI's commitment for environmental sustainability is also demonstrated through its Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (TJSL) program. On Friday, October 3, PT SMI also visited ""Omah Tukik"" turtle conservation facility at Cemara Beach, Banyuwangi Regency. On that occasion, PT SMI and the local community also released 40 turtle hatchlings into the open sea. Through this program, PT SMI assists in the construction of sea turtle hatcheries, the revitalization of patrol boats, and the provision of maritime safety equipment. The results are evident in the hatching rate, which exceeds 90 percent, with 1,200 hatchlings released annually. This program also creates livelihood including tour guides, operators, and conservation site managers. A total of 500 local residents are also involved in various activities, from facility construction and marine safety training to education and sea turtle release, and community empowerment for vendors at the conservation site.

""Turtles are one of the important elements in maintaining the ecosystem and biodiversity. This is where PT SMI comes in to help with environmental conservation on the coast of Banyuwangi, through our TJSL program. Besides that, we also hope to increase local community welfare through this program,"" said Reynaldi.

Ijen Geothermal Power Plant project and Omah Tukik TJSL program reflect the Company's grand vision for building a sustainable Indonesia, where infrastructure progress, environmental preservation, and community welfare go hand in hand. PT SMI emphasizes that future development must be inclusive, environmentally friendly, and long-term oriented.

Some moves, like a rare state tax hike, are getting lots of attention and likely to face a legal challenge from the marijuana industry. Others are still coming to the surface as the package is analyzed ahead of its expected approval by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. She could sign some or all of it before a one-week interim spending law expires late Wednesday.

Following are some more under-the-radar facets of the budget and transportation deal:

The Republican-led House demanded and secured reforms to the legislative process of awarding earmarks to specific entities. It also scaled back funding for such “pork” grants, which surged amid COVID-19 pandemic-related surpluses.

Many earmarks are not necessarily controversial. They go to things like bridge repairs and police equipment.

But the typically secretive, 11th-hour process has drawn scrutiny because there has been little or no evaluation or vetting of the projects in public before they are announced. Some grants to nonprofits tied to politically connected developers and businesspeople have led to criminal investigations.

New transparency rules for earmarks were adopted by the House, which held hearings on earmark requests. The Democratic-controlled Senate eventually backed similar rules last week. They are expected to be codified into law.

A bill pending on Whitmer’s desk has $148 million for new “legislatively directed spending items” across this fiscal year and last. That is down from $335 million in grants awarded in 2024, $769 million in 2023 and $1 billion in 2022.

It can be difficult to define and tally earmarks. For instance, the budget designates $250 million for Michigan State University to expand a prenatal and infant cash program, but the money will ultimately go to pregnant and new moms.

“We significantly cut the pork, and none of you can dispute that,” Republican House Speaker Matt Hall told reporters. “That was a big priority of mine.”

New permanent funding for roads and bridges is the linchpin — and main headline — of the agreement. It will total $1.5 billion in the first calendar year and gradually rise to nearly $1.9 billion by the end of the decade, more than making up for the impending loss of money generated by a short-term bonding program for state highways.

What is less publicized is that legislators upended how a portion of the new funds (and $600 million in existing funding) will be distributed, designating more to local road agencies and less to the state than under the traditional formula.

The New Neighborhood Roads Fund will get $1.1 billion initially and $1.4 billion annually down the line. Of that:

$100 million will be used to repair closed, restricted and critical local bridges.

$40 million will fund grade-separation grants to help local governments move roads above or below congested railroad crossings.

$35 million will be sent to local transit agencies and other public transportation purposes.

$65 million will go to a new Infrastructure Projects Authority Fund. The Michigan Department of Transportation will issue grants to “infrastructure mobility projects” — things like mass transit, including passenger rail — with priority given to projects that need money for federal matching dollars. The funding could spur movement in Metro Detroit, where business leaders say inadequate public transportation is holding the region back.

Rep. Jason Morgan, D-Ann Arbor, estimated the total for public transit is $160 million because it will also receive some $60 million from removing the sales tax on fuel and replacing it with higher gasoline and diesel taxes.

This is going to be the largest investment in public transit, probably in my lifetime, if not ever,” Morgan said, saying it will go to buses, rail and rural transportation. “This is going to be transformational for Michigan.”

Democrats successfully advocated to greatly grow Rx Kids, which provides pregnant moms $1,500 along with $500 a month during the baby’s first months of life. MSU, which will contract with service providers, will get $250 million over four years.

It was not immediately clear if that is enough to expand the program statewide, though that is what some Senate Democrats had called for in March.

The public-private partnership is funded by governments and foundations. It was launched in Flint and is now also in Kalamazoo, the eastern Upper Peninsula, Clare County and three communities in Oakland County — Pontiac, Royal Oak Township and Hazel Park.

""Rx Kids is a prescription for health, hope and opportunity,"" Dr. Mona Hanna, founding director of the MSU-Hurley Children’s Hospital Pediatric Public Health Initiative, said earlier this year.

Lawmakers freed up the $250 million by stopping a planned $500 million deposit into the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which Whitmer’s administration has utilized in incentive packages to land electric vehicle battery factories and other business projects.

Hospitals and insurance companies secured wins when legislators moved to, as some called it, ""save Medicaid,"" the government health care program that faces funding uncertainty in part due to new federal limits on provider taxes.

The budget authorizes the state to spend up to $9.3 billion from two Medicaid taxes and federal matching funds if revenues are available.

One of the levies, on health insurers and managed care organizations, is highly unlikely to pass muster under President Donald Trump's tax law and pending federal rules. The question is how much time Michigan has to replace the multi-tiered tax that, if not replaced, could lead to cuts in Medicaid, which covers one in four residents.

A bill sent to Whitmer empowers the state Department of Health and Human Services to work with the federal government to replace the Insurance Provider Assessment without needing legislative approval for the new tax.

Sen. Jonathan Lindsey, R-Coldwater, said it ""is an admirable attempt to solve a very real problem,"" but letting the department ""entirely rewrite a tax structure"" is ""a terrible amount of power to give to the department. What’s even worse is that currently it gives them that power in perpetuity.""

But Dominick Pallone, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, whose members contract with the state to provide Medicaid coverage, credited lawmakers for affording the executive branch broad taxing authorities to support Medicaid.

""However, with great power comes great responsibility,"" he said. ""We urge executive leaders to exercise patience and due diligence by not administering any immediate changes to the IPA that would come at the expense of commercial health insurance. We also call upon Republicans and Democrats to work in the same bipartisan fashion they have demonstrated in this budget agreement to support our call to federal leaders to allow Michigan a three-year transition period to change our current IPA to avoid increasing premiums on employers and employees.""

Hall said the issue was one of the most important parts of the budget talks for Democrats. Negotiators, he said, balanced that the tax has not yet been deemed to be noncompliant but could be at any time, putting the state in a bind if it is not given time to adjust.

""We basically depoliticized that issue. I'm really glad that we did that. People count on Medicaid. They count on their health care to be there,"" said Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn.

In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.
Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.
Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.","The Trump administration’s plan to revoke a key finding that certain greenhouse gases pose a risk to human health removes one of the most potent tools for emissions regulation from the last two decades, according to former EPA air office leadership.

The proposal to nix the 2009 endangerment finding is on a fast-track for finalization, and former leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency say it will claw back US climate progress and create a vacuum of strong GHG regulations.

“The political leadership is essentially performing a lobotomy on itself,” according to Joe Goffman, who led the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden. “The surgery began when they essentially shed all of the climate staff in the last couple of months.”

Three former EPA Administrators—William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman, and Gina McCarthy—wrote to current Administrator Lee Zeldin Sept. 22, expressing opposition to the endangerment proposal and urging him to “follow the law, the science, and EPA’s mission” by withdrawing the revocation plan.

Following through with the plan, in combination with the agency’s decision to end greenhouse gas reporting requirements, jeopardizes emissions enforcement under the Clean Air Act, Whitman said in an interview with Bloomberg Law.

“The whole point behind all of this is to stop regulating, the irony that’s lost on most people, that we are banning Tylenol, but we don’t seem to care about air pollution,” Whitman said, referencing unproven claims from the Trump administration about the alleged dangers of the pain and fever reducer.

Questioning the Science

President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.

The EPA is also looking to cut its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which would end agency insight into how much GHG pollution is coming from large emitters across the country.

In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.

Supporters of Trump’s plan to kill the finding this time around echo some of the justifications used in unsuccessful petitions of the past, namely that the finding puts undue regulatory pressure on industry and is based on faulty or incomplete scientific record.

The proposal itself relies heavily on a Department of Energy report that casts doubt on the extensive scientific record on climate change, claiming that carbon-induced warming “might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial.”

Creating Uncertainty

Staff who served during the agency’s early climate work in the late 90s and early 2000s fought for the type of change the endangerment finding eventually brought to the EPA’s air rulemaking regime, and see major backsliding on climate mitigation without such a crucial tool.

Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.

But those efforts “were not getting the kind of emissions reductions that science was clearly showing would be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes and smoke stacks,” Symons said.

The revocation proposal is currently just past its public comment period, and working its way to finalization. Once final, legal challenges are all but inevitable, which many clean air experts say hurts industry as much as public health with prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.

“It’s the worst case scenario for our safety,” he said. “It’s the worst case scenario for business, because the one thing that hurts everybody is having this chaotic wrecking ball approach that nobody thinks will stand up over the long term.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/9eece9d/2147483647/crop/5996x2311+0+177/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fc4%2F72754f4d49ad98904a2e0d6fb29e%2Fdec3-smog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 07:00:51.092410

A potential climate solution hits the ski trails at Jay Peak,"Abagael Giles, www.vermontpublic.org, abagael-giles",,,,,https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-10-06/goats-ski-trails-potential-climate-solution-slopes-jay-peak,"Every fall, ski areas across Vermont have to brush hog and weed whack their slopes to clear them of shrubs and grass for ski season.
On a recent afternoon, about 150 animals were making short work of grazing Jay Peak’s Interstate trail.
Jay Peak has about 350 acres of ski trails that all have to be mowed annually, says Andy Stenger, director of mountain operations.
“And it didn't take a lot of convincing for us to hop on board with it.” Grazing ski trails isn’t a new idea.
Stenger, with Jay Peak, says grazing is slower than mowing, but he’s keeping an open mind.","Every fall, ski areas across Vermont have to brush hog and weed whack their slopes to clear them of shrubs and grass for ski season. Now, some mountains are experimenting with a different kind of mower: goats and sheep.

On a recent afternoon, about 150 animals were making short work of grazing Jay Peak’s Interstate trail.

“The goats are great at the trees and the goldenrod and the other types of brush, but the sheep really do well with the grasses,” says farmer Adam Ricci of Barnet. “So by mixing the two together, we get everything covered pretty well.”

Ricci’s goats and sheep are outfitted with special solar-powered collars that use GPS trackers.

Instead of using traditional electric fencing, he draws a boundary map on his phone that he calls a “virtual paddock.”

This lets him move the animals multiple times a day, so they can cover more ground and don’t over-graze. It’s also less labor intensive than keeping them contained with traditional electric fencing.

Ricci’s herding dog also plays a critical role in helping to move the goats and protecting them from predation on the mountain.

“We also have Helios, the guardian dog,” he says. “He spends his time with the flock.”

If the animals stray too far, they get an audible warning that starts as an unpleasant ringing sound.

After a few warnings, wayward sheep and goats get what Adam says is a light shock, similar to that delivered by an electric fence collar for a dog.

He says this doesn’t happen very often, partly because he spends time training the flock to the collars with the visual aid of traditional fencing before putting them in the virtual paddock.

He says it’s a pretty good deal — the goats and sheep get to munch on grasses, but also knotweed and small trees like willow and maple. And Adam gets a place to graze them and a bit of extra income for his small farm.

Jay Peak has about 350 acres of ski trails that all have to be mowed annually, says Andy Stenger, director of mountain operations.

Doing it is expensive and uses a lot of diesel. The mountain is hoping the goats will be an environmentally friendly way to burn less fossil fuels.

So far, he’s been happy with the results, and there are obvious branding benefits.

“It’s good for the environment,” Stenger says. “And it didn't take a lot of convincing for us to hop on board with it.”

Grazing ski trails isn’t a new idea. It’s been tried before, but rotating animals frequently in steep terrain is labor intensive and traditional netting doesn’t always work well on steep and rocky trails.

These collars aren’t cheap — they cost about $200 apiece. A state grant for roughly $150,000 is helping farmers test them out on loan. They've been used to help goats remove knotweed, graze power lines and more.

Private donations have helped them test the technology at ski areas, and so far they’ve also been tried at Magic Mountain in Londonderry.

Dan Smith is with the Agritech Institute for Small Farms, which is lending Ricci the collars for the season.

“We're trying them out for vegetation management on utility lines in place of mechanized brush hogging and weed whacking,” he says of the state grant.

As for the environmental benefits, grazing does use less fossil fuels than mowing. But when it comes to the climate, that’s where the math starts to get a little more complicated.

Meredith Niles is a researcher at the University of Vermont who studies this.

“It’s not an easy apples to apples comparison,” she says of swapping goats for mowers. “We have to think about all kinds of greenhouse gas emissions if we're talking about climate change.”

Niles says goats and sheep produce methane, a super potent climate warming greenhouse gas. It mostly gets released when they burp or fart.

However, she says, so long as projects like this one don’t add a lot more animals to the landscape, it’s likely they’re reducing emissions.

When it comes to managing vegetation outside of ski areas, Niles says goats and sheep are particularly good options from a climate perspective because they produce about 1/15th the amount of methane that dairy cows do, and they compact the soil less, provided they are rotated frequently.

Niles says in Vermont, grazable land can be hard to come by for farms. “So I think this is a really interesting, innovative solution.”

Back on the slopes, Ricci says there’s no terrain at Jay Peak that’s too steep for his goats to graze, and he’s thinking about buying the collars at the end of the season.

Stenger, with Jay Peak, says grazing is slower than mowing, but he’s keeping an open mind.

“The total acreage that we were hoping to hit through this, we're probably not going to hit it,” he says. “But if we pursue it again in the future, we’ll have learned from this.”

If the pilot proves successful, the virtual paddock technology could allow grazing in all sorts of places that are mowed now, like under power lines and solar arrays — a sweet deal for local farmers in need of pasture and for the climate.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a58c19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5184x2722+0+345/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F23%2F15d1c815414583e92afb421f04e4%2Fgoats-graze-ski-trail-jay-peak-vermontpublic-giles-20250926.JPG,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:19.749854

The company’s newly released 2024 Impact Report paints a picture that is both ambitious and surprisingly pragmatic.
Its Vietnamese apparel manufacturing operations are aiming for 100% renewable energy by 2027, with 35% on-site solar expected by 2026.
The 2024 Impact Report is less a PR exercise than a blueprint for what clean manufacturing at scale can look like.","For years, fashion manufacturing has faced an uncomfortable paradox. The industry thrives on growth, yet its environmental impact grows with it. Many brands talk about decarbonisation but few have shown that expansion and sustainability can truly move in the same direction. Saitex, the Vietnam and US-based apparel and denim manufacturer, appears to be one of the rare exceptions.

The company’s newly released 2024 Impact Report paints a picture that is both ambitious and surprisingly pragmatic. Production volumes surged – apparel output rose by 25% and denim mill production more than doubled – yet carbon emissions per garment fell by 18% and per metre of fabric by 16%. Electricity use declined, renewable energy use climbed, waste was reduced and community programmes expanded their reach.

In short, Saitex grew, but its footprint didn’t.

“Our mission has never been about incremental change, but about systemic transformation,” says founder and CEO Sanjeev Bahl.

It’s not an empty statement. Since its founding in 2001, Saitex has steadily built a reputation as ‘the cleanest denim factory in the world’, transforming from a straightforward manufacturer into a fully fledged ecosystem. It now includes vertically integrated production sites in Vietnam and the US, its own fabric mill, circular innovation through the Stelapop upcycling lab, workforce inclusion initiatives such as Rekut and creative repair collaborations through Atelier & Repairs.

The numbers behind this transformation are telling. Electricity consumption per garment dropped by nearly 7% and steam use fell by more than a quarter. The company planted thousands of trees through its partnership with Gaia Nature Conservation, supporting a broader carbon offset strategy that reached 35% last year.

At its denim mill, 70% of energy now comes from renewable sources, with waste reduced by 8% and 92% of remaining material recycled.

Community outreach programmes also grew last year, reaching more than 13,000 people through clean water projects, education schemes and environmental awareness campaigns. The Rekut initiative continues to bring disabled workers into the core workforce, while a new Gaia x Saitex employee project links workplace action to ecosystem restoration.

The report isn’t all polished success though. Water use and wastewater discharge rose temporarily because of planned filter maintenance, while gas consumption increased due to growing demand for 3D fashion processes. An internal labour audit found cases of undeclared Sunday work, which have since been rectified through back pay, retraining and new compliance systems. Saitex doesn’t gloss over these setbacks, framing them as part of a process of continuous improvement, with fixes already underway.

The company’s roadmap is equally bold. Its Vietnamese apparel manufacturing operations are aiming for 100% renewable energy by 2027, with 35% on-site solar expected by 2026. The denim mill plans to complete a closed-loop wastewater system by the end of 2025 and is working towards net-zero operations by 2030. System-wide, Saitex is pushing further into circular design, expanding the use of NFC-powered trims and setting its sights not just on neutrality but on becoming carbon positive.

In a sector often criticised for lofty sustainability promises that never quite translate into action, Saitex stands out for showing its workings. Its approach isn’t perfect, but it is transparent, data-driven and unapologetically ambitious. The 2024 Impact Report is less a PR exercise than a blueprint for what clean manufacturing at scale can look like.

As fashion brands face increasing regulatory pressure and consumer scrutiny, the industry will need more than aspirational rhetoric. Saitex, as an example, example suggests that with the right infrastructure, clear goals and a willingness to tackle problems head-on, growth and decarbonisation don’t have to be at odds.",https://www.innovationintextiles.com/uploads/16651/Saitex1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 06:59:56.049723

Minister Hodgson said: “The Government of Canada is committed to reconciliation and supporting clean energy projects in Indigenous, rural and remote communities.
Through meaningful equity partnerships, our sector is fostering job creation, local economic growth and shared prosperity in Indigenous communities.
At 7.5MW, Innavik is the largest commissioned project under the CERRC program and the largest remote community-scale renewable energy project in the country.","The Government of Canada has announced nearly $17 million in federal funding for two Indigenous-led hydropower projects in Quebec aimed at reducing diesel dependence and advancing community energy autonomy.

Brendan Hanley, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Northern and Arctic Affairs, made the announcement on behalf of the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources. The funding will support the 7.5MW Innavik Remote Hydro Project in Inukjuak and a feasibility initiative to develop a 17MW hydroelectric plant at the Matawin dam near Saint-Michel-des-Saints.

The Innavik Remote Hydro Project, a run-of-river facility, replaces nearly all diesel generation in the Nunavik community of Inukjuak. Jointly owned by the Pituvik Landholding Corporation and Innergex Renewable Energy, the project is the largest off-grid hydropower installation in Canada and supplies clean electricity to approximately 1800 residents.

The Matawak Hydroelectric Power Plant project, led by Énergie Matawak S.E.C., represents a partnership between the Atikamekw Nation of Manawan and the Innu Nation of Lac-Saint-Jean. Planned at the existing Hydro-Québec Matawin dam on the Lac Taureau reservoir, the 17MW plant would help meet local energy needs and generate long-term revenue for the participating Nations. Construction is expected to begin in 2026.

Federal support comes through two programs: $14.9 million from the Clean Energy for Rural and Remote Communities (CERRC) program for Innavik, and over $1.7 million from the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program (SREPs) for Matawak.

Minister Hodgson said: “The Government of Canada is committed to reconciliation and supporting clean energy projects in Indigenous, rural and remote communities. In collaboration with governments, Indigenous partners and the energy sector, we are investing in initiatives to create economic growth in communities while tackling climate change.”

Hanley added: “I am proud to see the largest off-grid hydropower project in Canada come to life and the exploration of more community-led initiatives in Canada’s Northern regions. These projects are a powerful example of what’s possible when Indigenous leadership and community vision come together, not only to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance on diesel but also to strengthen energy independence and create lasting social and economic benefits for communities. We are proud to support initiatives like this that build a cleaner, more inclusive energy future for all Canadians.”

Tommy Palliser, President of the Pituvik Landholding Corporation, said: “The Innavik Hydro Project is an affirmation of a sustainable future for the Inuit community of Inukjuak. The project realizes a 20-year vision for Inuit-led and co-owned clean energy infrastructure that generates impacts for the Inuit beneficiaries of our community, through proactive and positive partnership with Innergex Renewable Energy, supported by the Governments of Canada and Quebec.”

Michel Letellier, President and CEO of Innergex Renewable Energy, commented: “When Pituvik Landholding Corporation invited us to join them on this journey, we partnered closely with the people of Inukjuak to shape a project that reflects their vision and meets their needs. This project is a source of pride for all of us at Innergex because it directly improves daily life in Inukjuak while supporting the community’s long-term energy independence. We are grateful for the collaboration and confidence of our Inuit partners, and we thank everyone who worked to make the community’s vision a reality.”

“First Nations must be involved in the development of the resources on their territory,” emphasised Keith-Michel Flamand, President of Énergie Matawak S.E.C. “We all live together on this land and work in partnership, guided by harmony and mutual respect. The goal of Énergie Matawak is not only to produce energy but also to do so responsibly while protecting our environment. Our project is one that carries hope for the future.”

Lorena Patterson, President and CEO of WaterPower Canada, said, “This investment in Indigenous-led hydropower projects exemplifies the economic reconciliation our sector is committed to advancing. Through meaningful equity partnerships, our sector is fostering job creation, local economic growth and shared prosperity in Indigenous communities. Collaboration with Indigenous Peoples is integral to building the sustainable, reliable and clean energy infrastructure Canada needs to achieve its climate goals while ensuring Indigenous communities have a true stake in our energy future.”

Dry Bulk | Trade & Commodities

We have reached a FID (Final Investment Decision) with the UK Government to build the world’s first carbon capture facility to enable fully decarbonised cement production.

The announcement, made recently by Michael Shanks, Energy Minister in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, allows Heidelberg Materials to begin construction of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at their Padeswood cement works in north Wales.

Energy Minister Michael Shanks said: “Our clean-energy mission means good jobs, regional growth, and investment for local communities.

“This trailblazing cement works showcases the north Wales workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation through this UK-first project.”

The funding decision aligns with the UK Government’s ambitions to reduce CO₂ emissions and deliver economic growth through construction.

The Padeswood project is the first of its kind in the UK and is Group’s first full-scale carbon capture facility to reach FID. Construction will start later this year and the facility will enable the production of evoZero carbon captured net zero cement for the construction industry in 2029.

The CCS project will bring significant economic benefits to north Wales through investment and job creation: it will protect over 200 jobs and create around 50 new ones, as well as up to 500 more during construction.

Cement is an essential construction material. It is the ‘glue’ in concrete, the most widely used building material in the world, but its production gives rise to CO₂. As these emissions result from the chemical process involved in cement’s manufacture, they cannot be avoided by using low carbon or renewable energy sources. The only way to remove them and produce the net zero cement the UK needs is to capture them using CCS before they enter the atmosphere.

The carbon capture facility at Padeswood is designed to capture almost all (around 95 per cent) of the CO₂ emissions from the process. The emissions captured from the kiln include biogenic CO₂ from biomass fuels, mainly from domestic food, wood and paper wastes that cannot be recycled, which could allow the cement produced at Padeswood to be net negative.*

The carbon captured at Padeswood will be compressed and transported via an underground pipeline for secure storage under the seabed in Liverpool Bay as part of the HyNet North West project.

CEO Simon Willis said: “Our constructive partnership with the UK Government has allowed us to reach this major milestone, which is fantastic news, not just for us, but for the industry as a whole.

“Our new facility at Padeswood will be a world-leader. It will capture around 800,000 tonnes of CO₂ a year from our existing cement works, allowing us to produce evoZero carbon captured net zero cement, which will help the UK construction industry reach its decarbonisation aims.

“CCS is a growing sector worldwide and our Padeswood project is an exemplar, helping position the UK as a global force at the forefront of this technology. It will also pave the way to decarbonising our domestic cement industry, helping it remain competitive while mitigating against climate change.”

*Biomass is carbon neutral as trees and crops remove CO₂ from the atmosphere as they grow by storing it within their cells. Any CO₂ released from these materials in the kiln would also be captured by the carbon capture facility. As a result, the capture of biogenic CO₂ could allow the cement produced at Padeswood to be net negative.",https://www.drycargomag.com/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-10-06 07:00:00.206752

Only a Dracut drop of nearly a dime was left out of overall gains ranging from a little more than C5 cents to nearly a quarter. A low-end quote of $2.40 for volatile Tennessee Zone 4 was by far the cheapest market price. Gains were fairly evenly distributed among geographic regions.

Despite a nominally bullish report of a 55 Bcf addition to storage in the week ending Aug. 26, when consensus expectations had been mostly in the low 60s Bcf, Nymex traders saw fit to discount both the Energy Information Administration data and the likely tropical storm entering the offshore production area in sending the October futures contract 0.4 cent cent lower (see related story).

A broad area of low pressure a couple of hundred miles south of the Louisiana coast at midday Thursday had an 80% chance of becoming Tropical Storm Lee within the succeeding 48 hours, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.

Tropical Storm Katia briefly achieved hurricane status before being downgraded to a tropical storm again, but it was expected to restrengthen while continuing to churn toward the west-northwest in open Atlantic waters about 930 miles west of the northern Leeward Islands. An expected turn to the north was likely to keep it well out to sea. Similarly, a low-pressure system about 350 miles north of Bermuda had a 50% chance of tropical storm development, NHC said, but its northeastward movement would take it away from the East Coast.

In a report on GOM evacuations due to the Invest 93L area of tropical disturbance, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEM) said 127 MMcf/d of shut-ins, or 2.4% of normal Gulf output, had been reported to it by 11:30 a.m. CDT Thursday. Personnel had been evacuated from nine production platforms, but none of the mobile drilling rigs, BOEM said (see related story). It added that 79,989 b/d of GOM oil production, or about 5.7%, had been suspended.

The shut-in volume obviously was growing as following the BOEM report Transco said about 200 MMcf/d scheduled to flow into its system was offline. However, based on the projected storm track and intensity, Transco did not anticipate any supply allocations as a result of storm-related supply interruptions.

WeatherBell Analytics chief meteorologist Joe Bastardi said what he expects to become Tropical Storm Lee may be the slowest-moving storm in the northern GOM since Hurricane Juan in 1985, a storm that took five days to move across the Gulf's open waters. ""Parts of the Gulf of Mexico's offshore oil and gas producing areas could experience gales for four or five days as Lee will be very slow to move before finally making up its mind to move out of the area,"" Bastardi said. ""The endgame is still unclear, but what is obvious is the northwest Gulf is in for a siege from a tropical cyclone that will impact the energy industry for at least several days, even though Lee may not be as intense as some of the other storms this year.""

Although highs ahead of a front would reach the 90s to the mid 100s Friday from Minnesota through the Great Lakes and southwest to Kansas, The Weather Channel said, a fall chill will replace them quickly during the weekend. The Northeast's price gains ignored generally mild temperature forecasts, while much of the Gulf Coast area will soon be cooling down as well from the rains anticipated from the low-pressure area heading toward Louisiana. The area from Louisiana, Arkansas and western Tennessee through the desert Southwest can expect hot peaks from the upper 90s through the low 110s to continue a bit longer, but the Rockies is due for a dramatic cooldown, with Denver forecast to go from a high around 97 Thursday to the mid 80s Friday, according to Weather Underground.

Is it fall already? Northern Natural Gas illustrated how short-lived the current warm-up in the Midwest will be, saying a system-weighted average temperature of 82 Thursday was projected to plummet to 69, 66 and 61 on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively.

Pipeline constraints were minimal heading into the weekend.

Northwest was probably typical among pipelines in asking shippers to avoid ""excessive banking"" on its system during the Labor Day weekend, citing a declining amount of available capacity in its balancing accounts at the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin storage facilities.

For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology. There's also typically no maintenance or end-of-lease panel removal concerns with the contracts, according to Palmetto, another North Carolina company that offers leases.

""We believe solar energy should be accessible and affordable to all and are committed to bringing clean energy opportunities to homeowners through our offering of the first solar plus storage lease in North Carolina. We appreciate that Spruce Power customized a servicing solution to meet our needs,"" EnerWealth CEO Ajulo Othow said in the statement.

Batteries provide stored electricity for later use, and even to charge electric vehicles. Customers can even sell it back to the grid, depending on plans and programs available in the area, and the lease agreement.

Leasing is also a great way to limit the electricity needed from dirty fuels that cause planet-warming air pollution. NASA has linked the gases to greater risks for extreme heat that could soon leave some places uninhabitable.

It's all good news for energy-savvy Tar Heel homeowners, as well as for the industry as a whole. Federal solar tax incentives expire at the end of the year, but Investing.com reported that Spruce was enjoying solid stock market performance earlier this month when the partnership with EnerWealth was announced.

It's also important for customers to understand the benefits of both leasing and buying. EnergySage said that an array can cost around $30,000 on average, before credits. EnergySage is a free online resource that can help customers compare quotes, find the right installer, and secure all the rebates before they are gone. Fast action can save up to $10,000 when buying a system.

Palmetto — in the business for more than 16 years — has a great guide that lists pros and cons for leasing and buying. It offers leases through LightReach and has more than 500,000 accounts. It's important to know your options to make the best decision. If you plan on selling your home soon, leasing likely isn't the best option, for example.

In North Carolina, Spruce ""will deliver the operational infrastructure that enables EnerWealth to scale rapidly while maintaining exceptional homeowner experiences,"" according to the release.

Billing, collections, support, and remote monitoring are all part of Spruce's expertise, proved by having managed 145,000 ""residential solar assets"" around the country, the statement continued.

The center recently conducted a pilot Bexar County Omnibus Survey, giving researchers and organizations insights from thousands of local residents who are on the center’s county panel.

One of the standout findings was the strong support for nuclear energy, with 65% of residents in favor, notably higher than the national average of 59-61%. The survey showed 17% expressed opposition, with safety being the most common concern.

These results mirror national policy trends and reflect a growing momentum behind nuclear energy expansion.

“We found remarkable alignment between the Trump administration’s nuclear renaissance strategy and public sentiment both nationally and locally,” said Chris Reddick, professor of public administration in the College for Health, Community and Policy at UT San Antonio. “This convergence of favorable public opinion, technological readiness and political will creates what may be unprecedented conditions for American nuclear expansion since the 1970s.”

Fostering research and collaboration

Among the groups submitting questions for the survey was the university’s CONsortium on Nuclear sECurity Technologies (CONNECT), a program that seeks to establish career pathways between the U.S. Department of Energy and students at minority-serving institutions majoring in STEM fields such as physics, engineering and computer science.

The mission of CONNECT is to foster interdisciplinary research, collaboration and professional networks within the field of nuclear security.

In 2022, renewed funding from the National Nuclear Security Administration expanded CONNECT to foster new collaborations between UT San Antonio faculty in science and engineering and those in global affairs and public administration.

“In addition to the cross-disciplinary mentoring and training, we’ve become really excited about the advancement of nuclear energy from not just the technical aspects but also the policy advancements and public engagement side,” said Elizabeth Sooby, project director of CONNECT and associate dean for research in the College of Sciences.

Sooby saw the Bexar County Omnibus Survey as an opportunity to gain new insight into the local community’s perspective on nuclear energy expansion and worked with CPOR to include four questions related to nuclear energy on the survey.

Regional attitudes and needs

One of the goals with the Bexar County Panel and our Omnibus Survey is to facilitate research at UT San Antonio and generate insights into the attitudes and needs of the San Antonio metropolitan region, said Bryan Gervais, director of CPOR and associate professor of political science and geography.

“We were very happy to work with Dr. Sooby and her team on this project — and I think their work highlights the range of projects that can benefit from our panel,” Gervais said. “By providing high-quality samples, we hope to keep more resources here at [the university] rather than going to external, commercial companies who charge a lot more.”

The nuclear energy questions included in the survey asked respondents what level they believe nuclear energy should contribute to the U.S. electricity supply, about their personal view of nuclear energy, concerns about nuclear energy, and what their level of understanding is toward nuclear energy.

“These questions were designed to capture both the level of public support for nuclear energy and the concerns influencing people’s views,” said Jesus Facundo, a doctoral student in physics who wrote the survey questions. “Nuclear energy is playing a growing role in national conversations about climate change and energy security, and it’s important to understand how our community sees the issue so we can connect those broader discussions to local priorities.”

Sooby said that the community’s response aligns with, and will continue to shape, the research happening at UT San Antonio, reinforcing how the university’s discovery enterprise is serving the interests and concerns of the region.

“These questions are just the tip of the iceberg and it’s exciting to see that our local community is interested in nuclear energy while cautiously concerned about all the things we are tackling in our research efforts here [with regard to] the safety and security of these empowering technologies,” Sooby said.",https://news.utsa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nuclear-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 05:00:01.281926

That news came just a week after its rival, Trina Solar, opened a smaller factory in Central Java province.

During the first six months of this year, Indonesians bought nearly as many electric vehicles as they did in all of 2024 — almost all from Chinese brands.

As competition among clean energy firms intensifies in China, its biggest EV and renewables companies are making inroads into Indonesia, positioning themselves for the day Southeast Asia weans itself off fossil fuels.

One example: Trina’s 1.5 trillion rupiah ($90 million) solar panel factory at Kendal Industrial Park in Central Java. PT Trina Mas Agra Indonesia (TMAI), the company’s joint venture with a local partner, employs 640 workers producing 1 gigawatt (GW) of next-generation solar panels that last longer and perform better in cloudy conditions.

TMAI chief financial officer Martha Octavia told Mongabay the factory could triple production if needed.

“The important point is that we are fully prepared, both in terms of technology and infrastructure, to scale when the timing is right,” Octavia said in emailed remarks.

For now, the company is positioning itself to supply panels for some of the nearly 15 GW of utility-scale solar projects in Indonesia’s pipeline, according to data published in February by Global Energy Monitor.

At present, Indonesia has just over 560 megawatts (MW) of solar power feeding the grid — roughly the same as Honduras, and far behind smaller neighbors like Malaysia, which has 2 GW.

Indonesia’s slow uptake of clean energy risks slowing the pace of Chinese investment that otherwise would be coming as producers there seek new markets.

Indonesia remains a largely untapped renewables market, while Chinese solar panel makers face brutal competition at home and mounting losses after Beijing ended solar incentives amid a domestic supply glut.

That presents a rare opportunity for Indonesia to woo investment from China, said Edwin Widjonarko, co-founder of Xurya Daya, which installs and maintains rooftop solar panels for clients such as Tokopedia, the Indonesian e-commerce giant.

“There’s been a bit of a shock for them,” Widjonarko said of conditions at home for Chinese panel makers.

“Indonesia is not yet developed in terms of solar usage. You can produce panels here for the domestic market and you wouldn’t have to export. This is a really big market.”

The problem is that tight quotas, set by Indonesia’s state-owned utility PLN, limit rooftop solar installations for PLN customers, dampening enthusiasm among foreign investors.

PLN’s latest 10-year electricity supply road map caps rooftop solar capacity at 3 GW. Annual quotas range from 162 MW next year to 410 MW in 2028.

By comparison, China installed 198 GW of solar capacity — hundreds of millions of panels — during the first five months of this year alone.

In June, LONGi announced it would build a 1.4 GW solar panel factory in West Java in partnership with Pertamina’s renewables arm, Pertamina New and Renewable Energy.

“Indonesia holds immense potential in renewable energy, and LONGi is proud to contribute our world-leading solar technology to this transformative journey,” Dennis She, the company’s global vice president, said in a statement at the time.

TMAI said its Central Java factory simplifies supply chains, supports domestic suppliers, and reduces demand for energy imports.

Falling battery storage costs and greater grid investments should improve prospects for intermittent renewables such as wind and solar.

TMAI said it’s taking the long view of the Indonesian market.

“Over time, technologies like energy storage, smarter grids and better management will help balance variable supply and keep systems stable,” Octavia said.

According to PLN’s 10-year blueprint, published in May, Indonesia will add about 53 GW of renewable generating capacity and storage over the next decade, though nearly three-quarters of it is slated for the second half of the 2025-2035 period, after a surge in gas-fired capacity scheduled for the first half.

“Global outlooks show that integrating renewables is both feasible and increasingly cost-effective, especially as storage becomes cheaper.”

Electricity generated by solar or wind costs roughly three-quarters that of coal, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a U.S. nonprofit, reported last year.

Beijing is scaling back incentives after hitting its clean-energy goals six years early. With more than half of China’s installed generating capacity now coming from renewables, clean-energy projects that go online from June no longer benefit from guaranteed minimum tariffs.

That has many Chinese companies scrambling for new markets.

Since 2022, Chinese renewable energy firms, EV battery makers and automakers have announced about $70 billion in investments in Indonesia, spanning mining, processing and manufacturing.

One of those, a $6 billion power battery venture launched in 2022 by Indonesian Battery Corporation and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL), is scheduled to begin operations at the end of next year.

In June, Indonesia’s deputy energy and mineral resources minister, Yuliot Tanjung, said CATL would also begin making EVs in Indonesia by next March.

Consultancy PwC estimates EVs will account for 29% of new car sales in Indonesia by 2030, up from 15% in 2024.

Growth in the EV sector is a bright spot in Indonesia’s otherwise shrinking vehicle market, buoyed by rebates on value-added tax and luxury goods tax. The government earmarked 5 trillion rupiah ($301 million) for rebates in 2025, but has said it will end subsidies for imported EVs at the close of this year.

Failing to deal with red tape and ending incentives too soon risks failing to capitalize fully on the sudden shift in Chinese clean energy investment, Xurya’s Widjonarko said.

“This is a rare opportunity — probably a once-in-a-lifetime chance for us to build a reliable domestic supply chain with Chinese technologies,” Widjonarko said.

“The timing is quite sweet.”

“The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.” The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company.
There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.
Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
“The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.” No large coal power plants have come online in the US since 2013.","US officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

RUSHING TO APPROVE PROJECTS

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive US coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a September 23 speech to the UN General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of US supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling USD 8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernise coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centres.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

COAL DEMAND PLUMMETS

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over USD 126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of USD 35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

AGEING PLANTS AND OPTIMISM

The largest US coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the US could increase by 250 million tons annually — up almost 50 per cent from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants could burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""US coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The US has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the US since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost USD 25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at the remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.

Overview of the Grant Proposal

This grant proposal aims to establish a Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program designed to support aspiring entrepreneurs in developing innovative clean energy solutions. The program will provide training, mentorship, and funding opportunities to help participants turn their ideas into viable businesses. By focusing on clean energy, the program seeks to address both environmental concerns and economic challenges faced by communities, particularly those that are underserved or economically disadvantaged.

The proposed program will be structured around a series of workshops, networking events, and one-on-one mentorship sessions. Participants will learn about various aspects of entrepreneurship, including business planning, market analysis, and funding strategies. Additionally, the program will connect participants with industry experts and potential investors who can provide valuable insights and resources.

By equipping aspiring entrepreneurs with the necessary skills and knowledge, the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program aims to foster a new generation of leaders in the clean energy sector.

Background and Rationale for the Proposal

The urgency of transitioning to clean energy sources has never been more apparent. Climate change poses significant risks to our planet, affecting ecosystems, weather patterns, and human health. As governments and organizations worldwide commit to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, there is an increasing demand for innovative solutions that can facilitate this transition.

However, many aspiring entrepreneurs lack the resources and support needed to bring their ideas to fruition. This gap presents an opportunity for targeted intervention through a dedicated program focused on clean energy entrepreneurship. Moreover, many communities, particularly those in low-income areas, are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation and climate change.

These communities often face barriers to accessing clean energy technologies and resources. By empowering individuals from these backgrounds to become clean energy entrepreneurs, we can create pathways for economic development while simultaneously addressing environmental injustices. This proposal seeks to bridge the gap between aspiration and action by providing the necessary support for aspiring entrepreneurs to thrive in the clean energy sector.

Objectives and Goals of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program

The primary objective of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program is to empower aspiring entrepreneurs with the skills, knowledge, and resources needed to develop successful clean energy businesses. To achieve this objective, the program will focus on several key goals. First, it aims to provide comprehensive training on various aspects of entrepreneurship, including business development, marketing strategies, and financial management.

This training will equip participants with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of starting and running a business. Another goal of the program is to foster collaboration among participants by creating a supportive community of like-minded individuals. Networking opportunities will be integral to this effort, allowing participants to share ideas, experiences, and resources.

Additionally, the program will facilitate connections with industry experts who can offer mentorship and guidance throughout the entrepreneurial journey. By building a strong network of support, participants will be better positioned to succeed in their ventures.

Target Audience and Beneficiaries

The target audience for the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program includes aspiring entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds who are interested in developing clean energy solutions. This includes individuals who may have innovative ideas but lack the resources or knowledge to bring them to market. The program will specifically prioritize participants from underserved communities who are often marginalized in traditional entrepreneurial ecosystems.

Beneficiaries of the program will extend beyond the participants themselves. As these aspiring entrepreneurs develop their businesses, they will create job opportunities within their communities, contributing to local economic growth. Additionally, by promoting clean energy solutions, these businesses will help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate environmental impacts.

Ultimately, the program aims to create a ripple effect that benefits both individuals and communities while advancing the transition to a sustainable energy future.

Methodology and Implementation Plan

The implementation of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program will follow a structured methodology designed to maximize participant engagement and learning outcomes. The program will begin with an application process to select participants based on their passion for clean energy and their potential for entrepreneurial success. Once selected, participants will undergo an intensive training curriculum that covers essential topics such as business planning, market research, funding sources, and regulatory considerations.

In addition to formal training sessions, the program will incorporate hands-on workshops where participants can apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios. These workshops will include activities such as developing business models, conducting feasibility studies, and creating marketing strategies for their clean energy solutions. Furthermore, participants will have access to mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs and industry professionals who can provide personalized guidance tailored to their specific needs.

Budget and Financial Plan

A comprehensive budget is essential for ensuring the successful implementation of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program. The financial plan will outline projected costs associated with training materials, workshop facilitation, venue rentals, marketing efforts, and participant support services. Funding sources may include grants from government agencies, private foundations, corporate sponsorships, and individual donations.

To ensure transparency and accountability, the budget will be regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed throughout the program’s duration. Additionally, participants may be encouraged to contribute a nominal fee to cover some costs while still ensuring accessibility for those from low-income backgrounds. This approach not only fosters a sense of ownership among participants but also helps sustain the program’s financial viability in the long term.

Evaluation and Impact Assessment

To measure the effectiveness of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program, a robust evaluation framework will be established. This framework will include both qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess participant progress and overall program impact. Key performance indicators may include participant satisfaction rates, business launch success rates, job creation statistics, and environmental impact assessments related to clean energy solutions developed by participants.

Regular feedback sessions will be conducted throughout the program to gather insights from participants regarding their experiences and challenges faced during their entrepreneurial journey. This feedback will inform ongoing improvements to the program structure and content. At the conclusion of the program, a comprehensive impact assessment report will be generated to highlight successes, lessons learned, and recommendations for future iterations of the program.

Sustainability and Long-Term Impact

Sustainability is a core principle of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program. To ensure its long-term viability, strategies will be implemented to secure ongoing funding and support beyond initial grant funding. This may include establishing partnerships with local businesses that can provide resources or mentorship opportunities for participants.

Additionally, creating a network of alumni from the program can foster continued engagement and collaboration among past participants. Alumni can serve as mentors for new cohorts while also sharing their success stories to inspire future entrepreneurs. By cultivating a strong community around clean energy entrepreneurship, we can create lasting change that extends well beyond the duration of the program itself.

Partnerships and Collaborations

Building strategic partnerships is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program. Collaborations with local universities can provide access to research resources and expertise in clean energy technologies. Additionally, partnerships with established clean energy companies can offer valuable insights into industry trends and best practices.

Engaging with local government agencies can also facilitate access to funding opportunities and regulatory guidance for aspiring entrepreneurs. By leveraging these partnerships, the program can create a comprehensive support system that empowers participants while also contributing to broader community goals related to sustainability and economic development.

Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, the Clean Energy Entrepreneurship Program represents a significant opportunity to empower aspiring entrepreneurs while addressing critical environmental challenges. By providing training, mentorship, and resources tailored specifically for clean energy solutions, we can foster innovation that leads to sustainable economic growth. Next steps involve finalizing the grant proposal for submission while actively seeking potential partners who share our vision for promoting clean energy entrepreneurship.

Engaging with community stakeholders will also be crucial in refining our approach and ensuring that we meet the needs of our target audience effectively. Together, we can pave the way for a brighter future powered by clean energy innovation.

In the pursuit of advancing clean energy entrepreneurship for a net-zero world, it is essential to explore various funding opportunities and initiatives that align with this goal. One such initiative is the International Climate Initiative, which supports projects focused on climate change mitigation and biodiversity.

The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.","Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

[Running Out: Texas’ water crisis — and the path forward]

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

[Data centers are thirsty for Texas’ water, but state planners don’t know how much they will need]

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

,Clean Energy ,2025-10-06 07:30:45+00:00,Canary Media,Major Midwest port begins electrifying operations to reduce emissions - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/sea-transport/cleveland-midwest-port-electrification-federal-grant,"To address both problems, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
We also want to stay ahead of regulations,” said Bryan Celik, a contract engineer for the Port of Cleveland.
The goal covers the port’s direct Scope 1 emissions, as well as its Scope 2 emissions for energy use.
For Brito, this sort of collaboration is key to the success of port electrification.
“Realizing that potential will require buy-in from — and coordination with — the regional networks of industry, nonprofit, and government actors affected by ports’ electrification,” he said.","One of the largest ports in the Midwest is officially starting to decarbonize, thanks to a Biden-era grant program that has so far survived the Trump administration’s assault on all things clean energy.

Late last month, the Port of Cleveland began renovating its main warehouse on the shore of Lake Erie. When the work is complete, Warehouse A will have roughly 2 megawatts’ worth of rooftop solar panels, plus battery storage and numerous charging ports for cargo-handling equipment.

Cleveland, which received a $94 million award from the Clean Ports Program announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last fall, is one of three Great Lakes port groups benefitting from the funding. Although the agency has reneged on many other funding commitments under President Donald Trump, work and payments for the $2.9 billion ports program are still moving ahead.

The country’s more than 300 ports, which ship and receive the materials, food, and other products that Americans rely on, are mostly powered by fossil fuels. Their cranes, forklifts, and other freight-handling equipment burn diesel fuel, and so do the ships and boats docked at those ports, sending not only planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere but toxic pollution that can harm the people who work and live nearby.

To address both problems, the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority has set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. ​“We want to have a lower impact on surrounding communities. We also want to stay ahead of regulations,” said Bryan Celik, a contract engineer for the Port of Cleveland. The goal covers the port’s direct Scope 1 emissions, as well as its Scope 2 emissions for energy use.

Global shipping companies face increasing pressure to decarbonize boats and ships, and technology for wind-powered and battery-powered vessels has improved in recent years.

The U.S. has previously taken steps toward decarbonizing shipping, including by partnering with Norway on the Green Shipping Challenge, but the Trump administration has scuttled progress this year. Trump also opposes a proposed global fee on greenhouse gas emissions that the International Maritime Organization will consider formally adopting this month.

The nearly $3 billion in Clean Ports Program funding nationwide ​“has transformative potential for U.S. ports,” said Jerold Brito, a program associate with the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that helped coordinate a Sept. 25 event on regional port electrification hosted by the Port of Cleveland.

Indeed, Cleveland is not alone in its efforts to clean up its port. The Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority, for example, has an even more ambitious goal of reaching net-zero for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040, said its sustainability manager, Taylor Mitchell.

Because so much is shipped through ports, Mitchell says, electrifying these hubs of commerce is a ​“cool opportunity to have a really huge impact on the planet.”

Getting everyone on board

During the late September event organized by the Electrification Coalition, representatives from Cleveland, Detroit, and Hamilton, Ontario, met with contractors and others in industry and nonprofit organizations to share plans and address challenges.

For Brito, this sort of collaboration is key to the success of port electrification.

“Realizing that potential will require buy-in from — and coordination with — the regional networks of industry, nonprofit, and government actors affected by ports’ electrification,” he said.

For example, work at Cleveland’s Warehouse A necessitates collaborating with Cleveland Public Power, the city’s municipal utility. While solar panels and battery storage at the warehouse will eventually provide much of the port’s electricity needs, it still requires more grid power in order to fully electrify.

Other phases of the work will add cabling and connections for vessels to operate with electric power while they’re in port. That ​“shore power,” or cold ironing, could let boats and ships shut off their diesel engines until it’s time to get underway again.

Additionally, Logistec USA, the port operator, will acquire an electric crane and electric forklifts. And the Great Lakes Towing Co. will build two electric tugboats.

Coordination with other stakeholders also presents challenges for the Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority. ​“We really don’t have much of a footprint ourselves,” except for a cruise dock, noted Mark Schrupp, executive director for the port authority.

Instead, most cargo carried by boats and ships moves through private docks in industrial port areas around the city. ​“We’ve definitely got to think of ways to get the private sector on board.”

But companies may not want to take some steps on an individual basis, such as constructing and installing power lines and charging equipment at privately owned docks that would only be used part-time.

So the Detroit/​Wayne County Port Authority is exploring alternatives, such as how hydrogen could produce clean electricity aboard a boat that could then act as a mobile plug-in port for docked vessels’ shore power.

Developing shore power calls for even more groups working together on a broader scale. ​“We really need a standard as much for a port as for a ship, because if there is a mismatch, you would have invested all of that for nothing,” said Hugo Daniel, a doctoral candidate at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec who researches engineering challenges in shore power. Ideally, Canada and the United States will join forces on a strategy for the Great Lakes that aligns with practices from California, the European Union, and China, he said.

Without standards set at the regional and national level, states and cities that try to compel changes on their own could see shippers simply move to other ports with more lax rules, Schrupp said. While some firms looking to slash their supply-chain emissions might prefer to work with a port that is decarbonizing operations, others might avoid areas that could restrict their diesel use.

Great Lakes ports are big economic drivers. More than 23,000 jobs and about $7 billion in annual economic activity are tied to Cleveland’s port alone, Celik said. Yet it and other inland ports handle a smaller volume of business than most of their counterparts on the East and West coasts, making it that much harder to spread costs and recoup major investments like electrification.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/image-11_2025-10-03-210334_mqua.png?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=bcc2c37f7f3fedd13e3c02fc5e1e9470,N,,2025-10-06 03:58:44.039221

As government programs lost funding and resources thinned out, Welcome Tech quickly became the premiere platform for companies experiencing acute labor shortages, especially in sectors like construction, manufacturing, agriculture and hospitality.

“Ironically, it has led to a lot of growth because when you take a scenario where the consumer segment that we serve has less places to turn,” said Amir Hemmat, the co-founder and chief executive of Welcome Tech. “There are certainly less players coming into the market, and there are many players who are just disappearing because they don’t have the ability to navigate this.”

The interplay between nimble, fast-moving tech startups and the slow bureaucratic federal government has evolved over the last 20 years. There was once a time when technology and legislation operated parallel to one another. It took years for the federal and state governments to understand new categories of services like the gig economy or digital likeness. As a result, government agencies have put restrictions on such tech firms.

Today, the health of the startup sector depends heavily on federal priorities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Energy and the National Science Foundation are among the top 10 most active investors in the country, according to PitchBook. Weapons, logistics, manufacturing and clean energy startups have rushed to gobble up federal innovation funds, navigate ongoing tariffs and establish themselves as the solution to carbon-related tax penalties.

However, for companies like Welcome Tech that specifically cater to populations increasingly under scrutiny by the Trump administration, that means navigating growth under new conditions.

“Corporations and their choices could be some sort of counterweight to the actions of the administration,” said Ramesh Srinivasan, a professor at the department of information studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There are levels to power and counter power.”

Operating under uncertainty

Grindr Inc. understands what it’s like to be a company treading through hostile waters. Founded in 2009, the West Hollywood-based queer dating app is restricted in some form in at least 20 countries, cutting the publicly traded company off from swathes of potential users.

“We really do see a link between helping our users connect in the product and our success as a public company,” said AJ Balance, the chief product officer of Grindr.

The company reported favorable second quarter earnings in August, and it announced plans to capitalize on its first-mover success in queer dating by expanding its travel capabilities. The new option came after the company noticed users often changed their location to places they were traveling to in order to get a feel of queer-friendly spaces – like bars, local bookstores or historically queer neighborhoods – in a new area.

Over a quarter – 27% – of Grindr users are traveling more than 50 miles from their home in any given week. But the company still must navigate the privacy implications for its users when developing new product offerings. After years of struggling, Grindr was finally able to add a map feature earlier this year without compromising users’ personal information.

“The gayborhoods in some ways are really special places in the world because they’re gathering places for the community that have played a part in advancing its rights,” said Balance. “We kind of facilitate that on a global scale.”

Ever-changing policies

Grindr isn’t the only one operating under ever-changing federal conditions. When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowed pharmacies to deliver abortion pills by mail during the pandemic, the goal was to limit foot traffic in overburdened health care facilities.

Culver City-based Honeybee Health became the first U.S. pharmacy to provide abortion pills, like mifepristone and misoprostol, by mail. Last year, the attorneys general of Missouri, Idaho and Kansas revived a lawsuit that would require the FDA to severely limit access to abortion medication.

“The Court of Appeals’ decision, which eliminates access to this vital health care service, will immediately and irreparably harm the public interest, users of mail-order mifepristone in particular, and companies like Honeybee, whose business depends on distributing mail-order mifepristone,” Honeybee Health wrote in a 2024 amicus brief to the Supreme Court.

Changing federal legislation has drastically impacted several other institutions as well. Children’s Hospital Los Angeles cut 439 positions in September after shuttering its gender-affirming care unit over the summer, citing Trump-related cuts as the impetus for both. Columbia, Brown and the University of California, Berkeley, have cooperated with federal probes regarding on-campus protests in order to access federal funding. UCLA is presently facing similar pressure from the Trump administration.

“Many companies we’ve seen, and media organizations and legal firms have all just decided it’s in their own self-interest to just go with what the administration wants them to do,” Srinivasan said. “It depends on value gained versus value lost.”

Tapping into a new consumer base

When Hemmat and Raul Lomeli first started Welcome Tech, they knew it would be a tough sell to venture firms. Immigrants were decidedly a difficult category to reach. Health care and financial services companies often concluded that their customer base wasn’t interested in traditional access to services, and didn’t want to adopt the conventional technological infrastructure used in the U.S.

“Brands and companies and organizations would create this narrative of high acquisition cost to hide or make up for the fact they were just horrible at reaching this customer base,” Hemmat said. “And what you’d realize is: no, this is just an audience that’s either lacking information or is unable to get a product or service at the right experience. Just like how we don’t want to get fees or be overcharged, why would we assume that these customers or these consumers would want that experience, right?”

Nevertheless, in late August, Welcome Tech announced it raised $7.5 million to scale the company. The recent fundraise came from the likes of Mubadala Capital, CityRock Ventures Partners and Next Legacy Partners – all of which are generalist funds. That’s a far cry from the family offices and social impact investors that gave Welcome Tech a boost when it first started out. The notion that immigrants were not a reachable category was pervasive.

“We built technology on the backend that allows us to have a very granular view into the data insights that nobody else really has today,” Hemmat said. “One of our monetization paths is being the resource to market researchers and brands who really are flying blind when it comes to this demographic.”

The company tripled its partnerships with brands and nabbed 4.5 million members in one year. Welcome Tech suddenly amassed a treasure trove of data-generated insights on a population that historically evaded companies, allowing brands to understand buying behaviors and develop products and services for that type of consumer. That in turn allowed that consumer to spend their money on products and services that applied to them.

“Regardless of what the policies are at the borders or what they’re trying to figure out,” Hemmat said, “once people are here, everybody agrees that they want folks who are contributing.”",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PG01_Welcome-Tech-Founder-Amir_Hemmat_pc_Welcome-Tech.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 03:58:54.899630

,Clean Energy ,2025-10-06 07:02:27+00:00,Mercomindia.com,Month in a Minute: Top Headlines from the Indian Renewable Sector in September 2025,Staff,,,,,https://www.mercomindia.com/month-in-a-minute-top-headlines-from-the-indian-renewable-sector-in-september-2025,"In March 2025, several developers in Rajasthan received notices from the regional load dispatch centres about time-block-wise curtailment of renewable energy.
The regulations are designed to facilitate the purchase, sale, and banking of renewable energy by consumers, generators, and traders.
The regulation specifies a minimum share of renewable energy consumption for electricity distribution licensees, open access consumers, and captive users.
The target of 43.33% RCO by FY 2030 comprises 3.48% from wind energy, 1.33% from hydro energy, 4.5% from distributed renewable energy, and 34.02% from other renewable energy sources.
The investigation was initiated following a joint application filed by FS India Solar Ventures, Jupiter International, Tata Power Solar, and TP Solar.","India’s solar sector is entering a decisive new phase. Starting September 1, 2025, all tenders require developers and installers to use solar modules compliant with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-II for solar cells. While the government’s push for domestic manufacturing is widely supported, the transition is expected to be uneven, with developers warning of cost increases and possible delays, and manufacturers racing to add capacity in time.

India added 2.8 GW of rooftop solar capacity in the first half (1H) of 2025, according to Mercom India’s newly released Q2 2025 India Rooftop Solar Market Report. The installations grew 158% year-over-year (YoY). During the second quarter (Q2) of 2025, 1,618 MW of rooftop solar systems were installed, an almost 33% increase from 1,216.6 MW in Q1 2025, and an over 121% increase from the 731 MW installed in Q2 2024. The installation growth in 1H and Q2 of 2025 was mostly driven by the clearance of delayed registrations under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, the commissioning of new systems, and enhancements to the PM Surya Ghar portal.

Nearly 4 GW of wind-solar energy has been curtailed in Rajasthan since March 2025 due to delays in transmission projects and lower power demand resulting from above-normal rainfall in north India. In March 2025, several developers in Rajasthan received notices from the regional load dispatch centres about time-block-wise curtailment of renewable energy. The curtailment, which started at 8.5% in March, rose to 51.5% by August. Solar and wind projects were granted a ‘must-run’ status in 2021.

The average system cost of large-scale solar projects fell again in the second quarter of 2025, continuing the steady downward trend. Indian TOPCon-based projects remain the most expensive, while Chinese mono PERC projects continue to come in at the lowest cost. On a quarterly basis, costs declined across the board. Indian DCR TOPCon dropped 1.3%, Indian DCR mono PERC 1.2%, Indian TOPCon 1.6%, Indian mono PERC 3.5%, Chinese TOPCon 1.5%, and Chinese mono PERC 1.5%. Chinese mono PERC accounted for the lowest share of total project cost at 38.9%, while Indian DCR TOPCon stayed at the top at 61.9%.

India added nearly 3.8 GW of solar open access capacity in 1H 2025, an over 4% decrease from 3.9 GW installed in the same period of 2024, according to Mercom India’s Q2 2025 Solar Open Access Market Report. Installations in 1H 2024 were higher as many open access developers expedited project commissioning before the reimposition of the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers. However, installations for 1H 2025 saw a slight dip, mainly due to delays in connectivity approvals and the limited availability of transmission infrastructure in Q1.

The reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 12% to 5% on solar cells and other renewable energy devices is likely to lower power costs for consumers while enhancing project viability for developers. Besides solar cells, windmills, and wind-operated electricity generators, as well as ocean/tidal wave devices, will also benefit from the GST cut. The tax rate also applies to fuel cells for motor vehicles, including those powered by hydrogen. The GST on non-lithium batteries was reduced to 18% from 28%.

The landed costs for third-party solar open access projects increased in 11 of 15 states for high-tension industrial consumers, primarily driven by higher power purchase agreement tariffs, according to Mercom India’s Q2 2025 Solar Open Access Market Report. In Q2 2025, India added approximately 2.7 GW of solar open access capacity. This represented a quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase of more than 143% and a YoY rise of over 60%.

India imported solar cells and modules worth over $839.4 million (₹71.9 billion) in Q2 2025, an 8.3% YoY increase, according to data from the Department of Commerce. Solar cells made up 72.4% of the total import value, while modules contributed the remaining 27.6%. In a QoQ comparison, module and cell imports dropped by 35.6% from over $1 billion (~₹112.9 billion). While imports of solar cells rose 24.1%, imports of solar modules fell 71.5% in Q1 2025.

Maharashtra led solar open access installations in Q2 2025, accounting for 30% of the country’s capacity additions. Installations in the state rose 161% QoQ and 240% YoY, with nearly 59% of the projects delivered by three major developers. High grid tariffs drove several commercial and industrial consumers to opt for solar open access. The demand primarily came from consumers in sectors such as chemicals, fast-moving consumer goods, and textiles, which benefited from savings in electricity costs by switching to solar energy.

India added 44.2 GW of solar module capacity and 7.5 GW of solar cell capacity in 1H 2025, according to the recently released Mercom India research report, “State of Solar PV Manufacturing in India 1H 2025.” The manufacturing capacity additions in 1H 2025 were primarily driven by strong demand from the large-scale solar project pipeline of 186 GW between 2025 and 2027. Module manufacturing capacity also increased due to the 2030 solar installation targets and policy-driven domestic demand for solar modules compliant with the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

A delay of over 18 months in commissioning a transmission system strengthening program has created bottlenecks for evacuating 8.1 GW of power from a renewable energy zone in solar-rich Rajasthan. The Phase II (Parts E, G, and G1) transmission system strengthening project was scheduled to be completed in November 2023, but has remained uncommissioned, according to Grid-India’s ‘Operational Feedback on Transmission Constraints (April-June 2025)’ report. Several transmission project components, which were to be commissioned by November 2023 and September 2024, are yet to be completed.

Accelerating its push for creating domestic manufacturing capacities across the solar value chain, the government has proposed mandating the use of India-made wafers under ALMM starting June 1, 2028. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), in a draft amendment to the ALMM order, proposes creating an ALMM List-III for wafers, on the lines of solar modules and cells. Stakeholders are invited to submit their comments and suggestions by October 11, 2025.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy issued the National Policy on Geothermal Energy to advance research, exploration, drilling techniques, reservoir management, and cost-effective power generation, along with wider adoption of direct-use technologies. Geothermal projects will receive the same support mechanisms as other renewable energy sources under the policy, including interstate grid access, interstate transmission system, and open access charge waivers, as well as must-run status, renewable purchase obligation eligibility, and participation in the Indian Carbon Credit Trading Program.

The Ministry of Power has notified the Electricity (Amendment) Rules, 2025, introducing changes in the regulatory framework governing the energy storage systems (ESS) usage. In June this year, the Ministry proposed the amendment to permit the sale, lease, and renting of ESS. The rules amend provisions of Rule 18 of the Electricity Rules, 2005, with a focus on broadening the scope of energy storage utilization and ownership. The revised sub-rule (2) states that an ESS can be used either as an independent storage facility or as part of generation, transmission, or distribution.

The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission petitioned the Supreme Court to allow it to liquidate its existing regulatory assets over seven years instead of four years, to mitigate the impact of tariff shock to consumers. The petition follows a Supreme Court direction to all states to clear the pending dues of ₹1.74 trillion (~$19.72 billion) owed to distribution companies within four years. It had also said new dues created after April 1, 2024, must be liquidated within three years.

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy added a total of 4.8 GW of new solar cell capacity to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers List-II, taking the total enlisted capacity to 17.88 GW. Tata Power Renewable Energy has secured approval for a facility with an enlisted capacity of 280 MW/year. The facility manufactures bifacial mono-crystalline PERC cells. The enlisted model achieves an average efficiency of 22.89% with a wattage of 7.54 W, offering a range of 20% to 23.5% efficiency, corresponding to 6.6W to 7.75 W. TP Solar, a Tata Power subsidiary, has received approvals for two entries at its facility.

The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission issued a comprehensive framework for renewable energy transactions through the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission’s Terms and Conditions for Green Energy Open Access Regulations, 2025. The notification outlines the terms for non-discriminatory access to green power using intra-state transmission and distribution networks. The regulations are designed to facilitate the purchase, sale, and banking of renewable energy by consumers, generators, and traders.

The Ministry of Power prescribed a renewable energy consumption obligation for designated consumers to achieve a 43.33% target by the financial year 2030. The regulation specifies a minimum share of renewable energy consumption for electricity distribution licensees, open access consumers, and captive users. The target of 43.33% RCO by FY 2030 comprises 3.48% from wind energy, 1.33% from hydro energy, 4.5% from distributed renewable energy, and 34.02% from other renewable energy sources.

The Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) imposed antidumping duties up to 30% on imports of solar cells, whether or not assembled into modules, originating in or exported from China for three years. The duty imposition follows the conclusion of the antidumping investigation initiated by DGTR in December 2024. The investigation was initiated following a joint application filed by FS India Solar Ventures, Jupiter International, Tata Power Solar, and TP Solar. The probe was conducted for the period between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024.

Dries Acke, Deputy CEO of SolarPower Europe, welcomed the engagement of key European institutions on the issue but emphasized that meaningful progress requires concrete follow-up actions. He highlighted a recent joint letter from SolarPower Europe and the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), which proposed a roadmap to revitalize solar manufacturing in Europe.

The recommendations include revising EU public procurement legislation to favor EU-made content, launching an EU Solar Manufacturing Booster similar to the recently introduced Battery Booster, expanding State Aid rules to cover all segments of the solar value chain to prevent factory closures, and increasing the EIB’s support role for European solar manufacturing. According to SolarPower Europe, achieving the EU target of 30 gigawatts of annual solar manufacturing capacity will require investments of between €1.4 billion and €5.2 billion per year, and these measures can boost domestic manufacturing without relying on protectionist trade policies.

Ahead of the ministerial meeting, SolarPower Europe and the ESMC issued a joint call for a concrete action plan to strengthen solar manufacturing in Europe. In addition, 43 companies and associations from across the economy urged clarity in EU carbon accounting rules, recommending that Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and their Guarantees of Origin be consistently recognized in EU legislation. Supporting these efforts, a report by SolarPower Europe and the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (ISE) titled “Reshoring Solar Manufacturing to Europe” demonstrated that solar systems designed to strengthen supply chain resilience can remain globally competitive.

The discussions and recommendations underscore a growing European consensus that revitalizing domestic solar manufacturing is essential to achieving clean energy targets, ensuring energy independence, and creating sustainable economic opportunities. By combining policy, finance, and industry collaboration, Europe aims to strengthen its solar sector while building a resilient and competitive clean energy ecosystem.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/17.png,N,,2025-10-06 03:59:06.575700

America’s loss could be Canada’s gain in a world searching for trustworthy places to build the future energy system

Canada has been handed an opportunity it did not ask for. When the US Environmental Protection Agency moved to scrap mandatory greenhouse gas reporting, it did not just hobble climate policy. It undermined basic business infrastructure.

Every company tapping the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilisation and storage depends on credible measurement, reporting and verification.

Bankers will not finance billion-dollar projects on vibes; insurers will not underwrite storage liabilities without verifiable data; boards will not approve multiyear capital expenditure when the cash flows hang on numbers no one must prove. Pull that thread and the 45Q sweater unravels.

Bankers will not finance billion-dollar projects on vibes; insurers will not underwrite storage liabilities without verifiable data

Then came US President Donald Trump’s speech at the UN dismissing climate change as a hoax. He called it the “greatest con job ever perpetuated”, essentially holding up a neon sign that says, “global green capital: we don’t want your money”.

Canada should treat this moment as a competitive strategy problem, not a morality play. Markets reward jurisdictions that make risk legible and time predictable.

Trust over opacity

If the US chooses opacity, Canada can differentiate on openness and trust. That begins by treating emissions data like infrastructure: standardised, assured and available on a single, durable platform.

Imagine a banker in London or Singapore opening a Canadian project deck and seeing the same investor-grade emissions reporting across the supply chain, assured by third parties and tied contractually to incentive payments.

Now imagine that same banker trying to diligence a US project where the core revenue line — 45Q — has just disappeared. Where does cheaper capital flow?

Lack of credible data is not theoretical or limited just to CCUS. The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s carbon emissions disclosure rules are in a legal limbo, affecting all businesses negatively.

Multinationals with science-based emissions targets are already rationing suppliers on the quality of their data. If American inputs go opaque, Canadian paper and steel mills, miners and shipping companies that can prove their numbers become the safer choice.

Engineers and founders notice too. The places that win talent are the ones where work “counts” — where a tonne abated is a tonne paid, and where the rules will not change at the next press conference.

In a world of rising greenwash risk, trust is not a slogan — it is an asset you can amortise

The playbook writes itself. Keep the prose short and the contracts long. Make clear in statute that Canadian incentives — from investment tax credits to contracts for differences — pay only for verified tonnes.

Do not bury this in guidance; write it into law so a chief financial officer can model cash flows without guessing the minister’s mood.

Pair that certainty with permitting that rewards readiness: projects that arrive with credible storage geology and community benefits should move through predictable timelines. When companies show their maths, the state should show its clock.

Strategy, not compliance

For businesses, the opportunity is blunter still. Treat transparency and disclosure as strategy, not compliance. The companies that win the cost of capital race will be the ones whose emissions data could pass a sceptical buyside analyst’s test.

Publish a transition plan that ties capex to measurable milestones and link executive pay to outcomes someone outside the company can verify. The reward is not a gold star from activists; it is cheaper debt and equity, and preferred status in customer supply chains that need to prove their own numbers. In a world of rising greenwashing risk, trust is not a slogan — it is an asset you can amortise.

Sceptics will say Canada has its own credibility issues: targets missed, timelines slipped, increasing emissions from oil sands. Fair — but verifiable data is how you turn ambition into bankability.

Even imperfect trajectories earn investor patience when the numbers are consistent, comparable and assured. That is the point of making disclosure boring and mandatory: not to scold, but to lower the cost of capital and speed real projects into the ground.

So yes, Washington just made a mistake — twice. First, by weakening the data backbone that keeps 45Q investible, then by amplifying the notion that climate is a hoax, which tells capital markets that commitments are reversible.

Canada does not need to answer with bigger rhetoric; it needs to be the jurisdiction where the numbers add up in a credible way.

If we have measurements with verification, if we pay only for proven outcomes, if we lock the rules in place for a decade rather than a news cycle, the business will come. Not because we are nicer, but because we are clearer.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/74366c85-ca29-43ff-94a4-12d2d5172120.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 02:58:33.291526

For data center operators, securing a stable power supply has become crucial in the race for computational supremacy.","As AI and EVs strain the grid, The Williams Companies places a $3.1 billion wager on the future of electricity supply.

As the world marvels at the computational miracles of artificial intelligence, a pressing question emerges: Is there enough power to sustain this new intelligent era? The answer is now being written in the investment blueprints of energy giants. The Williams Companies (NYSE: WMB), one of the nation’s largest natural gas pipeline operators, is responding with a definitive “yes,” backing it with a $3.1 billion bet.

The AI boom and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles are placing unprecedented strain on the U.S. power grid, igniting an investment race centered on power supply. Industry forecasts project a 31% surge in national electricity consumption by 2030—a stark contrast to the mere 5% cumulative growth over the past 15 years. This tidal wave of demand, driven largely by AI data centers and EVs, is profoundly reshaping America’s energy landscape.

Seizing this opportunity, Williams is leading the charge. The company recently announced an additional $3.1 billion investment to construct two large-scale natural gas-fired power plants. Notably, the projects are backed by a 10-year, primarily fixed-price power purchase agreement with a financially strong customer, and are expected to commence operations by the first half of 2027.

Williams’ strategic pivot reflects a broader industry trend. Rival Energy Transfer is building eight gas-fired generation facilities in Texas, while Kinder Morgan has seen its backlog of natural gas infrastructure projects swell by $6.4 billion to a total of $8.6 billion. These moves signal a collective push by midstream energy companies into the power supply sector.

“We are leveraging our pipeline network advantages to deliver power solutions directly to high-load customers like data centers,” Williams’ CEO recently stated at an investor conference. The company currently has $1.6 billion of power projects under construction, capable of delivering 400 megawatts of electricity. The new $3.1 billion investment will boost its total power project backlog to $5 billion.

On the financial front, Williams offers a dividend yield of 3.06%. Analysts note the company has maintained a mid-single-digit annual dividend growth rate in recent years. A robust $14 billion pipeline expansion plan, extending through 2033, provides a solid foundation for continued earnings and dividend growth.

Industry observers see this power supply investment wave creating a multi-win scenario. For energy firms, it represents a strategic opportunity to break through growth constraints in traditional businesses. For data center operators, securing a stable power supply has become crucial in the race for computational supremacy. For investors, the steady cash flow generated by infrastructure assets is particularly valuable in the current interest rate environment.

As the 2030 power demand peak approaches, more energy companies are expected to join this supply-side transformation. Williams, with its first-mover advantage, is positioned to see the benefits of its early bets play out in the competitive years ahead.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/natural-gas-fired-power-electricity.png,N,,2025-10-06 05:00:17.367215

Nor do those suggestions demonstrate how such changes would fit into a coherent overall scheme for the future industry, or truly bring down soaring prices that are crippling households and businesses.

NZ First’s Shane Jones seems to agree, and recently called for his party to consider a policy of renationalising the big “gentailers” (the combined generation and retail companies). But his solutions appear designed to lock in dependence on fossil fuels rather than hasten the 100% renewable energy future that now beckons.

From the outset, it’s important to set clear goals for the electricity industry. Mine are: reliable abundant supply, and the lowest possible price to end-users, especially households.

Those were the goals of the old New Zealand Electricity Department, and they had been largely achieved by 1986. So-called reforms since then have reduced reliability while massively increasing prices and profits for the benefit of asset owners (including the government).

So, it’s also important to remember there are now entrenched vested interests whose incomes and asset portfolios are dependent on high prices and monopoly profits.

Bringing prices and profits down will mean writing down the asset values of the gentailers, the national grid and the lines companies – at the expense of their shareholders.

New Zealanders in general may be big winners. But there would be powerful and noisy losers. The sums involved will be large, and the politics will be difficult.

Rents and rising prices

Most of New Zealand’s electricity is generated from low-cost renewables – hydro, geothermal and wind – but also some high-cost thermal generation (mainly from the coal-and-gas-fired Huntly power station).

Before reform, the wholesale electricity price was set to cover the average cost of generation. Since reform, the wholesale price has been set by the highest-priced supplier, which these days mostly means Huntly.

That highest price is paid to all generators, despite the fact most of them will have offered to supply (and would have covered their genuine costs) at much lower prices.

As long as Huntly is kept in the mix as the highest-cost supplier that sets the market price, the market design will keep prices high – far above the cost of the solar and wind generation, whose entry to the market is being blocked by that same market design.

The result has been to enrich the owners of low-cost hydro and geothermal plant inherited from the old New Zealand Electricity Department.

From the moment this market mechanism was proposed in the mid-1980s, it was obvious it would drive prices up and deliver large rents (pure excess profits) on the legacy hydro and geothermal assets.

Equally, from the moment the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter’s cut-price supply contract was signed in 1960, it was clear that exceptions could be made. It was – and is – possible to impose long-term contracts to have electricity supplied to target groups of consumers at a low price.

In 1992, I and colleagues suggested how a contract similar to Tiwai Point’s could have provided 20,000 gigawatt-hours per year at two cents per kilowatt hour, to be passed through to consumers. The same contract structure remains an option today to lessen the burden of energy poverty on residential consumers.

However, what would have been simple back in 1992 was rejected as too “regulatory” by the head of Electricorp, which was overseeing the deregulation of the electricity market in the 1980s and 1990s. Now, it is politically hard because of the overblown asset values, dividends and tax revenues that have flowed from the high-price regime.

Worse, the first beneficiaries of monopolistic prices and asset values throughout the 1990s and 2000s have in many cases taken their capital gains and departed. The investors who bought their shares at high prices are now exposed to regulatory risk if the flow of economic rent is cut back.

Energy poverty and job losses

In 2012, in my submission to the select committee considering the Mixed Ownership Model Bill, I warned that future governments might find themselves forced to restrain anti-consumer and anti-competitive behaviour, which would push down the gentailers’ asset values and share prices.

I wrote then that this would “be financially devastating for the balance sheets of the companies, in precisely the same way as their conduct since 1990 has been devastating for the household budgets of millions of ordinary people”.

In the 13 years since, the conflict between monopoly profit and the public interest has worsened steadily, producing energy poverty for households and job losses in manufacturing, while asset values have soared.

Meanwhile, the arrival of energy-hungry computer data centres threatens to preempt any low-cost new generation that comes online.

Bringing down prices

Governments seem paralysed, both by their own conflicts of interest as owner-shareholders and by the prospect of backlash from powerful corporate and shareholder interests that benefit from the status quo.

Several broad solutions are straightforward in principle:

breaking up the gentailers

bringing in enough wind, solar, geothermal and battery power to remove the need for Huntly, even in dry years

and redirecting the legacy hydro assets to operate as a battery-equivalent rather than a profit centre.

But for electricity prices to come down significantly, the government would need to do at least these four things:

break down monopoly power and the sympathetic regulatory regime of the Electricity Authority and Commerce Commission

resurrect local electrical supply authorities to operate “energy communities”, combining the cost benefits of local small and medium-scale sources of renewable supply, with local network operators as coordinators

tender out procurement contracts for large-scale offshore wind, onshore solar and battery storage, owned and operated outside of the gentailers

and factor the true economics of renewable energy into the market by forcing the established vested interests to genuinely compete in the face of the renewables revolution.

Consumers and small business deserve a break after three decades of the current system. The outlook, alas, is for more of the same government fiddling while the economy suffers.

Entergy Arkansas’ plans drew recent scrutiny from the Arkansas Public Service Commission staff, the Arkansas attorney general’s office and industry groups like the Southern Renewable Energy Association and the Arkansas Advanced Energy Association.","With demand for electricity soaring, Arkansas utilities are looking everywhere for new generation possibilities, including up in the air.

Entergy Arkansas and the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. both recently put major power plant plans before state regulators, and both have connected new solar farms within the last 10 months. Entergy’s 200-megawatt Flat Fork Solar came online just last month.

But AECC also thought outside the box — or, rather, inside — to create 100 new megawatts of capacity at its Fitzhugh Generating Station.

It added two large turbines derived from the aerospace industry to increase the natural gas plant’s output from 170 to 270 megawatts.

“If you’ve ever taken a transatlantic flight, those large Boeing jetliners typically have very large engines,” AECC President and CEO Vernon “Buddy” Hasten said in an interview. “That engine hanging off the wing is made for the aerospace industry. If you take that same engine and use it to make electricity, it’s called an aero derivative.”

It was a crucial addition at a time when grid operators are requiring more excess generation capacity, new power-guzzling data centers are coming in and two giant coal-burning plants that Entergy and the cooperative co-own are set to either shut down or shift to other fuels.

“We basically took a 747 and tied it to the ground and turned it on and made electricity,” Hasten joked about the Fitzhugh expansion. “Actually, they are engines that General Electric has configured to make electricity. It was sort of like buying a power plant in a box.

“As a co-op, we’re always looking for bargains, and this was a good deal,” he said. “Maybe someone else couldn’t meet their obligations. The seller was really looking to sell.”

The utility further saved money by installing the big transformer from its decommissioned Carl E. Bailey gas-fired plant near Augusta to connect the new aero-derivative power to the grid.

The Bailey property is also the site of a 122-megawatt solar plant that AECC commissioned at the end of last year.

The co-op’s next generation proposal is an $800 million simple-cycle 850-megawatt gas power plant in Texas near Texarkana. Entergy also has gas-burning plants on the drawing board, including a 754-megawatt combined cycle combustion turbine near the White Bluff generating facility, to be called the Jefferson Power Station.

Entergy settled a Clean Air Act lawsuit by the Sierra Club by agreeing to stop burning coal at the White Bluff plant near Redfield by 2028. Under the 2018 consent decree, it will also stop burning coal at its Independence Station in Newark in 2030. Together, Independence and White Bluff supply Entergy, AECC and municipal utilities with a combined 3,500 megawatts of electricity.

That’s more than one-fifth of Arkansas’ net summer capacity of 15,000 megawatts as of 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Under a plan outlined to lawmakers and municipal utility leaders in Jonesboro and Conway, the Independence plant will continue generating electricity by converting to burning gas. The new facility will be majority-owned by AECC, which owns 35% of the current plant.

The city of Jonesboro would own 15% of the new operation, and Conway and West Memphis would have smaller stakes. The White Bluff plant would stay under Entergy’s primary ownership, and the utility is considering converting it to burn natural gas.

AECC hasn’t confirmed that the Independence plant will turn to natural gas. Spokesman Rob Roedel said that details “on the replacement generation source” are not available.

But Hasten explained that natural gas was basically the only choice for building a new baseload power plant quickly, like the one he’s planning near Naples, Texas.

“As you look at our integrated resource plan, it looks that way,” Hasten said in a witty 35-minute interview. Coal-burning plants are not being built today, he said, and new nuclear plants are at least 10 to 15 years away from feasibility. That’s why the power plant in Texas will burn gas.

“I get asked all the time. ‘Why Texas?’ Well, if you were a rancher, you’d be looking for good grass, good water, natural protection against predators,” he said. “The ideal location for this power plant is someplace with proximity to a natural gas pipeline, proximity to high-voltage power lines, and not right in the middle of an urban area. … We looked at many sites, and the Texas location is by far the most cost effective.”

It’s also in the footprint of Southwest Power Pool, a regional transmission organization whose market is requiring more accredited capacity from AECC.

2 Entergy Plants

Kristin Dalrymple, who became Entergy Arkansas’ vice president for business operations in March, offered some historical context to today’s resource planning crunch.

“The last time Entergy Arkansas really built units was when we built our coal units in the early 1980s and when we built Arkansas Nuclear One,” she said. “About 20 or 30 years after that, in a period when we needed new generation, we were able to acquire existing units.

“So now we are again in a period where there’s additional growth, but there’s also a backdrop where we’ve entered a consent decree to cease burning coal. So beyond our growth strategy, we have a replacement strategy to replace generation at White Bluff,” Dalrymple continued. “If you look at our last Integrated Resource Plan filing … you will see that we had a preferred resource plan that included a number of resources, and it also acknowledged that we were expecting to see growth.”

Earlier this year, Entergy won approval for a new natural gas plant to replace Lake Catherine Unit 4, which will close in 2027 after 50 years of service. The new 446-megawatt facility will bolster Entergy’s reliability and support load growth across its 730,000-customer footprint, the company said. It could begin operations in 2028.

Designated as Ironwood CT, it would be a simple cycle combustion turbine. Unlike the Jefferson design, it will not use combined cycle technology, which creates extra power by turning a turbine first by burning gas and then by using the exhaust to heat steam to spin a second turbine.

“In that filing for Jefferson Power Station, we talked about the benefits of combined cycle capacity to serve customer needs,” Dalrymple said. “It has an excellent load-following capability, and it’s an energy-efficient source of power.

“That doesn’t mean that we are necessarily shutting down the White Bluff units altogether. We are also evaluating potentially extending the lives of those units by converting them to burn natural gas.”

Taking a Hard Look

Arkansas utilities release formal resource planning documents every three years. Entergy’s integrated resource report came out about a year ago, and AECC submitted its plan in February.

The reports are complex, often running hundreds of pages, but they lay out how public utilities plan to allot resources to ensure reliability and stable costs to customers.

Entergy Arkansas’ plans drew recent scrutiny from the Arkansas Public Service Commission staff, the Arkansas attorney general’s office and industry groups like the Southern Renewable Energy Association and the Arkansas Advanced Energy Association.

The core concern is that the Jefferson Power Station doesn’t meet requirements to be paid for as it’s being built under the Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025.

The JPS project is the first in the state to be proposed under the act, which lets utilities apply a “construction work in progress” (CWIP) process to have ratepayers shoulder costs as construction goes along. Previously, ratepayers would foot the bill after new plants started operating.

Utilities argue, with some justification, that the CWIP process can save consumer money by reducing financing costs. But the new Arkansas law requires that new projects be tied to strategic investments to attract significant new economic development.

Arkansas PSC resource planning guidelines require utilities to ensure that any new generation projects serve the public interest and generally represent the lowest cost to ratepayers, though there are exceptions. Entergy calculated that the Jefferson Power Station will increase average residential non-fuel charges on electric bills by $2.85 per month.

Lauren Waldrip, director of the Arkansas Advanced Energy Association, said Entergy was trying to use the new process to pay for a plant that has “been in the works for some time” without justifying the switch from the traditional regulatory review timeline. “There are other concerns, one of which is that there’s no customer protection,” Waldrip said.

Entergy Arkansas is asking for retail customers to bear 100% of the JPS costs. “The PSC staff points out that for the project they’re seeking to have approved, the costs are unknown, and that the utility didn’t provide any benchmark against comparable projects. And the attorney general’s office filing says that Jefferson Power Station will drive significant ratepayer impact,” Waldrip said.

Simon Mahan, executive director of the Southern Renewable Energy Association, wrote in PSC filings that JPS does not meet the law’s definition of a strategic investment, and that it isn’t being proposed to serve a new large power user like a data center.

“[Entergy Arkansas] has known about the retirement of White Bluff for almost a decade, and has effectively waited until the last minute to announce public plans,” Mahan wrote.

Entergy spokesman Matt Ramsey said on Sept. 23 that the utility believes that the attorney general’s office and the PSC general staff actually support plans to build the Jefferson station. “All they were asking for is additional information, which we provided as of last Friday. This is part of the normal regulatory process, which is a key component that other media outlets might have missed.”

More than 25 state officials have written letters of support for JPS to the PSC.

“The governor, the General Assembly, the Department of Commerce and economic professionals from across the state have all said the same thing: Arkansas needs more electrical power to compete,” Ramsey said. “We are enabling the state’s vision to be an economic leader by investing in these resources.”

He pointed out that energy consultant Scott Norwood, who testified on behalf of the AG’s office, found that Entergy had demonstrated that it needs the power the JPS would generate, despite noting some “deficiencies” in the application.

Whatever happens in the JPS docket, Waldrip said regulators must keep consumers in mind.

“At the end of the day, we know that energy prices are going up,” she said. “We’re not naive, but we want to continue to make sure that mechanisms are in place to put some downward pressure on costs.”",https://arkansasbusiness.wppcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JBP_7607.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 05:00:55.649501

Phil Murphy’s administration.

In all, New Jersey has increased its green economy workforce by 12% since 2021, resulting in a gain of more than 6,000 jobs, according to the report from the state Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy.

Although the policy landscape has shifted in a different direction at the federal level, the nearly 140-page report projects there remains an opportunity for additional growth in this sector over the next decade.

More than 14,000 net green jobs are expected to be generated through 2035, according to the report.

Some examples of the green economy include infrastructure technologies such as water, waste, and wastewater treatment and management, as well as stormwater and resiliency infrastructure, administration officials said.

Clean energy technologies include grid infrastructure and storage, renewable energy generation and fuels, energy efficiency and alternative vehicles, the officials said.

“As the growth of our green economy adds thousands of family-sustaining jobs in New Jersey, this report will help guide our continued commitment to meeting the demand for workforce development and coordination across our educational institutions, unions, and training providers,” Murphy said in a statement issued along with the report.

Questions remain

The release of the report comes as New Jersey is facing some uncertainty when it comes to the trajectory of the economy and job market, even as the Murphy administration has been portraying the state as a regional leader in growth and economic development.

In the most recent jobs report, New Jersey’s unemployment rate ticked up to 5%, well ahead of the 4.3% national jobless average.

“Our goal is to continue ensuring every New Jerseyan has the opportunity to thrive in this emerging industry, transforming not just careers but entire communities as we transition to a more environmentally responsible future,” — Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner of the NJ Department of Labor and Workforce Development

Across the nation, clean energy jobs grew by nearly 3% last year, according to an annual report published by the Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) business group.

That outpaced the national rate of job growth more than three times over, adding nearly 100,000 new jobs to the national economy, the E2 report said.

“Since 2020, the sector has added more than 520,000 new jobs, growing 17 percent overall — much faster than the rest of the economy and far surpassing job growth in the fossil fuel, gas and diesel motor vehicle, and the rest of the energy industry,” the E2 report said.

With a total of nearly 63,000 clean energy jobs as of 2024, New Jersey ranked 21st among U.S. states, the report said.

According to the report released by the Murphy administration, a total of 130 green economy projects in New Jersey were funded through federal initiatives launched during the tenure of former President Joe Biden. These include the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

However, President Donald Trump, a Republican who took office earlier this year, has worked with a GOP Congress in more recent months to undo many of the policies enacted by Biden, including those related to clean energy and electric cars.

“Recent policy decisions to revoke energy incentives, cancel permits, and add additional administrative burdens to clean energy projects puts the continued growth of clean energy jobs in America at serious risk,” according to the E2 report.

For his part, Murphy, a second-term Democrat, has sought to improve New Jersey’s standing in the green economy, including by establishing aggressive goals for clean energy generation over the next decade.

But not all of these efforts have panned out, and Murphy is due to leave office early next year under term limits written into the state Constitution. It remains to be seen whether his successor will carry on the current administration’s environmental policies.

In all, a total of 12 different occupations could continue to see gains under Murphy’s push to boost New Jersey’s total number of green economy jobs, with electricians projected to see the most growth, according to the state report.

What the report revealed

Other high-growth occupations documented in the report are plumbers, heating and air conditioning system mechanics and installers and solar installers, according to the state report.

Among these occupations, most require only a high school diploma or equivalent credential. The report also suggests wages in high-priority green-economy occupations outpace the national average.

Earlier this year, the Murphy administration announced the availability of more than $4 million in Green Workforce Training Grants through the state Economic Development Authority to help develop training programs to prepare New Jersey residents seeking careers in the green economy.

The state report also identified opportunities to improve access to training opportunities for the green economy in southern New Jersey.

“Cultivating a skilled workforce has long been a cornerstone of New Jersey’s vision for sustainability, and the Department of Labor is proud of our ongoing success in developing clear pathways to employment in this area through strategic investments in education, training, and apprenticeship programs,” said state labor commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo, who also serves as co-chair of the New Jersey Council on the Green Economy.

Founder of NJ Outdoor Alliance discusses state’s energy needs

Says plan should balance environment, economy, affordability

NJ Outdoor Alliance endorses one gubernatorial candidate’s energy approach

New Jersey faces a crisis, not just rising energy costs, but environmental missteps and economic strain.

Skyrocketing utility bills, stalled offshore wind projects, and degraded marine ecosystems are the consequences of an energy agenda that prioritizes ideology over practicality. New Jerseyans are being asked to pay the price, literally and figuratively.

The Murphy administration’s Energy Master Plan sought to electrify transportation and home heating while phasing out in-state electric generation. In theory, it promised a cleaner future. In practice, it has delivered higher costs, reduced reliability, and environmental harm.

Offshore wind, the master plan’s flagship initiative, has become its most visible failure. Developers like Ørsted and Shell have abandoned multibillion-dollar projects off our coast. Ørsted canceled Ocean Wind 1 and 2 in 2023, while Shell wrote off nearly $1 billion from its Atlantic Shores investment. Taxpayers are left with the bill, and New Jersey is left with a looming energy shortage.

Meanwhile, ratepayers have endured utility cost increases of more than 20%, with another 5% expected by 2026. Families are cutting back on the very activities that define quality of life.

Why it matters

Outdoor recreation is more than a pastime — it’s a pillar of our economy. Fishing, boating, hunting, and wildlife tourism generate over $2 billion in direct retail spending and support thousands of jobs. Their ripple effect contributes $4.1 billion to our economy, sustaining marinas, hatcheries, seafood processors, guides, and restaurants.

When energy costs soar, these businesses suffer. Higher overhead and reduced consumer spending threaten livelihoods and entire communities.

The impact doesn’t stop at the balance sheet. Offshore wind survey work has raised concerns among scientists and fishermen over the disruption of marine ecosystems, displacing whales, dolphins, and fish from critical habitats. If offshore wind construction proceeds, seabed disturbance can bury clams, crabs, and other keystone species. Both construction and early operating turbines can alter the migration and movement patterns of marine life.

New Jersey should not be forced to choose between a healthy environment, a thriving economy, and affordable energy.

Jack Ciattarelli offers a practical, science-based alternative. His pledge to rewrite the Energy Master Plan is more than campaign rhetoric; it’s a necessary step to restore balance.

Ciattarelli supports a diversified energy mix – natural gas, nuclear, and solar – that lowers emissions without sacrificing affordability or reliability. He understands that economic vitality, environmental health, and energy security must work together, not compete against each other.

Energy price freezes may sound appealing, but they merely delay the inevitable, leading to steeper hikes when the freeze ends.

New Jersey should not be forced to choose between a healthy environment, a thriving economy, and affordable energy. With the right leadership, we can have all three.

What do you most appreciate about RFF?

I consider the people at RFF to be honest truth-tellers, and that type of dependable, nonpartisan research is more valuable now than ever. There’s so much misinformation out there. I love reading RFF reports on everything about climate and transportation decarbonization, especially on heavy-duty vehicles. I also think RFF’s work on critical minerals has been strong. The economic analysis that RFF contributes is unparalleled. I can’t think of anyone that tackles economic analysis with the rigor that RFF does.

Because RFF is nonpartisan, it doesn’t choose technologies, and it doesn’t choose winners or losers. Technology changes often, and something that’s popular this year might morph into something completely different in a few years. What RFF does is provide economic analysis of different technologies and their applications, and I think that’s incredibly helpful.

In terms of RFF’s value to my own work, I have a broad-based practice. I argue cases before state courts, federal courts, and the US Supreme Court, and I also do advocacy in Congress, with government agencies, and at the state level. It’s helpful to have RFF’s data so that I can advance my own position or argument. I expect RFF to be quoted in even more legal decisions in the future.

Finally, what do you think sets RFF apart from other organizations?

There are a lot of organizations that are conveners, but what stands out to me about RFF is that it produces economic analysis at the highest possible level. RFF truly is an economic analytical force in the world of think tanks today. It’s not an advocacy organization—it’s an honest broker doing careful work. I saw recently that RFF is rated as the number one think tank for energy economics, which doesn’t surprise me. I’ve always thought of RFF as the gold standard for economic analysis.",https://media.rff.org/images/Issue_219_-_Supporter_Spotlight_16x9.width-600.png,N,,2025-10-05 23:59:03.096529

Identifying Potential Renewable Energy Projects in the Local Community

The first step in fostering local capacity for renewable energy is identifying viable projects that align with community needs and resources. This process begins with a thorough assessment of the local environment, including geographical features, existing infrastructure, and energy consumption patterns. For instance, a community situated in a sunny region may benefit from solar energy initiatives, while those near rivers might explore hydroelectric options.

Engaging with community members through surveys or focus groups can provide valuable insights into their energy needs and preferences. Real-world examples abound where communities have successfully identified and implemented renewable energy projects. In rural India, for instance, villages have harnessed solar power to electrify homes and schools, significantly improving quality of life.

Similarly, in parts of Africa, wind energy projects have been developed in areas with consistent wind patterns, providing clean energy while creating jobs for local technicians. By leveraging local knowledge and resources, NGOs can help communities pinpoint projects that are not only feasible but also beneficial in the long term.

Engaging Stakeholders and Building Partnerships

Engaging stakeholders is crucial for the success of any renewable energy initiative. This involves identifying key players within the community—such as local government officials, business leaders, and residents—and fostering collaborative relationships among them. Building partnerships can amplify resources and expertise, making it easier to navigate challenges and implement projects effectively.

For example, an NGO might partner with a local university to access research expertise or collaborate with businesses to secure funding or technical support. Successful stakeholder engagement requires transparent communication and a commitment to inclusivity. Regular meetings and workshops can facilitate dialogue among stakeholders, allowing them to share ideas and concerns openly.

Involving diverse voices ensures that the project reflects the community’s values and priorities. A notable example is the partnership between NGOs and local governments in Brazil, where collaborative efforts have led to the successful implementation of community-based solar projects that prioritize social equity and environmental sustainability.

Assessing the Skills and Resources Needed for Renewable Energy Projects

Once potential projects have been identified and stakeholders engaged, the next step is to assess the skills and resources required for successful implementation. This assessment should encompass both technical skills—such as installation and maintenance of renewable energy systems—and soft skills like project management and community engagement. Conducting a skills inventory within the community can help identify existing capabilities as well as gaps that need to be addressed.

For instance, if a community is planning to install solar panels but lacks technicians trained in installation, it may be necessary to develop training programs or seek external expertise. Additionally, understanding available resources—such as funding opportunities, materials, and equipment—can inform project planning. A case study from Kenya illustrates this point: a community identified a lack of trained solar technicians as a barrier to implementing solar projects.

By partnering with vocational training institutions, they were able to develop a program that equipped local youth with the necessary skills, ultimately leading to successful project implementation.

Developing Training Programs for Local Community Members

Training programs are essential for building local capacity in renewable energy projects. These programs should be tailored to meet the specific needs of the community while also considering varying levels of prior knowledge among participants. A combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience can enhance learning outcomes.

For example, workshops that include both classroom instruction on renewable energy principles and practical sessions on system installation can effectively prepare community members for active roles in projects. Moreover, leveraging local expertise can enrich training programs. Inviting experienced practitioners from within the community or nearby regions to share their knowledge can foster a sense of pride and ownership among participants.

In South Africa, for instance, community-led training initiatives have empowered individuals to become solar technicians, leading to job creation and increased access to clean energy. By investing in training programs that build both technical skills and confidence, NGOs can help communities take charge of their renewable energy futures.

Accessing Funding and Resources for Capacity Building

Securing funding is often one of the most significant challenges faced by NGOs working on renewable energy projects. However, various funding sources exist that can support capacity-building efforts. These include government grants, international development funds, private sector investments, and crowdfunding campaigns.

NGOs should actively research potential funding opportunities that align with their project goals and develop compelling proposals that clearly articulate the benefits of their initiatives. In addition to traditional funding sources, innovative financing models such as social impact bonds or green bonds can provide alternative avenues for securing resources. Collaborating with local businesses or philanthropic organizations can also yield financial support while fostering partnerships that enhance project sustainability.

A successful example comes from a community in Bangladesh that utilized microfinance to fund solar home systems for low-income households. By combining financial resources with technical training, they were able to create a sustainable model that empowered residents while addressing energy poverty.

Implementing Renewable Energy Projects with Local Expertise

With funding secured and training completed, it is time to implement renewable energy projects using local expertise. Engaging community members in every stage of implementation not only builds trust but also ensures that projects are culturally relevant and sustainable. Local technicians who have undergone training can take on roles in installation and maintenance, while community members can participate in project management tasks.

A notable example is found in Nepal, where community-managed micro-hydro projects have been successfully implemented across rural areas. These projects rely on local knowledge and labor for construction and maintenance, resulting in increased ownership and sustainability. By empowering local experts to lead implementation efforts, NGOs can create a sense of pride within the community while ensuring that projects are maintained effectively over time.

Monitoring and Evaluating the Impact of Capacity Building Efforts

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) are critical components of any capacity-building initiative. Establishing clear metrics for success allows NGOs to assess the effectiveness of their efforts in real-time and make necessary adjustments along the way. M&E should encompass both quantitative data—such as energy output or cost savings—and qualitative feedback from community members regarding their experiences with training programs or project implementation.

For instance, an NGO working on solar energy projects in rural Mexico developed an M&E framework that included regular surveys of participants’ satisfaction levels as well as tracking changes in energy access over time. This approach not only provided valuable insights into project effectiveness but also helped build accountability among stakeholders. By sharing M&E findings with the community, NGOs can foster transparency and encourage ongoing engagement in future initiatives.

Addressing Challenges and Overcoming Barriers in Local Capacity Building

Despite best efforts, challenges will inevitably arise during capacity-building initiatives for renewable energy projects. Common barriers include limited access to technology, resistance from certain community members, or insufficient funding. To address these challenges effectively, NGOs must adopt a proactive approach that includes open communication with stakeholders and flexibility in project design.

For example, if resistance arises due to misconceptions about renewable energy technologies, conducting informational sessions or workshops can help dispel myths and build understanding within the community. Additionally, forming alliances with local leaders who support renewable energy initiatives can help sway public opinion in favor of projects. A case study from Tanzania illustrates this point: when faced with skepticism about solar technology among some villagers, an NGO collaborated with respected local leaders to advocate for the benefits of solar power, ultimately leading to widespread acceptance.

Sharing Best Practices and Lessons Learned with Other Communities

As communities successfully implement renewable energy projects through capacity building, it is essential to share best practices and lessons learned with others facing similar challenges. This exchange of knowledge can foster collaboration among communities and inspire innovative solutions tailored to specific contexts. NGOs can facilitate this sharing through workshops, conferences, or online platforms where communities can showcase their successes and learn from one another.

For instance, an NGO working across multiple regions might organize an annual conference where representatives from different communities come together to share their experiences with renewable energy projects. Such gatherings not only promote learning but also create networks of support among communities striving for similar goals. By fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing, NGOs can amplify the impact of their capacity-building efforts across broader regions.

Sustaining and Expanding Local Capacity for Future Renewable Energy Projects

Sustaining local capacity for future renewable energy projects requires ongoing commitment from both NGOs and community members. This involves continuous training opportunities to keep skills up-to-date as technology evolves and ensuring that local experts remain engaged in project management roles. Additionally, establishing mechanisms for ongoing support—such as mentorship programs or peer networks—can help maintain momentum within the community.

Expanding local capacity also means exploring new opportunities for innovation within renewable energy sectors. As communities gain confidence in their abilities to manage existing projects, they may be inspired to explore additional technologies or approaches—such as energy efficiency measures or hybrid systems that combine multiple renewable sources. A successful example comes from a cooperative in Brazil that began with a single solar project but has since expanded its efforts to include wind energy initiatives as well.

In conclusion, building local capacity for renewable energy projects is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning, collaboration, and ongoing support. By understanding community needs, engaging stakeholders effectively, providing targeted training programs, securing funding resources, implementing projects with local expertise, monitoring progress diligently, addressing challenges proactively, sharing knowledge widely, and sustaining efforts over time—NGOs can empower communities to take charge of their renewable energy futures while contributing meaningfully to global sustainability goals.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-10-06 01:58:50.872627

The point is not that Canada alone made Mars exploration possible, but that Canadian robotic mining innovation has already proven itself on the world stage.
Robotic mining is a national project — it requires continuity across decades, not political terms.","Canada has always been a mining nation.

Our identity has been forged in the toughness of the North, the endurance of long winters, and the resource wealth beneath our land. But today, toughness is not enough. To survive and prosper in a competitive, technology-driven world, Canada must move beyond traditional mining and embrace robotic mining as the foundation of its future.

Critical minerals — nickel, cobalt, uranium, lithium, rare earths — are no longer just economic assets. They are strategic imperatives, essential for clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing. The world needs them, and Canada has them. But without robotic mining, we cannot deliver them safely, sustainably, or competitively.

Why robotics is essential

Traditional mining is labour-intensive, hazardous, and environmentally costly. Robotics transforms all of that:

safety: robotic systems keep people out of dangerous environments;

sustainability: precision drilling, blasting, and haulage reduce waste and environmental damage;

productivity: automation enables continuous operations and higher ore recovery;

data-driven decision-making: AI and geospatial blockchain track every tonne of ore, every blast, every drill hole in real time.

Robotic mining is not a luxury. It is the only viable path forward if Canada wants to lead in supplying critical minerals to the world.

Lessons from Sudbury

Canada has already shown what is possible.

In the 1990s, NASA came to Sudbury to test whether robotic drilling could be trusted in extreme conditions. My team had developed tele-operated systems to modernize Canadian mines and protect workers underground. Those demonstrations proved that robotic mining works — and under some of the toughest conditions on Earth.

That capability gave NASA confidence to use robotic drills on Mars, where they ultimately helped uncover evidence of life. The point is not that Canada alone made Mars exploration possible, but that Canadian robotic mining innovation has already proven itself on the world stage.

From survival to leadership

Canada’s environment — vast, cold, and unforgiving — once demanded resilience for survival. Today, those same conditions can inspire innovation for leadership. Robotic haulage trucks, autonomous drilling systems, swarming drones, optical networks that transmit terabits of data, and blockchain-secured ore tracking are not abstract ideas. They are Canadian technologies, developed in response to our environment. What was once about survival can now be about global leadership.

Pilots that prove commitment

But bold rhetoric will not be enough. Canada must act by launching multiple robotic mining pilots. These must demonstrate safe, sustainable, automated operations across different mineral sites. And they must be built with broad support:

government ministries, to provide incentives and policy frameworks;

the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), to coordinate standards;

Indigenous nations, as partners in design, stewardship, and benefit-sharing; and

unions, to ensure workers are retrained and included in the next generation of mining.

Most importantly, these pilots must be insulated from election cycles. Too often, bold initiatives collapse when governments change. Robotic mining is a national project — it requires continuity across decades, not political terms.

A Canadian identity for the future

Modernizing mining through robotics is not just about minerals. It is about redefining Canadian identity. If we prove that mining can be clean, safe, and automated, Canada will not only be the world’s trusted supplier of critical minerals. We will also be seen as leaders in clean energy, defence readiness, and space exploration.

This is about showing that Canadians are not just polite and resilient — we are inventive, bold, and capable of leading in the technologies that matter most.

The choice before us

If we fail to modernize, Canada will be bypassed. Allies will look elsewhere for secure supply chains, and adversaries will continue to weaponize resource control. If we succeed, Canada can redefine mining for the world, turning our resource wealth and harsh conditions into a platform for innovation and leadership.

The lesson of Sudbury is clear: robotic mining works. The lesson of Mars is even clearer: Canadian innovation can change the course of discovery. Now we must apply that spirit at home.

The choice is stark: modernize through robotics — or decline. For Canada, there is only one path forward.

China is now showcasing its remarkable capacity for innovation, with its cutting-edge innovations increasingly setting the pace in multiple global industries.

Western narratives about innovation have long been shaped by a narrow historical lens that privileges recent developments in Europe and North America.

This perspective often dismisses the capacity of developing nations to innovate, portraying them as copycats rather than originators. Such a view overlooks the historical reality that China and India were the world’s largest economies and centres of innovation until the early 19th century.

From papermaking and gunpowder to advanced agricultural practices and astronomical instruments, China’s legacy of innovation is transformative and enduring.

The resurgence of Chinese innovation in the 21st century is not an anomaly, but a continuation of a long tradition, now reconfigured through top-down guidance, market competition and global integration.

China’s modern innovation trajectory began in earnest with its economic reform and opening-up in the late 1970s. Initially, the country leveraged its comparative advantage in low-cost mass production to stimulate growth. This strategy earned China the proud moniker “factory of the world”, producing goods for global markets without developing indigenous brands.

To sustain its industrial base and workforce, China adopted a pragmatic approach: imitating successful foreign designs and brands, in the footsteps of the Japanese industries in the initial stages of its economic recovery after World War II. The approach was not a sign of intellectual deficiency but a calculated move to build industrial capacity and technological expertise in the shortest possible time.

The turning point came in 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organisation, facing increased scrutiny over intellectual property practices.

Recognising the limitations of competing in internal-combustion engine technologies dominated by Western companies, Chinese policymakers pivoted toward electric vehicle, or EV, technology.

A special EV project was launched in 2001 under the nation’s 863 Plan, prioritising research in pure EVs, hybrid EVs, and fuel cell vehicles. This strategic foresight bore fruit when BYD introduced the F3DM plug-in hybrid in 2008, marking China’s entry into the global EV market. The 863 Plan is a top national high-tech development program initiated in March, 1986.

The US-China trade war initiated in 2018 further catalysed China’s innovation drive.

President Xi Jinping’s call for “high-level sci-tech self-reliance “spurred massive investments in high-tech manufacturing, artificial intelligence and renewable energy. Xi’s vision is not merely defensive but aspirational: to make China a global leader in emerging technologies.

The State’s role in this transformation is pivotal. Unlike Western innovation models driven by market forces and individual entrepreneurship, China’s approach is State-led, co-ordinated and systemic. Central to China’s innovation strategy is the “innovation chain”, a conveyor belt that transforms ideas from State-run laboratories and universities into commercial products.

This model has accelerated progress across multiple sectors.

In the EV industry, companies such as BYD, NIO and Xpeng have introduced groundbreaking innovations, including battery swapping, sideways motion and even flying.

While critics argue that the Chinese EV market suffers from overcapacity — with 129 brands competing in 2024 and only 15 expected to survive by 2030 — this “survival of the fittest” strategy has quickly winnowed down to a relative few that cannot only survive but thrive under fierce competition with their ever-improving technologies.

In AI development, China has made remarkable strides despite US export bans on advanced semiconductors. Domestic tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have mobilised to develop indigenous AI chips, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, exemplifies this resilience by training models on Huawei chips. This strategic pivot not only ensures continuity in AI development, but also fosters innovation within China’s semiconductor industry, laying the groundwork for long-term self-sufficiency.

China’s prowess in information technology is equally notable. Companies such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have redefined commerce, financial services and entertainment, often surpassing their Western counterparts in scale and sophistication.

China now leads the world in patent applications, a testament to its innovation capacity. This surge in intellectual property generation reflects not only quantity but also improving quality, as Chinese enterprises expand their global footprint.

In renewable energy, China has emerged as a dominant force. The country’s new renewable energy plan emphasises solar, wind and hydropower, supported by robust infrastructure and policy incentives. China is not merely adopting green technologies, but also shaping their global evolution. According to Harvard’s Fairbank Center, China’s leadership in clean energy is underpinned by strategic investments, supply chain control and technological innovation.

China’s innovation model diverges fundamentally from Western paradigms. In the West, innovation is often driven by free-market forces and individual actors — scientists, engineers, and investors — operating with minimal government intervention.

In contrast, China’s top-down model facilitates innovation through strategic planning, targeted funding and robust institutional support. A prominent example is Theseus, a computer-vision sensor company based in Chongqing that originated from informal partnerships between scientific researchers and local government officials. The enterprise was initiated through discussions among members of the Xi’an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, ultimately securing both financial support and infrastructure from district authorities. By 2024, Theseus had become a national leader in its field, collaborating with China Mobile to promote advancements in AMOLED display technology.

The integration of universities, local governments and industry is another hallmark of China’s flexible innovation strategy by adopting whatever configuration of partnerships works (the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping’s famous black cat-white cat winning formula comes to mind). Science parks and industrial zones facilitate the commercialisation of research and the emergence of new industries. Xiaomi’s rapid transition from smartphone manufacturing to EV production within three years exemplifies this agility. Moreover, China’s expertise in EVs and drones has enabled it to lead in the nascent field of flying taxis, showcasing the synergies across sectors.

As China consolidates its role as the world’s manufacturing hub, its aspiration to become a global innovation leader is a logical progression. Western scepticism about China’s innovative capacity reflects outdated assumptions and a failure to grasp the evolving dynamics of global technology. China’s State-led model, while distinct from Western norms, is producing tangible results across multiple domains. From EVs and AI to renewable energy and information technology, China is not merely catching up – it is setting the innovation pace.

Some of Texas' famed national parks, such as Big Bend and Padre Island National Seashore, will remain open during this time but may have limited staffing, according to Texas Public Radio (TPR).
During the last government shutdown, which began in December 2018 during Trump's previous administration and lasted a record 35 days, several of America's beloved national parks reported significant damage, including California's Joshua Tree National Park, which saw trees cut down and new roads illegally dug in.
The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has also called for parks to be closed, citing past problems during government shutdowns that led to vandalism, sanitation issues and ecological harm.","As Congress remains at an impasse on an agreement to fund government operations, several sites under the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt.

Across the country, parks have been forced to close, operate under reduced staffing or rely on outside donations to keep the lights on as the shutdown continues.

The lack of a unified plan across all parks and sparse details outlined by official government resources has sparked confusion about which places parkgoers can visit or if the shutdown has caused sites to temporarily shutter their services.

""National parks remain as accessible as possible during the federal government shutdown,"" a notice on the NPS website reads.

""However, some services may be limited or unavailable,"" it continues, with a link directing readers to a site with contingency plans outlining how funds would be appropriated during the shutdown.

A contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

""As part of their orderly shutdown activities, park staff will post signs notifying visitors that only basic or no visitor services, maintenance, or other management activities will be conducted, and emergency services will be limited,"" according to the plan.

At some park locations that collect fees, the memo stipulates that basic services can be provided such as those that maintain restrooms, collect trash and road maintenance.

But at some closed park locations, services will be stripped to the bone, including no trash collection, restrooms, road or walkway maintenance or visitor information.

NPR reached out to the NPS on Saturday for comment but has not received a response.

States step in and donations for some relief

Several states have taken it into their own hands to see to it that their parks remain open during the federal funding spat, either directly funding the sites themselves or collecting third-party relief to help keep the doors open.

According to National Parks Traveler, parks in states including West Virginia, Utah and Hawaii, have managed to secure funds and donations necessary to keep operations temporarily rolling.

Visitors in other states have not been so lucky.

Kathy Ten Eyck flew from Utica, New York into New Mexico to visit the glistening dunes of White Sands National Park. Instead, she was met with a notice of closure.

""I just couldn't wait — could not wait to — get here,"" Ten Eyck said. ""We stopped at the [PistachioLand] right up the street there, and that's where we heard that it was closed.""

Kathy Theriot was similarly heartbroken outside of the New Mexico Park. She had driven her children more than five hours from their home in Taos and hoped that they could experience the white sands she remembered from her childhood.

""I've been waiting 10 years to show my kids White Sands and the day we come it's closed, which is very disappointing,"" Theriot said.

""But it is really, really sad though that we get to the side of the road to enjoy part of our country because our elected officials can't get along.""

Vandalism and safety concerns

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

Some of Texas' famed national parks, such as Big Bend and Padre Island National Seashore, will remain open during this time but may have limited staffing, according to Texas Public Radio (TPR).

A previous government shutdown, TPR reported, saw an ancient rock at Big Bend vandalized amid the lack of staffing.

Those concerns have caused some park advocates to recommend all parks with a reduction in force be closed until federal funding is sorted.

""Keeping our national parks open after Trump and Republicans forced a government shutdown is stupid, short-sighted and incredibly dangerous,"" said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.

""We've seen the irreparable harm that can happen when our parks go understaffed. Vandalism, trash and human waste will tarnish natural treasures that are the envy of the world. But apparently nothing says 'Make America Great Again' like turning Yosemite into one giant toilet.""

During the last government shutdown, which began in December 2018 during Trump's previous administration and lasted a record 35 days, several of America's beloved national parks reported significant damage, including California's Joshua Tree National Park, which saw trees cut down and new roads illegally dug in.

The National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) has also called for parks to be closed, citing past problems during government shutdowns that led to vandalism, sanitation issues and ecological harm.

Centrica and X Energy’s £10bn deal could lead to the building of 12 advanced nuclear plants creating 2,500 jobs on Teesside and providing clean, homegrown energy for decades to come.

The PM recently created a Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce to capture this opportunity. Their interim report declared Britain’s nuclear regulation is not fit for purpose. The Taskforce was empowered to look at safety and environmental rules, but there was one area where they were forced to stay silent. Holyrood’s effective ban on the technology.

Why Scotland Is Being Left Out

Scotland risks being left behind. While energy policy is set at Westminster, planning rules are devolved. The SNP government has used its planning powers to impose an effective ban on new nuclear construction.

This position is hard to defend. The SNP claims nuclear power is too expensive, but that’s hardly a matter for the planning system. DP World, Centrica, and Tritax are all investing in UK nuclear projects to power data centres and industrial sites, clearly nuclear being ‘too expensive’ isn’t deterring them. Nuclear costs aren’t fixed either. France and Finland have built reactors for half the cost of the UK. South Korea builds at a sixth of the cost.

Crucially, Scotland cannot rely on renewables alone. Even in one of the windiest countries in Europe, the wind does not always blow. When Torness shuts, Scotland will lose its last source of zero-carbon baseload power. Without nuclear, the backup will not be more wind farms or batteries, it will be fossil fuels or imports from Norway. Fossil fuel prices have fluctuated wildly in recent years, and amidst rising energy prices, Norway has been threatening to cut off their interconnectors and will likely seek renegotiation to secure higher prices. This is not energy security.

Why the SNP’s Arguments Don’t Add Up

Nationalist politicians fall back on two arguments: nuclear is unsafe and nuclear is too costly. Both collapse under scrutiny.

On safety, the data is clear. Nuclear is one of the cleanest and safest energy sources available, safer on a deaths-per-unit-of-power basis than wind. Most of the fatalities associated with nuclear have come not from radiation, but from poorly managed evacuations, such as after Fukushima.

On cost, pointing to Hinkley Point C ignores international experience. France builds nuclear plants for half the UK cost; South Korea for a sixth. Regulatory reform and economies of scale can deliver affordable nuclear here too.

And nuclear vs. renewables is a false choice. We need both. Nuclear is reliable, compact, and provides power around the clock.

What Scotland Thinks

The SNP ban doesn’t just defy economic and engineering logic, it also defies public opinion.

A Britain Remade poll found 51% of Scots support new nuclear in Scotland’s energy mix, rising to 68% among those with an opinion. New nuclear is essential to meet the SNP’s own net zero target of 2045 according to 56% of those polled. Support for SMRs is even higher, with 77% of those expressing a view in favour of them.

Crucially, even those who voted SNP in 2024 are on board. A plurality of 47% believe nuclear is necessary to meet net zero and 56% of those who express a view back the construction of SMRs.

The Opportunity at Torness and Hunterston

Scotland already has the sites and the expertise. Torness in East Lothian and Hunterston in Ayrshire have hosted nuclear power for decades. They have skilled workforces, grid connections, and community support.

We’ve consistently found that support for nuclear power is strongest in areas where stations already exist or existed in the recent past. Britain Remade has tapped into this by drawing large audiences to pro-nuclear events in former nuclear communities. Across these sites, we’ve found a deep local pride in their nuclear heritage. In Dunbar, near the Torness station, we packed a hall with residents calling clearly for new nuclear investment.

UK ministers have made clear that Torness and Hunterston are prime candidates for new nuclear power if the SNP lifts its ban. Gigawatt-scale plants would mean billions of pounds of investment and thousands of jobs. Even SMRs would deliver hundreds of millions in investment and hundreds of new jobs.

In other words, these sites are ready to go, if only Holyrood steps aside.

Why It Matters Now

For years, the SNP’s nuclear ban didn’t matter. Westminster wasn’t building nuclear, so Scotland wasn’t missing much.

That era is over. Scotland faces a choice: embrace nuclear and share in the investment, jobs, and clean power, or stick with an outdated ban and watch opportunity flow elsewhere.

Investment is not just from taxpayers and bill payers. Technological progress means there are billions of pounds’ worth of private investment in SMRs available. This could power Scottish industry through the 21st century.

Torness alone has generated enough clean power to supply every home in Scotland for 36 years. Yet when it shuts, Scotland could be left with no nuclear power for the first time since 1959. At the very moment when nuclear matters most, the SNP want to lock it out.

A decade ago, the SNP’s nuclear ban was the equivalent of the London Borough of Lambeth declaring itself a ‘nuclear free zone’. Pointless, but largely costless posturing. Now Scotland is at risk of missing out on billions of investment. Scotland needs to change course, fast.

By Michael J. Hicks

October 5, 2025

Data centers have almost no local economic effects, with one possible exception.

That’s the result of my recent study examining the effects of data centers on Texas employment and incomes. Texas provides an ideal case study because it offers both property tax abatements and sales tax exemptions for data centers, it posts transparent data on tax incentives, and it experienced the data center rush before other states.

To understand the economic impact, I measured employment in counties with new data centers against those without, focusing on total employment and the sectors most likely affected: information, construction, and professional and technical services.

The results were pretty clear.

No data center had a measurable effect on employment. To double check that finding, we performed a second type of analysis designed to detect whether jobs come early, as in a construction phase, or later, once the data center is operating.

There was no evidence that data centers led to more employment or incomes. There’s just no effect at all, which is not terribly surprising. After all, these are not complex buildings. Much of the value comes from purchased equipment, not the structure. Also, there’s very little labor used to operate them after they’ve been built.

This Texas study offers data center proponents little evidence to justify attracting them in the name of economic development. But there is one potential exception.

Large data centers — those over 100,000 square feet — did appear to influence professional and technical employment. The average effect was reasonably strong, but many places experienced no effect. This finding suggests some future benefits, but it is far from definitive. It is difficult to know precisely how these very large data centers would differ from smaller ones.

The likeliest explanation is that smaller data centers support cloud computing, while larger ones are used for artificial intelligence. The AI facilities might bring with them technicians and engineering or computing staff in larger numbers. That would be a hopeful sign for the local effect of data centers, but it is a very tentative hope.

One finding was very clear. Statewide tax incentives for data centers are unjustifiable. It shouldn’t take an economic study to determine this. Large fiscal incentives for businesses without an employment effect have always been an especially dubious venture.

There’s no real support for local incentives either. But, in the rare case when there are economic development benefits, it will be very localized. Again, there is low probability of these incentives ever paying off, but that should be a local choice, not something taxpayers across Texas (or Indiana) should bear.

It’s also worth noting that, as part of this study, I tested the effect of data centers on electricity prices and price changes for residential consumers from 2010-2023. Again, there was no evidence that data centers led to higher residential electricity prices.

Indeed, the share of the family budget Americans spend on electricity has never been smaller than it is today. Any claims that data centers are driving higher electricity prices likely fail on a number of facts, not least of which is that inflation-adjusted electricity prices are low by historical standards.

Of course, this study only evaluated jobs and electricity prices through 2023 or 2024. There could be changes in the future, so it is best to keep an open mind.

Despite these results, data centers are important to our economy today and will grow in importance as data storage and the computing power of AI becomes more critical to household, government and business applications.

The big takeaway from this research isn’t so much that data centers aren’t a local economic benefit. I think even a modicum of judgment would make that clear. The lesson is that the rush to attract the newest fad blinded legislators, economic developers and county and city councils across the country.

Take Indiana, for example. In the coming weeks, the Indiana Economic Development Corp. is set to release a data center study. It’s worth reiterating: Any study that doesn’t attempt to assess the causal effect of data centers on local employment, wages and other economic measures is probably useless.

The IEDC’s work is unlikely to use rigorous experimental design — we don’t yet have enough variation in the location and timing of Indiana’s data centers to make such analysis possible.

Yet, Indiana’s first attempt at analysis comes more than five years after the state effectively gave the farm away to any new data center that wanted to move here. It’s part of the collapse of judgment that accompanied economic development policy in 2019 and 2020.

That failure cost Hoosier taxpayers billions of dollars and has saddled the Braun administration with many difficult choices. It is a case study on poor oversight, mission creep and a culture of accommodation to any business request for tax relief. In short, a very costly mistake.

The data center lesson should be simple. Do your homework on economic effects, be reluctant to give special tax deals and don’t wait until there’s a taxpayer rebellion to perform due diligence. Those are evergreen policy recommendations.

Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P.’s Quality Grades

Like the Value Grade, AAII’s A+ Investor Quality Grade comes from the percentile rank of key metrics. Specifically, the Quality Score is the percentile rank of the average of the percentile ranks of return on assets (ROA), return on invested capital (ROIC), gross profit relative to assets, buyback yield, change in total liabilities to assets, accruals, Z double prime bankruptcy risk (Z) score and the F-Score.

The score is variable, meaning it can consider all eight measures or, should any of the eight measures not be valid, the remaining measures that are valid. To be assigned a Quality Score, stocks must have a valid (non-null) measure and corresponding ranking for at least four of the eight quality measures.

The Quality Score is used to assess the underlying “quality” of a particular stock. A higher-quality stock possesses traits associated with upside potential and reduced downside risk. Backtesting of the Quality Grade shows that stocks with higher grades, on average, outperformed stocks with lower grades over the period of 1998 through 2019.

Stocks receive better grades (higher scores) for having higher scores for the quality subcomponents and worse grades (lower scores) for lower scores for the subcomponents.

Cheniere Energy, Inc. has a Quality Score of 81, which is Very Strong. Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. has a Quality Score of 60, which is Average.

The Quality Grade Winner: Cheniere Energy, Inc.

As you can clearly see from the Quality Grade breakdown above, Cheniere Energy, Inc. has a better overall quality grade than Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.. For investors who are looking for companies with higher quality than others in the same industry, Cheniere Energy, Inc. could be a good stock to add to their portfolios. However, it’s important for investors to analyze multiple factors based on a wide range of metrics before deciding whether to buy.

Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P.’s Momentum Grades

It’s important to look at a wide range of financial metrics in order to determine if Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline or L.P. is the better investment when it comes to estimate revisions.

Other Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P. Grades

In addition to Momentum, Quality and Estimate Revisions, A+ Investor also provides grades for Value and Growth.

Growth investing builds on the idea that stocks of companies exhibiting strong, consistent and prolonged growth outperform those of slower-growth companies. AAII measures growth through consistency of annual sales growth, five-year sales growth rankings adjusted for extreme levels, and consistency of positive annual cash from operations.

Successful stock investing involves buying low and selling high, so stock valuation is an important consideration for stock selection. Buying stocks that are going to go up typically means buying stocks that are undervalued in the first place, although momentum investors may argue that point.

These 2 key factors, when combined with the above, provide a holistic view into a particular stock. Further, by joining A+ Investor you can see whether Cheniere Energy, Inc., Plains All American Pipeline and L.P. pass any of our 60+ stock screens that have outperformed the market since their creation.

New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025.","A couple of years ago, a cross-section of Wall Street was highly bullish on the community solar sector, with some predicting that it was poised to become the most prevalent model of residential solar power distribution in the United States. First unveiled about two decades ago, community solar entails a small-scale solar model wherein customers purchase shares in a new solar farm in their service area, developers build the project then subscribers receive credits that cut their utility bills by ~10%. Community solar offers a viable solution to the roughly half of American households that are unable to install rooftop solar due to factors like roof shading, issues with property ownership or specific regulations. Further, these solar projects tend to offer friendlier contract terms for people with lower credit scores.

Unfortunately, the community solar boom could be over before it has even properly begun. A fresh report by global data, research, and consulting services provider, WoodMackenzie, has revealed that U.S. community solar installations dropped 36% year over year in the first half of the current year, with just 437 MW installed, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. OBBBA gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects, with the bill’s impact expected to get worse as the years roll on. WoodMac is now decidedly bearish on the sector, and expects community solar installations to contract 12% annually through 2030. Total U.S. community solar installations clocked in at 9.1 GW at the end of June 2025, and are projected to exceed 16 GW by 2030. Wood Mackenzie does not see much upside in the sector, and has predicted that installations could exceed the forecast figure by 1.3 GW on favorable state policy while further tax credit complications could lower the outlook by 1.2 GW.

“The final bill offers a crucial four-year window for projects already under development to come online and secure the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), supporting near-term buildout,” Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told PV Magazine. “As of mid-2025, there are over 9 GW of community solar projects under development, with over 1.4 GW known to be under construction,” she added.

Wood Mackenzie has attributed this year’s big decline to falling volumes in New York and in Maine, after the former program was recently overhauled. New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025. The analysts have noted that Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey are also facing similar problems as they transition between program iterations, adding that multiple states have generally struggled to pass new legislation.

Solar Stocks Shine

Nevertheless, solar stocks have been defying the bearish sentiment pervading the clean energy sector. Back in July, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, rolling back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. As widely expected, OBBBA is far from beautiful for various industries within the solar and wind energy sectors. However, the solar sector has continued to outperform, thanks in large part to robust U.S. and global solar demand as well as specific provisions within the OBBBA that favor solar manufacturing in the United States. The solar sector’s favorite benchmark, Invesco Solar ETF (NYSEARCA:TAN), has comfortably outpaced its oil and gas peers, returning 40.5% in the year-to-date compared to 4.2% return by the oil and gas benchmark, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE), and 14.8% gain by the S&P 500.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is one of the companies heavily favored by OBBBA, with the stock up 33.6% YTD. UBS recently reiterated its Buy rating and hiked its price target on FSLR to $275 from $255, saying the company will receive a significant boost to the bottomline from OBBBA credits. According to UBS, the present value of 45X tax credits for the company is worth $75 per share, while the company is expected to grow net cash to $25 per share by the second quarter of 2026. UBS says its PT is conservative, pointing out that it did not factor in extra earnings when First Solar’s finishing factory comes online. First Solar's 3.5 GW per year manufacturing facility in Louisiana is expected to be commissioned in the second half of 2025. This facility is part of First Solar's broader strategy to scale its American manufacturing footprint to over 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2025, according to Made in Alabama. The Louisiana factory, along with a new facility in Alabama, is are key component of this expansion.

Israel-based SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) leads the sector with YTD returns of 172.4%. Regarding regulatory changes under OBBBA, SolarEdge CEO Shuki Nir says the company’s multi-year strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. will help it preserve 45X advanced manufacturing credits over the next 7 years.

Meanwhile, some residential solar companies are also defying bearish projections. California-based residential solar company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) has surged 107.8% YTD thanks to the company’s robust cost efficiencies as well as a record 70% storage attachment rate in its latest quarter. Sunrun installed a record 392 MWh of storage capacity during the second quarter, good for a 48% Y/Y increase, while solar capacity installations clocked in at 227 MW, up 18% Y/Y. Meanwhile, subscriber additions grew 15%, bringing the company’s total subscribers to 941,701 as of June 30.

First unveiled about two decades ago, community solar entails a small-scale solar model wherein customers purchase shares in a new solar farm in their service area, developers build the project then subscribers receive credits that cut their utility bills by ~10%. Community solar offers a viable solution to the roughly half of American households that are unable to install rooftop solar due to factors like roof shading, issues with property ownership or specific regulations. Further, these solar projects tend to offer friendlier contract terms for people with lower credit scores.

Unfortunately, the community solar boom could be over before it has even properly begun. A fresh report by global data, research, and consulting services provider, WoodMackenzie, has revealed that U.S. community solar installations dropped 36% year over year in the first half of the current year, with just 437 MW installed, thanks to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. OBBBA gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects, with the bill's impact expected to get worse as the years roll on. WoodMac is now decidedly bearish on the sector, and expects community solar installations to contract 12% annually through 2030. Total U.S. community solar installations clocked in at 9.1 GW at the end of June 2025, and are projected to exceed 16 GW by 2030. Wood Mackenzie does not see much upside in the sector, and has predicted that installations could exceed the forecast figure by 1.3 GW on favorable state policy while further tax credit complications could lower the outlook by 1.2 GW.

""The final bill offers a crucial four-year window for projects already under development to come online and secure the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), supporting near-term buildout,"" Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told PV Magazine. ""As of mid-2025, there are over 9 GW of community solar projects under development, with over 1.4 GW known to be under construction,"" she added.

Wood Mackenzie has attributed this year's big decline to falling volumes in New York and in Maine, after the former program was recently overhauled. New York alone is expected to contribute nearly 30% of the U.S. decline in community solar installations in 2025. The analysts have noted that Massachusetts, Maryland and New Jersey are also facing similar problems as they transition between program iterations, adding that multiple states have generally struggled to pass new legislation.

Solar Stocks Shine

Nevertheless, solar stocks have been defying the bearish sentiment pervading the clean energy sector. Back in July, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act', rolling back many clean energy credits enacted by former President Joe Biden under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.

Farley, who spoke during a summit at Michigan Central Station in Detroit on Sept. 30, also outlined what Ford needs to do going forward to become a world-class profit-maker.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said as the federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases expires on Sept. 30, he expects EV sales to plummet in the next month, but he said Ford is prepared to meet what he sees as the new demand: hybrids.

Farley, who spoke during a summit at Michigan Central Station in Detroit on Sept. 30, also outlined what Ford needs to do going forward to raise its stock price and become a world-class profit-maker as he reflected briefly on his five-year tenure at the helm of the company.

Farley made the comments during his summit called Ford Pro Accelerate: The Essential Economy. There, some 300 leaders convened at the station to talk about ways to accelerate productivity across what Farley dubs as the Essential Economy: industries like manufacturing, utilities, transportation, construction, and energy. Ford spent nearly $1 billion renovating Michigan Central Station and both Farley and Ford Executive Chair Bill Ford said none of it could have happened without skilled tradespeople doing the work.

Bill Ford said he hoped the daylong summit, which featured Roger Penske, owner of Penske Automotive Group, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, along with CEOs of various large corporations, including Union Pacific railroad and FedEx, would result in some new ideas on how to better attract and retain skilled tradespeople to manufacturing professions.

The future of EVs

In a discussion with David Westin, host of ""Bloomberg Wall Street Week,"" Farley was asked about the future of EVs as the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used EV expires.

""Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting and fast, they're efficient ... but they're expensive,"" Farley said. ""We think it's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be way smaller than we thought especially with the policy change to tailpipe emissions and the $7,500 going away.""

Ford is working to provide EV shoppers with competitive lease payments on retail leases through Ford Credit until Dec. 31 to help with the transition off the federal tax credit incentive.

Farley told reporters that he expects there will be ""a period of time when we'll have to transition consumers out of the government's support. But as far as how long we do that, and how deep we do it, you know, we'll see.""

Farley said Ford's EV inventory is down given that the government set the Sept. 30 date for the tax credit expiration that all automakers built and sold down EV inventory toward. He said in a month, EVs sales will drop to 5% of the industry compared with 10% to 12% of the industry sales EVs are on pace for this month.

At that time, prices will probably go up, he said, ""which is also, you know, good, because right now they're artificially subsidized.""

Farley said Ford has learned that there are parts of electrification that customers find more interesting than Ford had initially thought they would.

""Plug-ins, special hybrids ... F-150 is now one-third hybrids, hybrid and F-150? Really? But now they can power your house for six days,"" Farley said. ""We think hybrids, EV plug-ins, E-REVs, those kinds of electrification, America's going to fall in love with and already is in love with.""

He said it means shifting Ford's product plans to make those hybrids in the factories that would have made EVs and that will require the work of skilled tradespeople in what he calls the Essential Economy.

For that reason, Farley is calling on federal, state and local government and community leaders to provide more vocational training and encouragement to recruit people into the skilled trades profession.

Making Ford a North Star company

On the sidelines of the event, Farley told reporters he's proud of the progress Ford has made as a company under his leadership, which is coming up on five years on Oct. 1.

""With restructuring, we got $1 billion of year-over-year costs down, which is a big deal. We've created a really good foundation as a company to create that North Star company that Ford really deserves, and it is going to take more work,"" Farley said. ""We need to get more capital efficient, we need to have higher margins than 4% or 5% and we need to be more resilient to economic cycles. To me, those three things are going to take a lot of work.""

Farley acknowledged one of his biggest challenges has been bringing down Ford's high number of recalls, which he called ""really difficult."" Ford leads the industry so far this year with 116 recalls, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Farley said getting Ford's quality improved was ""harder than I thought.""

""It took longer, it was deeper in the company,"" Farley said. ""There've been a lot of surprises but with a job like this ... I just didn't know where the surprises were, but I knew there'd be a few.""

Under Farley, Ford's stock price has risen close to 80% since he took over, which is good, but many analysts say it should be in the mid-teens to $20 range versus the $11 range it's in now. To buoy it will take getting Ford to be a North Star company, meaning a company that gets profits from a variety of revenue streams.

""We've got to work through a couple of these policy issues, and then that could be a big tailwind for the company,"" Farley said, alluding to President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""I don't think the market has understood the benefit of the EPA rule change and that's going to be big for our industry, for companies like Ford.""

Ford sells a lot of big trucks and SUVs so lowering environmental regulations will help it. Farley also said Ford has to get through Trump's tariffs on imported autos and auto parts, which are currently costing it an additional $2 billion in net costs.

""But we're working really hard with the Trump administration and that could be a tailwind,"" Farley said. ""But I think, longer term, people really want Ford Pro business to be what it could be, which is 30% of the profit of nonvehicle, we've never had that in the auto industry: That's parts, that's software.""

Farley said currently 17% of the profits from Ford Pro, which is the company's commercial vehicle business, come from parts and services and he believes it can hit 30% in two years.

Ford's success will also mean building out the ""emotional brands"" such as the Bronco SUV and Mustang muscle car to full lineups.

Finally, ""to take on the Chinese globally to prove that we can win against BYD in Australia and Thailand will be ... that's what the market's looking for.""

Other key points

Farley first addressed the essential economy in June during a discussion with biographer and historian Walter Isaacson (who wrote biographies about Steve Jobs and Elon Musk) at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado.

There he delivered a speech about appreciating the working class and why investment in the skilled trades is what he sees as the future of America.

Farley said on Sept. 30 that Ford hears from its Pro customers daily that ""they are suffering staffing issues"" and it is leading to a lack of productivity. He said Ford dealers are impacted, too, noting, ""This morning, there'll be 6,000 empty stalls in our dealerships with no technicians to work in them.""

He said he cannot stand people who just observe problems and it was time to bring together the best minds to solve the problems. Farley proposed on Sept. 30 that the solution to the problem is easing up permitting processes, spending more on vocational training and destigmatizing blue-collar work.

Farley said he had his epiphany during the UAW negotiations of 2023 when entry-level plant employees told him they had to work three jobs to make ends meet and ""the old timers were saying, 'It's no longer a career, Mr. Farley.' ""

Farley said while AI might take some white-collar jobs in the future, in the near term, the blue-collar jobs will be needed to build cars and factories.

He spent 17 years at Toyota, rising through the ranks in marketing and product planning before joining Ford in 2007.
As Ford targets profitability in its EV division by 2026, gemba could prove instrumental in identifying “waste” in battery production or software integration.","In the competitive world of automotive manufacturing, where electric vehicles are reshaping production lines and corporate strategies, Ford Motor Co.’s chief executive is turning to an unlikely source for inspiration: its Japanese rival, Toyota Motor Corp. Jim Farley, who has led Ford since 2020, has openly embraced a management philosophy known as “gemba,” a Japanese term that translates to “the real place” or “the actual spot.” This practice, deeply rooted in Toyota’s lean manufacturing ethos, emphasizes leaders physically visiting the sites where work happens—be it factory floors, dealerships, or even customer interactions—to observe problems firsthand and make informed decisions.

Farley, a former Toyota executive himself, credits this approach with helping him navigate Ford’s transition to an electric future. By going to the gemba, he says, executives avoid relying on abstract data or secondhand reports, instead gaining unfiltered insights into operational inefficiencies. For instance, Farley has recounted visiting Ford’s assembly plants to witness quality issues directly, which has informed cost-cutting measures and product redesigns amid the company’s push into EVs.

Adopting Rival Wisdom in Detroit

This adoption of gemba isn’t just a personal quirk; it’s part of a broader effort to modernize a 122-year-old American icon facing stiff competition from Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers. According to a recent article in Business Insider, Farley explained that “before you make a big decision, you have to go and see the real problem—where the waste is.” This hands-on method contrasts with traditional boardroom strategizing, echoing Toyota’s legendary Toyota Production System, which has long prioritized waste elimination and continuous improvement.

Industry analysts note that Farley’s strategy comes at a pivotal time. Ford has invested billions in EV development, including models like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, but has grappled with supply-chain disruptions and profitability challenges. By applying gemba, Farley aims to streamline processes, much like Toyota did to dominate hybrid technology decades ago. Reports from Yahoo Finance highlight how this practice is aiding Ford’s efforts to compete in the EV market, where rapid iteration and efficiency are key.

From Toyota Roots to Ford Revival

Farley’s background adds credibility to this cross-cultural borrowing. He spent 17 years at Toyota, rising through the ranks in marketing and product planning before joining Ford in 2007. This experience exposed him to gemba as a core principle, one that Toyota’s leaders, including current executives, continue to champion. A piece in AOL details how Farley is now instilling this mindset across Ford’s leadership, encouraging managers to leave their offices and engage directly with frontline workers.

The implications extend beyond Ford. As the auto sector grapples with electrification, supply shortages, and geopolitical tensions—such as tariffs that could favor Japanese imports—gemba offers a timeless tool for agility. Farley has even tied it to broader workforce issues, like the U.S. shortage of skilled tradespeople, as noted in related coverage from Business Insider, where he discussed encouraging his own son to take a blue-collar job to appreciate hands-on labor.

Challenges and Broader Industry Impact

Yet, implementing gemba isn’t without hurdles. Critics argue that in a globalized industry with remote work norms post-pandemic, physically “going to the gemba” can be logistically challenging for a company as vast as Ford, with operations spanning continents. Moreover, while Toyota has used it to maintain dominance in reliability and efficiency, Ford must adapt it to its own culture, which has historically emphasized bold innovation over incremental tweaks.

Looking ahead, Farley’s embrace of this Toyota tactic signals a humility rare in Detroit’s executive suites, potentially setting a precedent for other legacy automakers. As Ford targets profitability in its EV division by 2026, gemba could prove instrumental in identifying “waste” in battery production or software integration. Insights from BizToc suggest this approach is already yielding decisions that prioritize real-world problem-solving over theoretical models, positioning Ford to better rival not just Toyota, but the influx of nimble EV startups.

Both parties have something the other wants, but without ever working to reach an agreement with you, the seller hands you a contract far exceeding the original asking price, and says “sign here,” and if you don’t, they set the house on fire and blame you for arson.

This take-it-or-leave-it attitude is what led to the shutdown of the federal government when it ran out of money on Oct. 1.

Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and instead of working in a bipartisan way to avert a shutdown, they chose a strategy that guaranteed one. Shutdowns are harmful, costly, and disruptive. Because Republicans know that Democrats care deeply about our federal workforce and communities, they thought they could shove a contract in our face and force us to sign a blank check for Donald Trump.

There was no way I could support their partisan spending bill. I’d like to explain why and what else is at stake.

The House Republican strategy all year has been to “go it alone” because they control the House and have the majority required to pass laws and funding bills. The Republican majority in the Senate, however, needs a handful of Democratic votes to pass a Continuing Resolution to fund the government because of the filibuster. Instead of collaborating with Democrats to pass a short-term bill that both parties could agree to, Senate Republicans pushed the contract across the table to Senate Democrats and said, “sign here.”

This impasse is about your health care and about Trump following the law.

For months, Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the health care crisis Republicans created when they slashed funding for Medicaid. It’s about to get worse with the expiration of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits that make health insurance affordable for millions of Americans. Without those tax credits, many Americans who buy their health insurance through the ACA won’t be able to afford coverage. Those tax credits expire at the end of the year unless Congress acts quickly to renew them.

In Texas, renewal notices will soon go out, and if allowed to expire, 92,000 El Pasoans will see their premiums skyrocket, and half will lose their health care altogether. Data provided by the House Budget Committeeshows that in El Paso, for a family of four earning $129,800, their premiums will increase by $9,073 (86%). A family of four earning $64,000 a year will see their premiums increase by $2,571 (263%), and for a 60 year-old couple earning $82,800 a year, their annual premiums will increase by $17,290 (265%).

Congress can prevent this. Americans are already paying more for groceries because of Trump tariffs and higher utility costs because of Trump and Republicans’ cancellation of clean energy subsidies. Layer that on top of these soon-to-be soaring insurance costs and millions of Americans — including thousands of El Pasoans — will be plunged further into economic crisis.

This will create real suffering for people in our community. Cancer patients, expectant moms, people with chronic health conditions will lose their insurance because they can’t afford it, and it will be nearly impossible for them to access the health care they need.

Republicans continue to spread the lie that Democrats are fighting for free health care for undocumented people. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and they are also ineligible for Medicaid, Medicare and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

Secondly, Democrats want language in the funding to require Trump to follow the law and administer the funds as Congress directed. He cannot simply end programs, move money or fire people as he has been doing. As one of my Republicans colleagues, Rep. Steve Womack said: “If you’re a Democrat — even just like a mainstream Democrat — your predisposition might be to help negotiate with Republicans on a funding mechanism. Why would you do that if you know that whatever you negotiate is going to be subject to the knife pulled out by Russ Vought?” (Vought is Trump’s Office of Management and Budget Director, and author of Project 2025).

These are not normal times. Normally, both sides come together to agree on a bill and avoid a shutdown. That didn’t happen, and it needs to immediately.

None of this makes the pain of a shutdown easier, and my team and I worked to create a resource page for the public and federal employees with information we hope is helpful. Among the resources are zero-interest loans to furloughed federal employees through many of our local credit unions, as well as resources from utility companies. Our offices in El Paso and Washington will remain open to help constituents with federal agencies and other issues that arise during a shutdown. To view my full resource page, please visit escobar.house.gov/shutdown.

It is my hope that Republicans recognize that Americans are hurting, the economy is not doing well, and forcing Americans off their health care will exacerbate the economic crisis hard-working citizens are living through. And I hope those Republicans who privately complain about Trump’s illegal funding cuts will find the courage to stand up with us for the constitution.

Republicans control all of government, and their “go-it-alone” strategy is not appropriate. It’s time for bipartisan compromise.

After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day.
The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.
Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities.","The Trump administration is canceling about $8 billion in grants for energy projects in mostly Democratic-led states — but is allowing funding to continue for similar projects in states that voted for Trump.

The canceled grants, which were first announced last week by the Office of Management and Budget’s director, Russell Vought, don’t total anywhere close to all of the energy investments made by the Biden administration, which Vought called “Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

For now, energy project money appears to be continuing to flow to companies and institutions located in red and swing states, even though the work these institutions are doing is very similar to the work that was cut, according to a NOTUS analysis of hundreds of projects across the country, including the latest cancellations.

For example, the administration canceled $460 million in funding for the Democrat-led state of Minnesota to build much-needed interregional transmission lines (power lines that connect the country’s separated parts of the grid).

It left in place a $700 million grant from the same program that will connect the Eastern and Western U.S. grids in Montana, a state that voted for Trump and is led by Republicans.

The administration also canceled funding to improve the resilience of the power grid in Hawaii from wildfires and other extreme weather, as well as $40 million in funding for a project to build a resilient backup microgrid for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and the island of Oahu.

It did not cut the $160 million that was awarded in the same funding round from the same program for Georgia Power to make the state’s electric grid more resilient.

And of the 17 projects the Department of Energy awarded for battery recycling and reprocessing innovations, the list of cuts included just three: one in Colorado and two in California.

There’s no obvious difference between those three projects and the remaining 14 that appear to still be funded, beyond the fact that some of the others are located at national labs or in states that either voted for Trump or are led by Republicans, like Utah, Virginia, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

And while the administration canceled billions in funding for hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, hubs that touch states including Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana appear fine for now.

The specific cuts suggest the Trump administration is using its grant authorities to pressure Democrats to vote for the government funding bill. There is discussion on the Hill between some Democrats and Republicans in the states affected by the cuts about pushing for a restoration of the funds as part of a deal to end the shutdown, one source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt suggested as much to Fox News last week when asked about the program cuts.

“Pass the clean, continuing resolution and all of this goes away,” she said, directed at Democrats.

But just hours later, Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that a reversal of the cuts was not on the table. In an interview on CNN on Thursday night, he said that the decision to cancel the funding had nothing to do with the shutdown.

When asked about why the affected projects were all in states that voted for Kamala Harris last November, Wright denied that the administration was targeting Democrats and said that more cancellations were coming down the pipe — including in red states. “This is a partial list of an ongoing process. More project announcements will come,” he said.

The Trump administration’s announcement sowed confusion for the companies and states affected. After Vought announced Wednesday that about $8 billion in energy cuts were coming, the affected states did not receive notice of any official cuts until the following day. Some local authorities said they have still not received official notice from the DOE, including the state of Colorado and the California Energy Commission.

Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said he had lunch with Energy Secretary Chris Wright “minutes before” the cancellations were announced, but received no warning.

“He had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included 10 projects in my state, projects that affect real jobs and real families,” Heinrich said in a statement. “That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions.”

The grant cancellations span projects aimed to improve electrical grid infrastructure, innovate on battery recycling, create new forms of energy storage, lower buildings’ energy usage and advance hydrogen and fuel cell technology. Many of the projects would carry benefits and jobs outside of the states they are based in, especially those that would affect the resilience and performance of the nation’s aging electric grid.

A number of recipients are losing multiple projects, including some institutions whose goals could serve the Trump administration’s interests. GTI Energy, which is focused on modernizing the natural gas industry, lost 13 grants. Both GE Vernova, a maker of wind and gas turbines, and the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit electricity research organization, lost 11. The University of Illinois, which has several energy research projects funded by the DOE, lost eight.

Many of the projects on this list have already begun operations, which means the money that has been distributed for these projects so far will be wasted if operations halt, another source familiar with the situation told NOTUS.

Lindsay VanLaningham, a spokesperson for the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a community-owned electric utility, said in a statement to NOTUS that as of Thursday evening, the DOE had not yet notified them of any changes to their grant, which funds “a portion of a project already in flight.”

Some of the canceled awards are listed by the Energy Department as targeting blue states, but the impacted projects themselves are located in red states. For instance, a $19.7 million federal award to IBM related to methane emissions research is categorized under awards cancelled to entities New York — but a description of the project published in 2024 said it will be carried out entirely in Western states that voted for Trump, including Utah, Montana and Alaska.

There are more areas for confusion: The list of cancellations includes some, but not all, grants that the DOE first announced in May that it was canceling, primarily for clean energy industrial demonstrations.

And some of the affected entities are getting information that conflicts with the DOE news release. The department says entities have 30 days to appeal the cancellations, but one affected group told NOTUS their instructions say they have only 10 days to appeal.

Some of the DOE cuts also appear to go against stated Trump administration priorities. For example, the administration has issued executive orders and memos emphasizing the importance of mineral development and extraction in the United States. Recycling used batteries is one way to increase the availability of minerals and metals like lithium, but three of the grants in that program have been axed.

Some companies have confirmed with NOTUS that they are now receiving cancellation notices. Those include Smartville, a Carlsbad, California-based company that was building a long-duration battery storage project, and Sublime Systems, which was originally told in May its grants had been cancelled and has been in the appeals process since then.

“Regardless of the political fighting in Washington, D.C., hydrogen remains a viable product for energy dominance and represents a market worth hundreds of billions of dollars that generates millions of jobs. While we are disappointed in the Department of Energy’s decision to cut funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, there is still immense opportunity for our region to finish what we started,” a spokesperson for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen hub said.

Tags: climate change, pollution,","PITTSFIELD, Mass. — Climate activists are demanding that top polluters pay for their impact on the environment.

In late September, community members and elected officials gathered at the Westside Riverway Park for a ""Bridges to the Future"" event, featuring state Sen. Paul Mark, state Rep. Tricia Farley-Bouvier, and grassroots organizations from across the region.

""We're here to meet and learn about the awesome work that incredible change makers in this community are already doing to not only educate community members about the impacts of climate change, but are also doing the necessary work on the ground to help keep our communities safe from what is currently happening and what will only get worse,"" said Rachael Boyce, co-lead of the Massachusetts Make Polluter's Pay campaign.

""Especially in the face of the federal government that is withdrawing funds that are meant to keep our communities safe.""

The Climate Change Superfund bill, or the Make Polluters Pay, would require the worst carbon emitters to pay for climate-related damages through a superfund. This is expected to generate billions of dollars over 25 years to be spent on projects that protect communities from the effects of climate change.

""As we have this political chaos at the federal level. This is a great reminder that we have a tremendous amount of power to enact real change on the local level,"" Boyce said.

""It does not matter who is in the White House.""

She explained that there is not nearly enough money for the work that needs to be done, and policy solutions that have come forward ultimately fall on the taxpayer. Make Polluters Pay intends to fill the gap between resilience, adaptation, and mitigation work being done now and what needs to be done in the future.

""These are the world's top fossil fuel companies that have made trillions off the extraction and exploitation of our environment, and we are paying to clean up their mess,"" Boyce said.

""They will pay into this fund. It will cover, we're thinking, at minimum, $75 billion over the next 25 years to pay for climate adaptation and mitigation projects across the state, to help bolster the work that is already happening in your communities, as you're about to hear about today.""

There were presentations from the Berkshire Environmental Action Team's Breathe Easy Berkshires air quality monitoring program, Greenagers environmental stewardship program, the Housatonic Valley Association, and 350 Mass Berkshire Node, and Sunrise Movement activists from Smith College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

""One of the problems with fossil fuel pollution, that we're finding is the most prevalent, whether it's from vehicles or from things like power plants, is particulate matter,"" Rosemary Wessel, of BEAT, explained while detailing the Breathe Easy Berkshires air quality monitoring program being conducted in Pittsfield.

""Particulate Matter is little specks of material that come when you burn fossil fuels, and there's this one type called PM 2.5, it's actually 2.5 microns, and that's small enough that it can get into the nasal passages, down into the lungs, and into the bloodstream. So it not only affects your lungs, but it can get into the bloodstream and get to other organs, and it starts to have some real consequences, especially over time. It's just a fraction of the width of a human hair.""

Erik Reardon, of the Housatonic Valley Association, pointed to the $20 million removal of the Bel Air Dam as an example of the price tag on climate resilience projects. He also cited the 2023 torrential flooding in North Adams that caused more than $4 million in damage to upwards of 20 streets and roads.

He cautioned, ""Flooding isn't just a distant worry. It's happening here in Berkshire County, and it's happening with increasing frequency.""

""Unfortunately, part of what makes the Berkshire so special also tends to make us uniquely vulnerable in our geography, our topography. We have steep hillsides of the Taconic mountains to our west, with the Berkshire hills to our east,"" Reardon explained.

""During major storm events, these headwater streams rise, they fill up, they flow down into valley bottoms, where a lot of our towns and communities are located, and we've been, for about two centuries, meddling with the course of rivers as well. We've been straightening them. We've been disconnecting them from their floodplains. That tends to make them less resilient, less able to naturally store and absorb flood water, and so much of our infrastructure, our roads, our culverts, our dams, were built for storms of the past. They are not ready for the climate reality that we know we are facing today.""

He pointed to nature-based solutions such as reconnecting floodplains, stabilizing river dams, and keeping culverts and bridges in good shape. While partnering with local towns, HVA has found that a new, 10-foot culvert costs around $800,000.

Legislators pushed for homegrown solutions in Massachusetts, citing federal uncertainties.

Mark said the idea now is to invest in the next four to eight years, ""invest in ourselves, invest in our future, and invest in our sustainability.""

""The federal government has abdicated its responsibility to pretty much everything, but certainly to progress in the environmental sector and in sustainability and green jobs and renewable energy. And it's a problem, and it's probably a bigger problem than we all realize,"" he said, explaining that the best-case scenario the United States can hope for is that more climate-friendly candidates win seats in Congress next year.

""... The best we can hope for is three years of less harm happening, because nobody federally is going to be helping us at all. And so the problem with that is, assuming this administration does end in four years and someone more committed to our future and our green renewable future takes office, they're still going to have a lot of work to do to get us back on track so we've been set back at least six to 12 years, and we have to think seriously about what that means all of us as a community, and then all of us in state government specifically.""

In Massachusetts, if the federal government is no longer a reliable partner, Mark said that doesn't mean the commonwealth will give in or give up. He explained that Massachusetts knows what it cares about from a philosophical, political, and ideological point of view, and how to have a healthy, green, sustainable state.

""Over the last couple of years, we have seen so often climate events that have become more and more frequent happening, and they're happening here in Western Massachusetts, where most of the communities I represent do not have the resources on their own to make a difference, to make an impact without significant help,"" he said.

""So the more we can do as a commonwealth, as a state of Massachusetts, to take ownership on our own and make sure we're doing the right thing, the more important it can be.""

He cited Pittsfield's pollution from General Electric's former presence as a classic example of why the Climate Superfund is important.

""They took what they wanted, they polluted what they wanted, and they left. And there's been some recourse, and there's been some ability to hold them accountable, but for the most part, we've been on our own,"" Mark said.

""We can't allow that to happen. We need the people that are causing this, the organizations that are causing this, to be partners into the short, medium, and long term, on helping make sure that we are able to sustain our own infrastructure, our own future, and our own energy future as well.""

He has been working on legislation to establish a Green Bank so there is funding available for renewable projects.

Farley-Bouvier added, ""We're pretty sick and tired of having people make bajillions of dollars and then we have to clean up their messes, and that's what this bill does,"" speaking about the Make Polluters Pay bill.

She pointed to increasing environmental disasters and extreme weather events happening as a result of climate change, explaining that people have profited from causing it.

""And so this is something that we are doing to reduce it,"" she said.

""We are not relying on the federal government to send us those dollars to do it, but we're we have homegrown solutions here in Massachusetts, so for that, that's why this bill does make a lot of sense.""

The event was hosted by the Make Polluters Pay campaign, in partnership with BEAT, 350 Mass Berkshire Node, Housatonic Valley Association, and Food & Water Watch.

A Celebration of Life will be held on Sunday, November 2 at 2:00 pm at the Armitage Educational Center located in the Kansas University Field Station. All who knew and loved Ed are encouraged to attend.

Ed was the retired Director of KU's Biological Survey and Professor of Biology. In his capacity as Director, he provided excellent leadership and support to many scientists focused on ecological research on environmental problems. Ed gave expertise in places around the world including University of New England in Australia. Nationally in the USA he worked at NASA and the US Environmental Protection Agency. In Kansas, he served as President of the Entomological Society and the Kansas Water Authority. At KU, he served on 20 committees. He would be most pleased and remembered for the contribution he made to bringing the Field Station to maturity. It is now open to the public and does amazing programming for all ages but especially schoolchildren.

Ed was the Primary Investigator and author of over 100 research grants that provided KU and the State of Kansas with over twenty-one million dollars. He also had over 100 presentations and written articles. Many of these were about his interest and expertise in remote sensing in agriculture and preservation of natural resources. Ed was the recipient of many awards for his contributions to various professional endeavors.

Ed was born in August 1945 in Colorado Springs. His boyhood and K-12 education were spent there, graduating from Wasson High School. While growing up he enjoyed singing in various choirs and playing the accordion. And won prizes for his accordion playing. Upon graduating from Wasson High, Ed decided to exchange his home in the mountains for the Flint Hills of Kansas. He used his Merit Scholarship to attend College of Emporia, a small Presbyterian liberal arts school. He majored in biology and was also active in singing, travelling around the country with the C of E Chorale. Four years later he returned to his home state, to work on a master's degree in biology at University of Colorado. After receiving his MS degree, he received a graduate fellowship to begin work on a doctorate in biology at KU. Soon, he received his Ph.D. in Biology and began a lifelong academic career at the University of Kansas.

On May 28, 1977, a day he considered ‘the best day of my life’ he married Nancy Hale, a Lawrence native. They remained a ‘dynamic duo minus the capes’ travelling the world together until Nancy's death in 2021. They had many friends in Lawrence. They had very special friends, Paul and Stacey in Kentucky, Bob and Alice, as well as Jerry and Gwen in Tennessee who will miss Ed. He is survived by a sister, Patricia, Nephew Joe and Niece Julie, and Nancy's brother Ken.

The incident was one of the most perilous events in the refinery’s 114-year history, adding to a long list of environmental and safety violations, according to public records reviewed by The Times.
But, for the Chevron refinery explosion, there is no guarantee such an investigation will take place.
The Trump administration proposed eliminating the budget for the Chemical Safety Board this fiscal year, starting Oct. 1, sunsetting the 27-year-old federal agency.
OSHA records show the agency conducted at least 15 inspections at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo over the last decade, identifying 17 violations.","The explosion and hours-long fire at Chevron’s refinery Thursday night in El Segundo deeply unnerved communities in the South Bay.

The blast sent shock waves throughout the refinery grounds, allegedly injuring at least one worker, and jolting residents as far as a mile away. A 100-foot-tall pillar of fire cast an orange glow over the night sky. And towering plumes of smoke and acrid odors drifted eastward with the onshore winds.

While local regulators are investigating the fire, environmental advocates lament that federal safety agencies likely won’t be joining in the effort to find the cause of Thursday’s explosion — perhaps preventing similar hazardous chemical releases in the future. The incident was one of the most perilous events in the refinery’s 114-year history, adding to a long list of environmental and safety violations, according to public records reviewed by The Times.

Most staff at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency tasked with investigating workplace safety, is not working because of the ongoing federal shutdown. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Mitigation Board, which determines root causes from dangerous chemical releases, is also furloughed and could lose its funding because of proposed budget cuts by the Trump administration.

“The Trump administration has defunded the Chemical Safety board, and the federal government is shut down right now,” said Joe Lyou, a resident of nearby Hawthorne and president of the Coalition for Clean Air, a statewide nonprofit. “So there is a very good possibility we are never going to know what really caused this, because the experts in figuring this stuff out are no longer there to do that.”

Without clear answers, labor unions are fearful that a similar disaster could endanger thousands of workers at California’s 15 refineries, which are mostly clustered in Southern California and the Bay Area.

“Companies are making billions in profits and still are making it nearly impossible to make sure we’re safe from terrible disasters,” said Joe Uehlein, board president of the Labor Network for Sustainability. “In California, we’ve seen horrific injuries to workers and tens of thousands of residents have had to seek medical attention in refinery accidents. This time, we got lucky.”

The Chemical Safety Board has identified causes of scores of refinery incidents over its history, including the 2015 explosion at the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance that injured at least two workers.

In that incident, the board’s investigation found multiple safety failures, including a severely eroded safety valve that allowed flammable gases to dangerously seep into unwanted areas. The board also discovered that a large piece of debris almost struck a tank of hydrofluoric acid, which could have resulted in a deadly release of the highly toxic chemical, leading to pressure to cease using the chemical.

But, for the Chevron refinery explosion, there is no guarantee such an investigation will take place. The Trump administration proposed eliminating the budget for the Chemical Safety Board this fiscal year, starting Oct. 1, sunsetting the 27-year-old federal agency. Environmental advocates say that is a mistake.

“They’re undermining our ability to prevent these accidents by taking away the accountability mechanisms in the federal government,” said Lyou. “That’s a huge concern. It’s not politics. Democrats and Republicans live around the Chevron refinery, and they both want to make sure that the refinery is operating safely.”

In the absence of federal regulators, the South Coast Air Quality Management District is investigating potential violations of air quality rules and permit conditions. The refinery will also be required to submit a report analyzing potential causes and equipment breakdowns within 30 days.

So far, the air district has said the fire originated in the refinery’s ISOMAX hydocracking unit, which uses hydrogen to refine oil into jet fuel and diesel. The refinery’s air monitors detected a spike in airborne chemicals after the fire broke out, but air district officials say conditions returned to normal levels after a few hours.

Environmental advocates say the extent of the fallout may not be known until there is a larger examination of air quality monitors.

“I was very surprised that the air district reported they weren’t seeing terribly high levels of pollution,” said Julia May, senior scientist for California-based nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment. “Sometimes in a big refinery fire like this, it goes straight up. But then the smoke comes down in other areas. And that’s a lot of pollution that’s going someplace.”

The Chevron facility had been cited numerous times for environmental and safety violations, according to local and federal records.

The South Coast Air Quality Management District has issued 13 notices of violations over the last 12 months, and 46 in the last five years. Most recently, on Sept. 22, the air district cited the facility for a large chemical leak and failing to keep its equipment in proper working condition.

In August, Chevron representatives had also asked the air district for leniency in assessing compliance with air quality rules while it was working to remove unwanted buildup inside its furnace tubes — conditions that they said risked equipment overheating and potentially failing.

OSHA records show the agency conducted at least 15 inspections at the Chevron refinery in El Segundo over the last decade, identifying 17 violations.

In September 2023, OSHA issued citations related to heat illness prevention requirements, ladderway guardrails and a failure to conduct a thorough hazard analysis — an internal assessment intended to control fires, explosions and chemical releases.

In October 2022, after conducting a planned inspection of the Chevron refinery, OSHA records show the agency identified a “serious” violation of an agency standard requiring employers to “develop, implement and maintain safe work practices to prevent or control hazards,” such as leaks, spills, releases and discharges; and control over entry into hazardous work areas.

During the government shutdown, it’s unclear if OSHA’s pared-down staff will be investigating Thursday’s refinery fire. An OSHA media office phone number went straight to a recorded message stating that the line is not being monitored and “due to a loss of funding, certain government activities have been suspended and I’m unable to respond to your message at this time.”

For some environmentalists, the Chevron refinery fire has underscored why it’s necessary to transition away from fossil fuels altogether.

“They [the refineries] have great workers and great fire departments to respond, but this is an inherently dangerous operation that handles hundreds of thousands of barrels per day of flammable explosive materials under high temperature and high pressure,” said May, the senior scientist for Communities for a Better Environment.

“When something goes wrong, you can have a runaway fire. They did a great job at getting it under control. But do we really want antiquated dirty energy in our communities?”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/577dcda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5272x2768+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F46%2F01%2Ff7e28ed14433b1d3a9392ee4ca8b%2F1524698-me-chevron-refinery-fire-drone-ajs-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 17:59:19.637489

The Importance of Renewable Energy in Addressing Climate Change

Renewable energy is at the forefront of the global fight against climate change.

The impact of renewable energy innovation extends far beyond environmental benefits; it has profound implications for local communities and economies as well. Access to clean energy can significantly improve quality of life by providing reliable electricity for homes, schools, and businesses. In rural areas where traditional energy sources may be scarce or unreliable, renewable energy solutions can empower communities by enabling access to modern amenities such as lighting, refrigeration, and communication technologies.

Economically, renewable energy projects can create jobs across various sectors—from manufacturing solar panels to installing wind turbines. These jobs often provide stable employment opportunities in regions that may have limited economic prospects. Furthermore, by reducing energy costs through local production of renewable resources, communities can redirect funds towards education, healthcare, and other essential services, fostering overall development.

Challenges and Opportunities in Implementing Renewable Energy Projects

While the potential benefits of renewable energy projects are substantial, challenges remain in their implementation. One significant hurdle is securing adequate funding to cover initial capital costs. Many renewable technologies require substantial upfront investment before they can generate returns.

This financial barrier can deter potential investors or limit the scope of projects. However, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation. For instance, innovative financing models such as pay-as-you-go solar systems have emerged as effective solutions for low-income households in developing countries.

By allowing users to pay for solar power incrementally rather than upfront, these models make clean energy more accessible while ensuring a steady revenue stream for providers. Additionally, fostering public-private partnerships can leverage resources from both sectors to overcome financial constraints and drive project success.

Collaboration and Partnerships in Renewable Energy Innovation

Collaboration is a cornerstone of successful renewable energy initiatives. By forming partnerships with local governments, businesses, NGOs, and community organizations, project developers can enhance their impact and sustainability. Collaborative efforts often lead to shared resources, knowledge exchange, and increased community buy-in—essential elements for the long-term success of any renewable energy project.

For example, the partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and local governments in various countries has led to successful implementation of solar microgrid projects that empower rural communities. These collaborations not only provide technical expertise but also ensure that projects align with local needs and priorities. By fostering a sense of ownership among community members through participatory approaches, these partnerships enhance the likelihood of project sustainability.

The Role of Technology and Research in Advancing Renewable Energy Solutions

Technological advancements play a pivotal role in driving innovation within the renewable energy sector. Research institutions and universities are at the forefront of developing new technologies that improve efficiency and reduce costs associated with renewable energy production.

Craig Segall is a former deputy executive officer and assistant chief counsel of the California Air Resources Board.","California’s air is under attack — by the very companies that promised to clean it up.

In 2023, truck manufacturers struck a deal with the California Air Resources Board to drastically reduce emissions and invest in electric trucks. This summer, however, several of the companies — Daimler Truck, Volvo Group, Paccar and Traton — backed out of the partnership and sued California, with support from the Trump administration. Now fossil-fuel-aligned corporations are leveraging political connections to weaken oversight, erode environmental protections and entrench their dominance.

This is no longer just about truck emissions. It’s about who gets to write the rules that govern our economy and who gets to decide how polluted our state will be. It’s about defending democracy from corporate overreach.

Likely seeing an opportunity to profit from diesel under new federal leadership, the major truck manufacturers doing business in California are injecting instability into the very market they once sought to stabilize. This is political opportunism, plain and simple.

The 2023 deal, known as the Clean Truck Partnership, was rooted in trust and a shared interest in predictable, stable rules during the transition away from fossil fuels. It wasn’t a regulation or a law; it was a collaboration — an experiment in handshake agreements that now looks like a cautionary tale for regulators and communities everywhere: Corporations can walk away from deals like this the moment political winds shift or the quarterly earnings dip.

The manufacturers’ gratuitous lawsuit comes alongside a proposed rollback of the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas standards and a surprise Federal Trade Commission move to condemn the partnership. The commission issued a statement closing an investigation it never publicly announced, after the companies sent letters playing victim. Is it any surprise that Trump’s federal lawyers jumped in days later to sue California along with the truck makers?

The consequences of breaking the agreement are real and devastating. Diesel freight pollution has long hit hardest in low-income neighborhoods and communities of color near ports, warehouses and freight corridors, causing higher rates of asthma, heart disease and cancer. Rolling back the Clean Truck Partnership means more diesel trucks on California roads, more hospital visits and more lives cut short. It’s an assault on environmental justice that tells Californians their health is expendable.

And everyone pays. Delaying clean truck adoption locks fleets into high and volatile diesel prices and undermines U.S. competitiveness. The manufacturers themselves are maintaining that crisis by discouraging the shift to electric trucks: California has documented a $94,000 markup on some electric trucks in the U.S. compared with Europe.

When a handful of corporations can derail public policy this way, states must push back. California tried a compromise; now it must defend its right to set stronger standards, invest in clean infrastructure and refuse to subsidize companies that break their commitments.

California’s leadership on clean transportation has helped it become the world’s fourth-largest economy. Its authority to set its own standards has driven innovation, created jobs and put more zero-emission vehicles on the road than in any other state. The public wants clean air and modern infrastructure. The choice is clear: double down on clean truck commitments or cede leadership to China and watch our industries and economy fall behind.

A predictable market is essential for corporate investment in the energy transition. California brokered this partnership to give manufacturers the certainty they said they needed and say they still need. Now some of those same manufacturers are adding uncertainty by trying to revert to older standards and delay the transition. But it must come, and the sooner the better — for manufacturers, Californians and the nation.

There’s still time to do the right thing. The truck makers who broke their word can still step up to electrify trucks. And the manufacturers who have not joined the lawsuit against California — Cummins, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — should publicly reaffirm the goals of the Clean Truck Partnership, follow through on their commitments and reap the rewards. If these companies choose to stand with California now, they won’t just be honoring a promise; they’ll be helping build an economy that creates good jobs, drives innovation and secures a competitive future for American freight.

She’s concerned about how the rise of data centers will impact the coal industry and prolong its existence.","Although Ashley Williams is disappointed to see a federal agency endorse the nation’s coal industry, she isn’t surprised.

“It’s just environmentally and economically reckless to resuscitate a dying industry,” said Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “It’s a disservice to every worker, every coal-impacted resident out there. … (The government) should support coal-impacted communities to be able to transition to the next stage beyond fossil fuels.”

The U.S. Department of Energy, in a Monday news release, announced that it’s investing $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” coal plants nationwide.

Indiana environmental activists worry about what this means for the future of renewable energy statewide, especially with the rise of data centers.

The DOE’s funding is in accordance with two executive orders from President Donald Trump, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electrical Grid,” according to the news release.

“Beautiful, clean coal will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the (artificial intelligence) race,” Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the news release. “These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption. Coal built the greatest industrial engine the world has ever known, and with President Trump’s leadership, it will help do so again.”

Through funding, the DOE will allocate $350 million for coal recommissioning and retrofit; $175 million for rural capacity and energy affordability projects; $50 million for the development and implementation of advanced wastewater management systems; $25 million for engineering and implementation of dual firing retrofits; and $25 million for the development and testing of natural gas cofiring systems, according to the department’s website.

In April, the DOE announced it would “unleash American coal production,” including assessing accessibility of federal lands to “expedite coal leasing and lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands.”

Williams called the actions by the agency a “ridiculous and insulting use of taxpayer dollars.”

“I think this is really a despicable distraction,” she added. “It’s using this dying industry to prop up big tech and the proliferation of hyperscale data centers across Indiana, especially in this region.”

In September, the Michigan City Common Council passed four resolutions related to a potential data center in the area, which Williams and various other Michigan City residents were opposed to. The council heard more than one hour of public comment before voting on the data center resolutions.

Resolutions included granting tax abatements; designating the area as an economic revitalization area; and approving a taxpayer agreement for “Project Maize,” also known as a data center at 402 Royal Road.

Hobart residents also opposed a data center in the city, according to Post-Tribune archives, which was proposed to be built on a 168-acre parcel on 61st Avenue, about half a mile from the roadway’s intersection with Colorado Street. City officials have voted for that project to move forward.

“Big tech is just competing with each other to be able to win this race,” Williams said. “That’s what this is about. It’s not about bringing us into the next era and doing this for the American public. It has nothing to do with us and everything to do with greed.”

Senior Campaign Organizer Megan Anderson also isn’t surprised by the DOE’s coal industry funding announcement on Monday. She’s concerned about how the rise of data centers will impact the coal industry and prolong its existence.

“This is very dangerous,” Anderson said. “If you’re concerned about climate change, we have to phase out the use of coal, and now we’re seeing this massive uptick in gas use. We’re seeing coal plants being left online to serve data centers.”

Anderson is also worried about how Hoosiers’ health will be impacted by these actions, especially with air pollution from coal plants.

According to the American Lung Association’s April “State of the Air” report, Lake County has received failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only passed in annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

“It’s not just higher bills or public health damage — it’s part of a series of actions,” Anderson said. “It’s not entirely unexpected, but nonetheless, it’s going to be bad for Americans.”

With data centers, Anderson and Citizens Action Coalition Program Director Ben Inskeep are worried about how Hoosiers’ energy bills might be affected.

According to a Citizens Action Coalition report, electricity bills have increased more than $28 per month statewide, or 17.5%. NIPCSO residential customers were hit hardest, according to the July 23 report, with about $50 per month, or 26.7%, increase in one year.

The organization created an accountability campaign called “Stop Mike’s Hikes,” which has several asks for Gov. Mike Braun, including to fight for realistic and transparent energy planning; keep bills in check; embrace wind and solar power; and make large energy consumers like data centers pay their fair share, according to Post-Tribune archives.

Inskeep worries that utility bills will continue to rise throughout the Midwest to keep coal plants open.

“My concern is that some utility executives, in an attempt to gain favor with the Trump administration, might pursue something that’s uneconomic for the ratepayers to simply get political benefits from it,” Inskeep said.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association — which NIPCSO is a member of — previously told the Post-Tribune that the state’s energy future “cannot be reduced to a debate of ‘this resource versus that one.’”

“The reality is our state needs a balanced mix of resources to ensure energy is reliable, affordable, and available when and where it’s needed,” McGrath previously said in a statement. “While wind and solar play an important role, they cannot meet Indiana’s energy needs on their own. Natural gas, coal, nuclear, and other dispatchable resources remain critical to keeping the lights on, supporting job growth, and maintaining our state’s economic competitiveness.”

Inskeep said the use of coal is expensive, dirty and unreliable as other energy alternatives are available. He also believes that utility companies should focus on energy sources that will be efficient after the Trump administration leaves office.

Energy-efficient resources that would benefit from more investment include wind and solar power, Inskeep added.

“(Utility companies) need to think about protecting their customers over the coming decades,” Inskeep said. “An investment to reopen a coal plant, in terms of it being a good deal for customers in the long term, that just seems very unlikely, given today’s economy.”

The legislative text says that any appeal or motion filed more than two years ago needs to be scheduled for hearing by December 2026. The hearing has to take place by December 2027.

The law will ensure that certain violent offenders are denied cashless bail, and will limit judges' authority over pretrial release while requiring more defendants to undergo mental health evaluations. In case a defen­dant charged with a vio­lent offense was invol­un­tar­i­ly com­mit­ted with­in the past three years, the evaluations could become manda­to­ry.

Brown, a schizophrenic homeless man with a prison record, was let go free on cashless bail. Brown, who has now been charged with first-degree murder, was arrested several times in the past since 2011 for felony larceny, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and communicating threats. He served five years in prison for the robbery with a deadly weapon charge.

More about the new law

According to the Death Penalty Information Center, “HB 307 impos­es stricter pre­tri­al release con­di­tions, requires invol­un­tary men­tal health eval­u­a­tions for defen­dants under cer­tain cir­cum­stances, short­ens the time­line for cap­i­tal case appeals, and pro­vides an alter­na­tive to the cur­rent method of exe­cu­tion — lethal injec­tion. North Carolina last car­ried out an exe­cu­tion in 2006. Legislators say the leg­is­la­tion is a response to the death of Iryna Zarutska, who was killed on Charlotte, North Carolina’s pub­lic tran­sit sys­tem in August 2025.”

Changes to North Carolina’s death penal­ty sys­tem are among the most important provisions of the bill. The Death Penalty Information Center says, “The leg­is­la­tion estab­lish­es strict time­lines for pend­ing appeals and motions in cap­i­tal cas­es, requir­ing any fil­ing more than 24 months old to be sched­uled for a hear­ing by December 2026, and no lat­er than December 2027. This expe­dit­ed time­line would require North Carolina courts to hear and decide near­ly all of the state’s more than 120 death row cas­es in the next two years, a feat that risks wrong­ful exe­cu­tions in a state where 12 peo­ple have been exon­er­at­ed from death row since 1972. In direct response to Ms. Zarutska’s death, HB 307 adds a new aggra­vat­ing fac­tor that allows pros­e­cu­tors to seek the death penal­ty when a cap­i­tal felony is com­mit­ted against some­one on public transportation.”

The legislation even changed the state’s avail­able meth­ods of exe­cu­tion. The Death Penalty Information Center that says HB 307 “includes lan­guage that removes the pro­hi­bi­tion against elec­tro­cu­tion and lethal gas, while retain­ing lethal injec­tion as the pri­ma­ry method of exe­cu­tion.”

The website adds, “If lethal injec­tion is deemed uncon­sti­tu­tion­al, the new bill adds pro­vi­sions that allow the use of any exe­cu­tion method approved by anoth­er state, so long as the U.S. Supreme Court has not declared the method to be uncon­sti­tu­tion­al. The U.S. Supreme Court has nev­er found a method of exe­cu­tion to be unconstitutional.”",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/05/1600x900/logo/Commuter-Stabbing-Charlotte-Vigil-0_1759647255275_1759647273153.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 19:00:10.720012

If that's the case, but you still want to experience at-home solar energy, leasing solar panels could be the solution.","If you're on the fence about getting solar panels, an expert has sage advice: Get up and act now.

During an interview with Fox 32's Good Day Chicago, Windfree Solar CEO Eric Heineman encouraged homeowners to act quickly on getting solar panels to take advantage of a 30% federal tax credit that expires at the end of 2025.

""If you pay taxes, if you make money legally, you can get tax credits when you buy solar,"" Heineman said.

Solar panels allow homeowners to reduce their reliance on dirty, polluting energy sources while taking advantage of clean energy that can also bring monthly electricity bills way down.

And thanks to rebates and tax credits, the upfront cost may be lower than you'd expect. That's especially true when using EnergySage's free tools, which allow homeowners to compare quotes from several installation companies to find the right deal.

Heineman also pointed out that the U.S. Treasury has changed its rules surrounding the solar tax credit. Previously, panels had to be fully installed by Dec. 31 to qualify for the credit. Now, Heineman said, homeowners need to have a signed contract and to have paid at least 5% of the total cost to qualify.

Along with the federal credit, many states offer rebates and credits that will extend into next year and beyond.

Illinois, for example, offers tax credits that, when added to federal credits, can result in up to 70% in total savings. To see what's available for your home, EnergySage offers a free mapping tool that shows incentives and the average installation cost by state.

""When you compound it all, it's like a three- to five-year payback,"" Heineman told Good Day Chicago. ""Without the tax credits, it can be a six- to eight-year payback.""

In total, EnergySage estimates the average homeowner can save up to $10,000 on solar installations. Of course, even with credits and rebates, the upfront cost may be prohibitive for some.

If that's the case, but you still want to experience at-home solar energy, leasing solar panels could be the solution. Palmetto's LightReach program allows homeowners to do just that, providing leasing options that require little to no money down.

And getting solar panels can be just the start of your eco-friendly home upgrades. Pairing those panels with electric appliances, like an energy-efficient heat pump, not only further reduces your carbon footprint, but it also drives your utility costs down even more. Mitsubishi can help you find not only the right heat pump for your home, but also the right installer for your budget.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/solar-tax-creditimage-reckZx15h5V3uTyGb.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 01:59:11.293180

A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","BLASDELL, N.Y., Oct. 5, 2025 (AP) – More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet “delusional” green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That’s enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

“This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way “to protect us until we know more,” said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

“They’re banking on nothing happening, but I don’t think you can place it where they’re proposing and assume nothing’s going to happen,” Sokolowski said. “It’s just too risky if it does.”

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system “poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will “strengthen and modernize our grid.”

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.

This family-friendly forest preserve is free to the public and welcomes the community with its organic beauty.

Dutro-Ernst serves to inform and encourage everyone in the community to explore the local nature. This forest preserve contains several features that cater to the public. Located right at the preserve’s entrance is a nature play area stacked with logs and rocks for children to play on. In addition to this, signs are located all throughout the trail to teach kids about the land and the species that reside around the area. These are meant to promote environmental literacy in the youth of Muncie.

Beyond serving the children in Muncie, Dutro-Ernst has become a beacon of communion for community members. If you travel down the gravel path, you will pass by a stick village built and maintained by community members themselves. Red-tail Land Conservancy Outreach Coordinator Kendalynn Ross recognized the importance of establishing a relationship with the environment.

“I think it’s really important that the community knows that people are allowed in nature,” Ross asserted. She continues, saying, ""I feel like having urban nature areas, like Dutro, allows the community to see that there are ways that you can get involved.

The community plays a big role in keeping the conservation of Dutro-Ernst alive. The public has access to unique opportunities such as helping in efforts to reseed the prairie, or weeding out invasive species on the preserve’s grounds.

Ross encouraged Muncie residents to connect to the wildlife.

“I always say just reach out. Going on our website, looking at social media, and signing up for those events, that’s all great ways to help us see that the community still cares, but also for us to know what the community is looking for and what role they want to play in this,” said Ross.

India is among the worst polluters in the world, and the country’s cities are regularly blanketed in a cloud of smog, which has an inevitable effect on the health of its citizens. The Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) announced recently that it has added 4.8 GW of new solar cell capacity to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-II.

The Indian government is working hard to promote the solar power sector with its list of approved manufacturers

The Indian government established the list in 2021, and the solar sector has seen massive benefits thanks to the pioneering approach to the sector being led by the ALMM list for modules. The government-led list of solar manufacturers, primarily Indian-based, allows for the companies’ modules to be used in government-supported projects, of which there are many.

Over the past four years, the 21 registered module manufacturers in the ALMM have increased to 100, operating 123 separate manufacturing plants across the vast Indian country.

The previously approved solar cell capacity comes from a wide range of companies that include:

PV manufacturers Adani

Emmvee

Premier Energies

Mundra Solar

ReNew

Jupiter International

First Solar

Industry stakeholders have welcomed the addition of the new solar cell manufacturers to the ALMM list

For a country as industrious as India, more effort is needed to develop the country’s solar cell manufacturing sector. Solar power could play a vital role in India’s decarbonization ambitions.

The first update to the list comes from two main manufacturers, although they both fall under the utility Tata Power. The majority of the capacity added to the list is for Mono passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) cells. Of that, TP Solar is enlisting nearly 4.5GW of annual capacity and Tata Power Renewable Energy 280MW.

TP Solar’s facility is located in the state of Tamil Nadu, while the Tata Power Renewable Energy cell processing plant is located in the nearby state of Karnataka. The ALMM List-II comprises more than half of the operational capacity for solar cells in India. Data from industry observers has shown how the annual nameplate capacity for solar cells tripled from 9GW to 25GW between March 2024 and March 2025.

The update to the list comes just days after the Indian government announced that it plans to add wafers to the ALMM starting from June 2028. The announcement has been welcomed by India’s vast number of solar cell manufacturers, including Premium Energies’ chief business officer, Vinay Rustagi, who stated that the move was a logical next step for the country to be self-reliant in solar manufacturing.

“We believe that the policy is very well thought out and is aligned with the government’s intent,” – Premium Energies’ chief business officer, Vinay Rustagi

Adding to the reputation of solar power globally, the Energy Information Agency has noted that solar power will continue to play a vital role in the future in the United States.

Peabody Energy Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Peabody Energy shareholder, you need to believe that recent U.S. policy support, including expanded federal land access, regulatory rollbacks, and new coal funding, can power a sustained “coal comeback” despite ongoing global trends toward renewables. These tailwinds have been the most important short-term catalyst, reflected in Peabody's sharp share price surge, while the biggest risk remains the enduring threat of long-term coal demand decline and policy shifts if political priorities change. The latest news materially strengthens the short-term narrative but long-term risks tied to decarbonization persist. The company's completed buyback, retiring over 17% of its outstanding shares, stands out against this backdrop. Increased federal support may boost near-term cash flow, supporting capital returns like buybacks and dividends, but long-term revenue visibility still hinges on domestic coal demand and regulatory certainty. However, investors should also consider the potential for abrupt changes in political support for coal...

Peabody Energy's narrative projects $4.9 billion revenue and $468.2 million earnings by 2028. This requires 6.4% yearly revenue growth and a $327.3 million earnings increase from $140.9 million today.

Most Popular Narrative: 56.7% Overvalued

Despite analyst consensus raising Bloom Energy’s fair value to $57.63, the last close at $90.29 indicates a substantial premium being priced in by the market. The narrative builds its outlook on sector tailwinds and anticipated future profitability, which together support a bold growth story for the years ahead.

Ongoing product cost reductions and digital-twin-enabled operational improvements, fueled by AI-driven analytics from a large installed base, are lowering cost per watt and raising manufacturing efficiency. These trends are poised to drive continued operating margin and net margin expansion.

Interesting Engineering reported that the DOE will conditionally provide high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU, to three U.S. companies. HALEU is necessary to develop and run advanced nuclear reactors.

""The HALEU allocation program is a win for the economy, energy security, and the American people,"" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in a statement.

The DOE defines nuclear fission as the process of splitting the nucleus of an atom into two or more smaller particles. Nuclear power plants use the heat generated by this process to create electricity.

Nuclear fission doesn't pollute as much as coal does. It's cleaner in that it doesn't release polluting gases into the air. But it still creates radioactive waste that must be stored properly.

Indigenous peoples living in the U.S. are also speaking out about how nuclear energy has disproportionately affected them. According to Prism, Indigenous communities in the Southwest have been contaminated by uranium mining since the 1940s.

The White Mesa Mill in Utah was built on an ancestral site of the Ute Mountain Ute tribe in 1979. After uranium prices dropped, the mill started processing imported radioactive waste, which it stored on the land.

In addition to the cultural impact of this extraction, Indigenous communities are concerned about their drinking water. If radioactive waste gets into the local aquifer, residents won't have clean drinking water. They'll also be at higher risk for a whole host of health issues.

Finding better ways to store radioactive waste away from native lands will keep communities safer. One solution scientists are working on is using gamma rays to turn waste itself into energy. It could even be used to create rechargeable batteries.

For now, the DOE may distribute the HALEU it has conditionally committed to giving as early as the end of the year. It plans to allocate more HALEU to more companies in the future.

Shares of Centrus Energy (NYSEMKT: LEU) increased 53.7% in September, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Centrus Energy, a leading U.S. supplier of nuclear fuel and enrichment services, benefited from news that the U.S. government is supporting policies aimed at boosting domestic production of nuclear materials. The company also announced it would expand its U.S.-based enrichment plant to support U.S. production and reduce reliance on foreign entities. Here's what investors need to know.

Centrus Energy's leap comes amid growing support for U.S. nuclear production

On Sept. 15, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration announced that it would take steps to support domestic nuclear materials production and enrichment.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright recommended that the U.S. increase its strategic uranium reserve to help buffer against Russian supplies. Russian supplies were banned in August 2024. This ban won't be fully phased in until 2028, when waivers allowing limited Russian deliveries expire. This creates a significant need to replace approximately 25% of enriched uranium currently imported from Russia.

The recommendation to boost the uranium reserve boosted confidence across the industry, driving several uranium and nuclear stocks higher during the month.

Increased support from the federal government is a positive development for Centrus, which plans a major expansion to boost production of Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU). Centrus currently has two commercial agreements to sell LEU, one of which is with TEXEX, a Russian entity.

In the long term, Centrus aims to produce LEU and HALEU at its Piketon, Ohio plant, utilizing its advanced centrifuge technology. It is the only Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed producer of HALEU currently operating at scale for both commercial and national security applications.

The expansion of its Ohio plant hinges on Department of Energy funding, private investment, and long-term customer commitments. Centrus has raised over $1.2 billion and secured contingent purchase commitments of $2 billion from utilities. However, the full scale and timing of the expansion remain contingent on federal funding decisions from the Department of Energy.

With the U.S. signaling a willingness to support domestic production of key mineral resources, this is a good sign that Centrus could secure the necessary funding to expand its operations and become a top domestic supplier of LEU and HALEU uranium. While HALEU is not currently used in commercial reactors, it is essential for advanced reactor designs under development, making it critical for next-generation nuclear technology.

Centrus is well-positioned for a nuclear revival

Centrus Energy is riding the wave higher as uranium and nuclear power-related stocks surge. This demand is likely to persist, too, given the massive amount of energy required to power the data centers behind artificial intelligence (AI).

The company's Piketon facility has the potential to be crucial to domestic fuel production. However, scaling it will require time and capital and hinges on securing funding. The stock trades at a premium today, but for investors who believe in the long-term nuclear revival, Centrus is one way to gain exposure to it.

The DTI said its premier investment promotion agency, Board of Investments (BoI), endorsed 65 strategic projects worth P1.78 trillion for Green Lane Certification, expected to generate 157,330 jobs, spanning the renewable energy, infrastructure, manufacturing and agri-food sectors.

Renewable energy remains the backbone of investments granted green lane privileges, with 50 projects accounting for nearly three-quarters of the total project costs, equivalent to P1.33 trillion.

In comparison, infrastructure and PPP initiatives contribute significantly, totaling P415.87 billion across four projects. Smaller but strategic bets include food security, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing, each signaling the government’s intent to catalyze value chains beyond commodity sectors.

Since the Green Lane’s launch in 2023, its cumulative footprint is even more striking: 216 projects valued at P5.9 trillion, poised to generate 392,827 jobs.

This institutional mechanism has become central to channeling investments into the country’s highest-potential, future-ready sectors.

“Through the Green Lane mechanism, we are accelerating high-impact investments that create jobs, enable technology transfer, and advance our transition to a sustainable, innovation-led economy,” Trade Secretary and BoI Chairman Cristina Roque said.

The impact of these Green Lane projects is felt nationwide. In Compostela, Cebu, SteelAsia’s Compostela Works, inaugurated by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr., now stands as the largest and most modern steel mill in the country, producing one million tons of rebar annually.

The facility reduces import dependence and strengthens domestic manufacturing capabilities, embodying industrial self-reliance.

In Pampanga, the President also led the inauguration of Farm Fresh Milk, a Malaysian-Philippine joint venture dairy processing plant that underscores the administration’s drive for agricultural resilience and dairy self-sufficiency.

Clean energy milestones continue to rise as well: The Terra Solar Project, one of the country’s largest renewable energy undertakings, is poised to power millions of homes with clean, reliable electricity. Meanwhile, the SMN Poultry facility in Davao del Sur, as well as global firms like Unilever and Procter & Gamble, through its new Lighthouse Factory, demonstrate how both local and multinational investors are scaling up their Philippine operations with modern, digital, and sustainable facilities.

Parallel to this, the BoI’s regular investment approvals for January to September 2025 reached P653.5 billion across 206 projects, with nearly 26,000 jobs expected.

“These investment figures demonstrate the sustained trust of both local and foreign investors in the Philippines’ capability to provide a stable and enabling business environment,” Ma. Corazon H. Halili-Dichosa, BoI executive director for Industry Development Services, said.

“They also affirm that our policies to strengthen key industries, particularly energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure, are creating real value for the economy and for Filipino workers.”

Hub for sustainable businesses

“At the same time, these projects reflect the success of our ongoing efforts to promote the Philippines as a hub for smart, sustainable, and future-ready investments,” Evariste M. Cagatan, BoI executive director for Investments Promotion Services, added.

“By channeling strategic capital into high-growth sectors such as renewable energy, logistics, and ICT, we are ensuring that investor confidence translates into inclusive growth and stronger regional competitiveness.”

During this period, approved investments were heavily concentrated in the Energy and Efficiency sector, totaling P423.52 billion, garnering the largest share of the total approved funds among the industries.

Other leading sectors in 2025 included Airports and Seaports at P144.95 billion, Manufacturing at P29.35 billion, Mass Housing at P25.56 billion, and Information and Communication at P9.34 billion, which notably has the biggest surge among the industries, soaring by 6,293 percent compared to last year’s P146.15 million.

Local investments accounted for the majority of the total approved amount, with P569.30 billion worth of assets.

On the other hand, foreign investments also constituted a substantial portion of the approved projects, amounting to P84.2 billion.

“The DTI and the BoI remain dedicated to attracting more investments through a whole-of-government approach to position the Philippines as a prime investment destination. These figures highlight the significant opportunities offered by the Philippines’ strong and rapidly expanding economy, especially in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, smart manufacturing, semiconductors, renewable energy, high-tech agriculture, and data center infrastructure,” according to Roque.",https://media.assettype.com/tribune%2F2025-10-05%2F43fdgd9r%2F06leadfoto.png?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-10-05 14:00:18.173124

Unlike stripped-down EV models in the same price bracket, Ford’s midsize electric truck is being developed with comfort and utility in mind.","The vehicle, set to launch in 2027, will be produced on a completely reengineered assembly system and platform, designed to significantly lower production costs.

This initiative marks a major shift in how the Detroit-based automaker approaches vehicle design and manufacturing. With a total investment of $5 billion—$2 billion into the Louisville Assembly Plant and $3 billion for battery production in Michigan—Ford is betting on radical transformation to stay competitive in the evolving EV market.

CEO Jim Farley described the move as “the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,” during an event announcing the new platform. The company is introducing both a new product and a new industrial method, reflecting a broader effort to align legacy manufacturing with the demands of electric mobility.

A Redesigned Production Model to Cut Complexity

At the core of this shift is the creation of the Ford Universal EV Platform and an all-new manufacturing approach dubbed the Universal EV Production System. Rather than following a traditional single-line assembly belt, Ford’s new “assembly tree” breaks down the production process into three sub-lines that converge into one.

Doug Field, Ford’s EV chief of digital and design, called it “the first time anyone’s done this anywhere in the world,” as reported by CBS News. The approach is expected to streamline the workflow, improve ergonomics, and increase production speed. The truck will reportedly be built 40% faster than current models produced at the Louisville plant, which is being modernized specifically for this purpose.

According to InsideEVs, the system will use 20% fewer parts, 25% fewer fasteners, and 40% fewer factory workstations. This reduction in complexity is a key component of Ford’s plan to bring the price of its electric truck down to $30,000 without sacrificing size or performance.

Toyota Boosts Range of Its First Electric SUV And Drops Prices

A Platform to Support a Family of Next-Gen EVs

The electric pickup is just the starting point. The new Universal EV Platform is designed to be modular and flexible, capable of supporting multiple vehicle types. A graphic presented by Ford includes outlines for a pickup truck, a three-row SUV, a small crossover, and a cargo van, though not all variants have been confirmed.

Ford aims to address one of the most persistent challenges for legacy automakers: electrical architecture. The company is adopting a zonal approach, significantly reducing wiring—by more than 4,000 feet compared to the Mustang Mach-E—and enabling a simpler yet more powerful setup using fewer electronic control units.

Kevin Young, Ford’s head of advanced manufacturing programs, emphasized the importance of this change: “Wiring is the nemesis. If you don’t change that input, then nothing else is ever going to change.” This strategy mirrors efforts by Tesla and Rivian, both of which have made similar changes to wiring harnesses in order to boost efficiency.

U.S.-Made Batteries and Focus on Affordability

Ford’s decision to localize battery production is central to its effort to control costs. The upcoming pickup will use lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in a prismatic cell format—built at the BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan. The battery tech will be licensed from CATL, but production will take place domestically.

This will make Ford the first American automaker to use U.S.-made LFP batteries. These cobalt- and nickel-free batteries are cheaper and more stable than traditional lithium-ion alternatives, allowing Ford to reduce dependency on expensive imported materials.

Unlike stripped-down EV models in the same price bracket, Ford’s midsize electric truck is being developed with comfort and utility in mind. It will feature a frunk, more interior space than a Toyota RAV4, and faster acceleration than the Mustang EcoBoost, which reaches 60 mph in about five seconds.

Jim Farley addressed the industry’s track record of failed affordable car projects in Detroit, stating: “Nobody wants to see another good college try by a Detroit automaker to make an affordable vehicle that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty.” He noted that Ford’s new approach involved a small, dedicated team that reimagined the moving assembly line from scratch.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Close-up-of-the-front-of-a-FORD-SUV.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 15:01:08.771269

But Louisiana’s own $1 million bycatch study tells a different story - one that underscores how sustainable and responsible the menhaden fishery is.
The adoption of new hose-end cage technology industry-wide , for example, has reduced the menhaden industry’s red drum mortality by 24% in 2025.
The buffer zone expansions, therefore, do little to protect prized game fish but impose enormous costs on the menhaden industry and the communities it supports.
The recent half-mile buffer zone extension has introduced quantifiable challenges for the menhaden fishery, limiting areas where vessels can operate and reducing access to historically productive waters.","Louisiana’s working coast has long depended on the Gulf menhaden fishery - a sustainable industry that supports more than 2,000 jobs, contributes $419 million annually, generates $25 million in state and local tax revenue, and purchases $62 million in goods and services from 32 parishes. Yet, despite this enormous positive impact, recent regulatory changes threaten to undermine this lifeline industry and the communities that depend on it.

At issue is the decision to extend the state’s menhaden buffer zone in recent years. Historically, the fishery operated along the Inside/Outside Line and Double Rig Line - longstanding boundaries for commercial fishing that had already limited where menhaden vessels could operate. In 2021, the buffer zone was extended by one-quarter mile, and again in 2024 to a half-mile from the original line.

While these changes may sound incremental, the impact has been anything but small. The half-mile restriction has excluded thousands of acres of historically productive fishing grounds. In just 3 years, the industry experienced a 25% reduction in fish caught. For an industry already operating on tight margins, this loss is unsustainable, harming not only the companies that fish for menhaden but also thousands of Louisiana families whose livelihoods depend on this fishery.

An Industry That Fuels Local Economies

Louisiana’s menhaden industry is powered by two companies - Westbank Fishing out of Empire, LA (Plaquemines Parish) and Ocean Harvesters out of Abbeville, LA (Vermilion Parish). Contrary to the misinformation that has been spread, both these companies are U.S.-based, U.S.-owned and are totally controlled by U.S. citizens. Together with the two processing companies (Daybrook Fisheries and Omega Protein), they employ more than 800 people directly on vessels and in processing plants, while another 1,200 jobs ripple across rural communities through suppliers, service companies, and transportation providers. These are stable, year-round jobs that anchor small-town economies in parishes where economic opportunities are limited.

Beyond economics, menhaden plays a critical role in global supply chains. These small, oily fish are processed into fishmeal and fish oil essential for petfood, animal feed, and aquaculture. Without a reliable domestic menhaden supply, the United States would be forced to rely on imports, raising costs for consumers and weakening food security.

Bycatch Numbers Tell The Real Story

Bycatch Numbers Tell the Real Story Too often, buffer zone expansions have been driven by perception rather than science. Proponents cite concerns about bycatch, particularly the unintended capture of red drum. But Louisiana’s own $1 million bycatch study tells a different story - one that underscores how sustainable and responsible the menhaden fishery is.

The study found the menhaden fleet accounts for just 3.4% of red drum caught. In addition, the fishery operated well below the 5% total bycatch set by the State of Louisiana as a maximum bycatch threshold. By contrast, the recreational sector - nearly 407,000 licensed saltwater anglers in 2023- 24 according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries - accounts for 96.6% of all red drum mortalities off Louisiana’s coast. In fact, LDWF data show red drum are experiencing overfishing driven by this recreational pressure.

What’s more, the bycatch study found that 84% of red drum survive after being rolled out of the nets after the completion of menhaden sets. Industry-led innovations are driving this survival rate even higher. The adoption of new hose-end cage technology industry-wide , for example, has reduced the menhaden industry’s red drum mortality by 24% in 2025.

The menhaden fleet has also invested heavily in improving gear to prevent past issues. Since 2023, companies have spent $6.5 million upgrading to Spectra/Plateena nets, which are stronger, more durable, and significantly reduce net tears that once led to unintended spills.

Taken together, the data show a fishery that is meeting bycatch standards, innovating to improve, and ensuring red drum populations are not negatively impacted.

The Myth of Predator Dependence

Another argument often cited against menhaden harvesting is that predator fish like speckled trout and red drum depend almost exclusively on menhaden as food. Yet new research disproves this claim. A University of Southern Mississippi study found Gulf predator species do not exclusively rely on menhaden. Instead, they consume a variety of prey, including shrimp, crabs, and other forage fish.

This evidence underscores that the ecological role of menhaden, while important, is not the sole factor sustaining predator populations. The buffer zone expansions, therefore, do little to protect prized game fish but impose enormous costs on the menhaden industry and the communities it supports.

A Call for Balance

Louisiana has long prided itself on balancing conservation with economic opportunity. The recent half-mile buffer zone extension has introduced quantifiable challenges for the menhaden fishery, limiting areas where vessels can operate and reducing access to historically productive waters.

The industry remains a significant contributor to the state’s economy and operates under state science-based management standards, which are designed to ensure sustainability.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/c1/1c1cd754-55f9-4cbc-8c13-d73874502ddb/68dfd988cee82.image.jpg?crop=1638%2C860%2C0%2C203&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-05 14:01:05.255843

Williams Companies Investment Narrative Recap

To be a shareholder in Williams Companies today, you need to believe in the ongoing strength of natural gas and the crucial role of pipelines and power infrastructure in the digital economy. The recent announcement of a US$3.1 billion investment in power projects targeted at data centers does not materially affect the most important near-term catalyst, accelerating demand from LNG exports and AI-driven data center growth, but does incrementally increase the company's long-term capital commitments, which may bring higher execution and leverage risks.

Of the company's recent developments, the successful commissioning of the Southeast Energy Connector and Texas to Louisiana Energy Pathway stands out. These projects, completed just months before the new data center power initiative, directly addressed system constraints while increasing natural gas delivery capacity, underpinning Williams’ ability to keep pace with rising service demand and reinforcing the company’s reliance on growing infrastructure throughput.

Examples of Successful Clean Energy Initiatives Supported by NGOs and Carbon Credit Funds Numerous successful clean energy initiatives demonstrate the potential of leveraging carbon credit funds effectively.","Carbon credit funds are financial instruments designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by allowing organizations to invest in projects that either prevent emissions or remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Each carbon credit typically represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) that has been avoided or sequestered. These funds are crucial in the global effort to combat climate change, as they provide a mechanism for businesses and governments to offset their emissions while simultaneously funding sustainable development projects.

Clean energy initiatives, on the other hand, focus on generating energy from renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, which are essential for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and minimizing environmental degradation. The intersection of carbon credit funds and clean energy initiatives creates a powerful synergy. By investing in renewable energy projects, organizations can generate carbon credits that can be sold or traded, creating a revenue stream that can be reinvested into further sustainability efforts.

This not only helps to finance clean energy projects but also encourages innovation and the adoption of new technologies. Understanding this relationship is vital for NGOs looking to leverage carbon credit funds to support their clean energy initiatives effectively.

Key Takeaways

Carbon credit funds support clean energy initiatives by providing financial incentives for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

NGOs play a crucial role in promoting clean energy solutions by raising awareness, advocating for policy changes, and implementing projects on the ground.

Identifying opportunities for carbon credit funding involves assessing potential emission reduction activities and understanding the requirements of carbon credit standards.

Developing projects to utilize carbon credit funds requires careful planning, implementation, and monitoring to ensure the success of clean energy initiatives.

Building partnerships with private and public sectors is essential for accessing funding, expertise, and resources to support clean energy projects.

The Role of NGOs in Promoting Clean Energy Solutions

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) play a pivotal role in promoting clean energy solutions, particularly in underserved communities where access to reliable energy sources is limited. NGOs often act as intermediaries between local populations and funding sources, helping to identify needs and mobilize resources for clean energy projects. Their grassroots connections enable them to understand the unique challenges faced by communities, allowing them to tailor solutions that are culturally appropriate and sustainable.

Moreover, NGOs are instrumental in raising awareness about the importance of clean energy and its benefits. Through educational campaigns, workshops, and community engagement initiatives, they can inform the public about renewable energy options and their potential to improve quality of life. By advocating for policy changes and supporting local governments in implementing clean energy strategies, NGOs can help create an enabling environment for sustainable development.

Their ability to mobilize community support and foster collaboration among stakeholders is essential for the successful implementation of clean energy projects.

Identifying Opportunities for Carbon Credit Funding

Identifying opportunities for carbon credit funding requires a strategic approach that involves assessing local needs, understanding market dynamics, and aligning with regulatory frameworks. NGOs should begin by conducting thorough assessments of potential projects that could generate carbon credits. This may include renewable energy installations, reforestation efforts, or energy efficiency improvements.

By analyzing local resources and community needs, NGOs can pinpoint projects that not only have the potential to generate carbon credits but also address pressing social and environmental issues. Additionally, staying informed about the evolving landscape of carbon markets is crucial. This includes understanding the different types of carbon credit programs available, such as compliance markets and voluntary markets, as well as the specific requirements for each.

Engaging with experts in carbon finance can provide valuable insights into emerging trends and opportunities. By leveraging these insights, NGOs can position themselves to access funding sources that align with their mission and project goals.

Developing Projects to Utilize Carbon Credit Funds

Once opportunities for carbon credit funding have been identified, NGOs must focus on developing robust projects that can effectively utilize these funds. This involves creating detailed project proposals that outline objectives, methodologies, expected outcomes, and financial projections. A well-structured proposal not only demonstrates the feasibility of the project but also highlights its potential impact on both carbon reduction and community development.

Collaboration with local stakeholders is essential during the project development phase. Engaging community members in the planning process ensures that projects are designed with their needs in mind, increasing the likelihood of successful implementation. Additionally, involving local experts can enhance project credibility and effectiveness.

NGOs should also consider integrating monitoring and evaluation frameworks into their project designs to track progress and measure impact over time.

Building Partnerships with Private and Public Sectors

Building partnerships with both private and public sectors is critical for NGOs seeking to leverage carbon credit funds effectively. Collaborating with private companies can provide access to additional resources, expertise, and innovative technologies that can enhance project outcomes. For instance, partnerships with renewable energy firms can facilitate the deployment of solar panels or wind turbines in local communities, while also generating carbon credits.

Public sector partnerships are equally important, as they can help NGOs navigate regulatory landscapes and secure necessary permits for project implementation. Engaging with government agencies can also open doors to additional funding opportunities and support services. By fostering relationships with various stakeholders, NGOs can create a network of support that enhances their capacity to implement clean energy initiatives successfully.

Ensuring Compliance with Carbon Credit Standards and Regulations

Compliance with carbon credit standards and regulations is a critical aspect of successfully leveraging carbon credit funds. Each carbon credit program has specific requirements that must be met to ensure the credibility of the credits generated. NGOs must familiarize themselves with these standards, which may include guidelines set by organizations such as the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) or the Gold Standard.

To ensure compliance, NGOs should establish clear protocols for project implementation, monitoring, and reporting. This may involve conducting baseline assessments to measure existing emissions levels, implementing robust data collection methods during project execution, and preparing detailed reports for verification purposes. Engaging third-party auditors can also enhance credibility by providing independent assessments of project performance.

By prioritizing compliance, NGOs can build trust with stakeholders and maximize the value of the carbon credits generated.

Monitoring and Reporting on Clean Energy Impact

Monitoring and reporting on the impact of clean energy projects is essential for demonstrating accountability and transparency to stakeholders. Effective monitoring involves collecting data on key performance indicators (KPIs) related to both environmental outcomes (such as emissions reductions) and social benefits (such as improved access to energy). Establishing a baseline before project implementation allows NGOs to measure progress accurately over time.

Regular reporting is crucial for maintaining stakeholder engagement and attracting future funding opportunities. NGOs should develop comprehensive reports that highlight project achievements, challenges faced, and lessons learned. Utilizing visual aids such as graphs and infographics can enhance the clarity of reports and make them more engaging for diverse audiences.

By effectively communicating their impact, NGOs can strengthen their credibility and attract further support for their clean energy initiatives.

Engaging Communities in Clean Energy Projects

Community engagement is a cornerstone of successful clean energy projects. Involving local populations in every stage of project development fosters ownership and ensures that initiatives are aligned with community needs. NGOs should prioritize participatory approaches that encourage input from community members during planning sessions, implementation phases, and evaluation processes.

Educational initiatives play a vital role in community engagement as well. Providing training on renewable energy technologies not only empowers individuals with new skills but also fosters a sense of agency within the community. Workshops that demonstrate how clean energy solutions work can demystify technology and encourage adoption.

By actively involving communities in clean energy projects, NGOs can create lasting change that extends beyond mere access to energy.

Addressing Challenges and Risks in Leveraging Carbon Credit Funds

While leveraging carbon credit funds presents significant opportunities for NGOs, it also comes with challenges and risks that must be addressed proactively. Fluctuations in carbon credit prices can impact project viability; therefore, NGOs should develop financial models that account for potential market volatility. Diversifying funding sources beyond carbon credits can also mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single revenue stream.

Regulatory changes pose another challenge; staying informed about evolving policies is essential for ensuring compliance and adapting project strategies accordingly. Additionally, NGOs must be prepared to address potential community resistance or misunderstandings regarding clean energy technologies. Building trust through transparent communication and demonstrating tangible benefits can help alleviate concerns and foster community support.

Maximizing the Social and Environmental Benefits of Clean Energy Projects

To maximize the social and environmental benefits of clean energy projects, NGOs should adopt a holistic approach that considers both immediate impacts and long-term sustainability. This involves integrating social equity principles into project design to ensure that marginalized groups benefit from clean energy initiatives. For example, prioritizing access to renewable energy for low-income households can help reduce energy poverty while promoting environmental sustainability.

Furthermore, NGOs should explore opportunities for co-benefits that extend beyond emissions reductions. Clean energy projects can create jobs, stimulate local economies, and improve public health by reducing air pollution from traditional fossil fuels. By emphasizing these co-benefits in project proposals and communications, NGOs can attract broader support from stakeholders who recognize the multifaceted advantages of investing in clean energy solutions.

Examples of Successful Clean Energy Initiatives Supported by NGOs and Carbon Credit Funds

Numerous successful clean energy initiatives demonstrate the potential of leveraging carbon credit funds effectively. One notable example is the Solar Sister program in Africa, which empowers women entrepreneurs to distribute solar-powered products in their communities while generating carbon credits through emissions reductions associated with traditional kerosene lamps. This initiative not only provides access to clean energy but also promotes gender equality by supporting women’s economic empowerment.

Another example is the reforestation efforts led by organizations like Eden Reforestation Projects, which focus on restoring degraded forests while generating carbon credits through sustainable forestry practices. These projects not only sequester carbon but also create jobs for local communities involved in planting trees and maintaining forests. These examples illustrate how NGOs can successfully leverage carbon credit funds to implement impactful clean energy initiatives that address both environmental challenges and social needs.

RelyEZ is already doing that – proving that storage is not just technology, but the real estate of the energy era.","“Turning Energy Storage into Assets: RelyEZ’s Value for U.S. Investors”

At RE+ 2025 in Las Vegas, the conversation was not only about technologies on display but about the financial future of clean energy. Solar and wind are now mainstream, but it is energy storage that determines whether renewables can truly stand on their own. In this new reality, RelyEZ is positioning storage not as a supporting component, but as a bankable asset class – one that investors can treat like real estate: tangible, reliable, and revenue-generating.

With recognition as a Top 10 BESS provider by S&P Global, more than 15 GWh of projects already executed, and an annual capacity of 20 GWh, RelyEZ is proving it has both the scale and credibility to lead this transformation. Backed by BloombergNEF Tier-1 ratings and Munich Re insurance, the company is de-risking storage investments on a global level.

From Hardware to Bankable Assets

Asked what makes RelyEZ different, Uri, RelyEZ’s U.S. Business Development Manager, was clear:

“We don’t just deliver hardware – we deliver confidence. With our scale, technology, and execution, RelyEZ is setting new benchmarks for reliability and performance.”

That confidence comes from the company’s full-spectrum strategy. RelyEZ covers the entire lifecycle of a project:

Origination & design with grid-forming capabilities and immersive liquid-cooling

Financing & insurance backed by global partners such as Munich Re

Deployment & integration at utility and C/I scale

Operations & trading through the EnergyHub EMS and EnergyCloud AI platforms

Operations, trading & tokenization through the EnergyHub EMS, EnergyCloud AI platform, and RWA-ready solutions

By aligning the technical, financial, and operational layers, RelyEZ transforms projects into predictable, multi-revenue assets. This is what makes the company resilient even in turbulent times – tariffs, supply chain disruptions, or policy shifts.

Why Timing Matters

Global demand for storage is accelerating. The U.S. alone is forecasted to need tens of gigawatts of capacity by the end of the decade, driven by data center load, electrification, and grid reliability needs. For Uri, this creates a unique moment:

“Energy storage is no longer optional – it’s essential. The market is scaling fast, and RelyEZ is ready with bankable solutions. Partnering with us now means joining the growth of a company that is defining how energy storage becomes a financial asset class.”

Unlike many entrants chasing short-term opportunities, RelyEZ is building for longevity. With its bankability framework, investors can secure stable returns while utilities and developers gain confidence that assets will perform for decades.

The U.S. Strategy: Global Scale, Local Fit

RelyEZ’s U.S. market strategy combines global leadership with local alignment. Its solutions comply with U.S. standards, meet investor expectations, and adapt to regional project needs – from C/I to utility-scale.

Uri explained:

“We combine global best practices with U.S. compliance. From design to long-term O&M, we bring certainty to projects, ensuring they’re not only technically sound but also financially secure.”

This balance allows RelyEZ to serve as a bridge between global innovation and local execution.

The Depth of Full-Spectrum Energy Asset Management

Full-Spectrum Energy Asset Management is not a slogan – it is the foundation of RelyEZ’s resilience. It means projects are conceived, financed, insured, operated, and optimized under a single framework.

This model enables:

Predictable returns through multi-revenue market participation (frequency regulation, capacity markets, trading)

Operational stability through predictive maintenance and AI-driven monitoring

Risk reduction by integrating financing, insurance, and technology into one package

Uri emphasized:

“Even in the face of tariffs or policy uncertainty, our model keeps assets profitable. It’s about making energy storage as investable as traditional real estate.”

Looking Ahead

RelyEZ’s vision extends far beyond project delivery. It is about reshaping how storage is valued – moving it from a cost line item to an asset class in its own right. The company’s “three-car strategy” – leading in project development, construction, and long-term operation/trading – is already showing results across global markets, and the U.S. is its next major frontier.

As RE+ 2025 made clear, the companies that will define the next decade are not those who can simply build batteries, but those who can turn gigawatts into financial assets.

RelyEZ is already doing that – proving that storage is not just technology, but the real estate of the energy era.

TribCast: Will the Texas renewable energy powerhouse survive? | The Texas Tribune

The Texas Tribune does a deep dive on the latest Texas energy policy and ERCOT market developments with one of the smartest, most experienced people involved in the Texas market: Eric Goff of Goff Policy.

Eric Goff: Even if AI drops off, or if it doesn’t, I don’t think it matters…. there’s a continual loop of new load from new industries coming because they see cheap electricity which was made possible by solar and storage—because that’s how it gets cheap. That new demand increases prices, which increases the incentive for new solar and storage, and it’s this virtuous cycle. I don’t know what the next thing after AI is going to be, but the access to enormous amounts of cheap electricity will enable all kinds of potential…

Matt: Right. And you know it’s been so funny to watch, you know, folks like the abundance people talk about how, you know, these sort of liberal thinkers saying California, you’re doing it wrong. Look at Texas, right? It’s so much easier to get the permitting. It’s so much easier to get these projects off the ground because they stay out of people’s way and let these things build up.

Whatever the industries of the future will be, they’ll go where there’s abundant, cheap, clean, and reliable power. And for now at least, pending future policy decisions, that’s Texas.

Texas electricity demand didn’t set records this summer, but here’s why usage is up | The Dallas Morning News

Good summary of what I take to be a very healthy trend: lower annual peak demands each of the last two years while overall energy use has increased by historically very high levels.

[T]otal energy consumption is expected to grow more than 5% this year compared to last, which Vegas said is five times faster than the national average annual consumption growth rate between 2000 and 2020. Between 2010 and 2020, Texas had about double the national average growth rate ― but now that’s doubled again...

“We’re seeing higher system utilization, which is good for a lot of reasons,” Austin-based energy analyst Doug Lewin said. “It’s healthy for generators, it’s good for distributing costs across a wider base, and, of course, having those lower peaks and net peaks makes a big difference for grid reliability.”

Many energy industry leaders have called for an “all of the above” approach to generation. Consumption is being driven higher as Texas adds to its already rapid population growth, the boom of data centers extends its march and oil and gas operations rely more on electricity.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!epKo!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F440ccb65-7cd0-4708-94f2-6d0cfc5957d3_1656x1358.png",N,,2025-10-05 13:00:36.281861

Ormat Technologies signed a 25-year extension with the Southern California Public Power Authority to continue supplying 52 megawatts of renewable electricity from its Heber 1 geothermal power facility in Imperial Valley.

The agreement takes effect in February 2026 and runs through 2052, serving the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Imperial Irrigation District.

Geothermal energy, unlike solar or wind, provides a constant supply of baseload power by tapping heat stored beneath the Earth's surface. That reliability makes it especially valuable for cities seeking to diversify their clean energy mix and cut dependence on fossil fuels.

With the Heber 1 extension, the LADWP says the facility is expected to provide power to more than 77,000 households in Los Angeles.

The Heber complex was recently modernized after a fire incident forced a temporary shutdown in 2022. The repowering project replaced the facility's older water-cooled system with newer air-cooled technology, improving efficiency while reducing water demand in the arid Imperial Valley.

Together with its sister plant, Heber 1 will continue to generate about 91 MW of renewable electricity, which is enough to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people.

Ormat Technologies is based nearby in Reno, Nevada, and is one of the world's biggest companies in the field of alternative and renewable geothermal energy technology.

For communities, this deal means more than just reliable power. Expanding geothermal helps reduce pollution from fossil fuel plants, cutting emissions linked to respiratory illness and smog.

Stable, local clean energy also shields residents from the price volatility of natural gas, keeping energy bills more predictable over time. State and utility leaders framed the extension as both a climate action and an economic safeguard.

""Investing in geothermal energy is not just about meeting climate goals; it's a strategic decision that supports long-term energy security and environmental stewardship,"" said David Hanson, Senior Assistant General Manager of LADWP's Power System.

IID Board Chairwoman Gina Dockstader also welcomed the move, calling geothermal ""a reliable source of power"" for Imperial Valley and beyond.

These two eActros 600 trucks will bolster a growing fleet that should include 14 by the end of the year, with more on the way throughout 2026. The Mercedes-Benz eActros 600 is an electric long-haul truck designed specifically for heavy transport with an extensive range.

Running on a 621-kilowatt-hour battery, the eActros 600 has a range of 500 kilometers (311 miles) and is capable of hauling 22 tons over the full distance. It features a ProCabin chassis built with aerodynamics in mind to achieve its maximum range with a full payload.

In 2022, long-haul trucks in the United States produced 413 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, a 75% increase in 12 years, according to data provided by Statista. Replacing them with electric variations would have a tangible impact on annual CO2 pollution.

Currently, long-haul diesel trucks maintain a range advantage of 1,000 to 1,200 miles between fuel stops, compared to the eActros' 310 miles. However, even with the range gap shrinking, environmental considerations are changing the dynamics of the conversation.

Unsurprisingly, most people want to breathe cleaner air, and although replacing entire fleets of diesel semitrucks with electric alternatives will take time, the result is a brighter, cleaner future for everyone, without breaking the large-scale transportation business.

While range is a legitimate comparison, electric long-haul variations offer some unique advantages of their own, such as significantly reduced transportation costs and less noise pollution, the former generating an immediate impact on the costs of goods for consumers.

Gebrüder Weiss Holding AG is based in Austria, where market adoption of EV long-haul trucks is more straightforward. In the U.S., the approach is more varied and complex.

For instance, California's Advanced Clean Trucks Act, aimed at fleet electrification, was effectively stopped this year. Additionally, the U.S. Senate revoked a federal electric truck sales mandate.

A government shutdown will likely lead to further dismantling of federal environmental science, enforcement and conservation agencies, advocates warned this week.

Previous government shutdowns have seen federal employees furloughed until funding resumes. But this time, Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, has told federal agencies to prepare for widespread layoffs.

“That is fundamentally different,” said Jeremy Symons, a climate policy advisor for the Environmental Protection Agency during the Clinton administration, in a press call Monday hosted by the Environmental Protection Network. “The stakes of this year are different.”

The piecemeal, bipartisan funding bills Congress has put forth don’t include many of the deep cuts to these agencies the Trump administration requested. Symons pointed to the EPA funding bill that emerged from the Senate Appropriations Committee in July, which would force the Trump administration to re-establish the EPA’s Office of Research and Development and hire back the scientists laid off this year. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have also rejected the Trump administration’s plans to eliminate the research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.

Vought, an architect of conservative policy roadmap Project 2025, has signaled that the Trump administration would use a standoff as an opportunity to further shrink agencies that already have seen massive layoffs, resignations and retirements this year.

Executing layoffs during a shutdown is part of the Trump administration’s effort to unilaterally dismantle agencies responsible for environmental science and enforcement, said Symons, a senior advisor to the EPN, a group of former EPA staff.

“This is a bigger fight of whether or not Congress is going to actually be able to step up and stop this. Because it will just continue to happen,” Symons said.

Trump’s political opponents have suggested the administration doesn’t want a budget deal and is angling instead to take executive actions during the shutdown.

Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, “if it has to shut down, it’ll have to shut down.” On Sunday, he warned of “mass firings” in an NBC News interview. If the government shuts down, “we are going to cut a lot of the people that … we’re able to cut on a permanent basis,” he said.

It remains unclear how sweeping those cuts might be, who they would target or how they would stand up to likely challenges in court. Advocates for public health and the environment fear the cuts will target the same agencies already worn down by a confusing onslaught of layoffs, buyouts, re-hirings and legal challenges related to the administration’s downsizing agenda.

The White House referred questions on the shutdown’s impact on this work to the agencies. Representatives for the EPA and the commerce and interior departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the shutdown.

“I think the EPA is very susceptible to additional layoffs,” said Jeanne Briskin, former director of the EPA’s Office of Children’s Health Protection. She noted that expertise was already lost when the Trump administration eliminated the agency’s environmental justice office and its Office of Research and Development.

“The goal seems to be to remove the expertise and the experience necessary to implement our federal environmental protection laws, and so as long as there are people there who know how to do that, I think the goal is to strip that out as much as possible,” said Briskin, who retired in 2024 after 40 years at the EPA.

Other environmental groups have warned of threats to the national parks and the service that maintains them during a government shutdown. When the government partially shut down during the first Trump administration, national parks remained open and unstaffed for 35 days, leading to rampant vandalism, habitat destruction and accumulation of garbage.

Last week, 35 former superintendents of the National Park Service urged the government to close the parks if a shutdown occurs and prevent further degradation.

“If you don’t act now, history is not just doomed to repeat itself, the damage could in fact be much worse,” they wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

The letter said parks were already “pushed to the brink” by staffing and budget reductions this year. Both the National Park Service and the U.S. Forest Service were among the administration’s priority cuts as part of its “energy dominance” initiatives to increase production of oil, gas and minerals on public lands.

Conservation advocates have described the cutbacks as part of larger plans to dismantle the agencies so parks and forests can be privatized. The sale of public lands was part of the Project 2025 agenda.

“A government shutdown will make an already bad situation at national parks and public lands far worse,” said a statement issued Tuesday by the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks and the Association of National Park Rangers. “Already pushed to the brink by budget cuts and staff reductions, our parks are on an unsustainable and dangerous path.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1456778/story_image/AP25192620768017.jpg?1752597392,N,,2025-10-05 13:01:13.206562

But President Trump, a supporter of fossil fuel production, terminated the solar tax credit as part of his spending bill.
Solar companies say their business began picking up this summer with the news that the federal credit would be ending.
Hare and others expect a tapering off but not an abandonment of an energy system that no longer seems niche.
Like the federal tax credits, they’ve proved popular with consumers, he said.","Paula Dufour can watch the sun rise from the front porch of her Carroll County home and set from the porch in back. Soon, she anticipates, the solar panels that she is adding to her roof could capture so many of those passing rays that she’ll be considered a producer, not just a consumer of energy.

Dufour is among those getting in under the wire on a federal tax credit on solar energy systems that was ended by the Trump administration. With the credit expiring on Dec. 31, consumers and solar companies are racing to get installations completed in the final months of the year to save 30% of the cost.

“It’s sort of like a mad rush, losing-my-mind busy,” said Gailan Wensil-Strow, a vice president of American Sentry Solar, which is installing Dufour’s system. “I’m working everyone as much as I can. I’m asking, ‘Who can work Saturday?'”

The clock is ticking for those who haven’t started the process of selecting an installation company, applying for local government permits and arranging with BGE to connect to the power grid. Some companies have stopped taking orders in jurisdictions where permitting may take too long to get the installation done in time.

“With the change in the federal policy, we’ve seen a surge in interest,” said Tim Lattimer, administrator of Howard County’s Office of Community Sustainability. “People don’t like to leave money on the table.”

The county partners with a solar co-op, Switch Together, that leverages bulk-purchasing capacity to negotiate lower prices. Nearly 300 residents have accepted estimates and put down deposits, county officials said, filling the calendars of the three designated installation companies through the end of the year.

With some variations, the federal credit has been available since 2005, most recently as part of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that extended it through 2032. But President Trump, a supporter of fossil fuel production, terminated the solar tax credit as part of his spending bill. Passed in July, the bill also ended, as of Sept. 30, a tax credit of up to $7,500 for buying electric vehicles.

Trump has mocked clean energy as the “Green New Scam,” and called wind and solar worthless when it’s dark, ignoring the existence of battery storage. Nonetheless, renewables are part of the U.S. energy portfolio, while fossil fuels still dominate. In the first half of 2025, fossil fuels produced 58% of the nation’s electricity, while solar accounted for 11.2%, wind 10.8% and nuclear 18%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The solar credits have helped make the initial investment in a system more affordable, consumers and companies said.

“I need that third off,” said Dufour, 68, a retired electrical engineer and IT specialist.

She expects to get a $16,218 credit off the $54,060 cost of adding new panels and a storage battery to her 4-year-old solar system. She also is taking advantage of a $5,000 state grant for batteries.

Awaiting approval of her permit and expecting installation in November, Dufour said her expanded system will give her an 18-kilowatt capacity to fuel her all-electric ranch house. The battery will allow her to store energy, helpful during power outages when she would lose access to her well water.

“I’ll be independent,” she said. “I’ll be considered a small energy producer.”

She uses a phone app to monitor the amount of energy she produces and uses. Excess energy goes to BGE, she said, which then gives her a credit.

“I don’t really like fossil fuels,” Dufour said, despite hailing from Texas, where “oil is king. I’m a big advocate of solar.”

Another solar user, Alan Klein, 71, of Columbia, said his system makes both environmental and economic sense.

He said he’d been thinking “off and on” for years of going solar, but thought he’d have to chop down the mature trees that shade his home. But no trees were harmed in the project when it turned out panels could be installed on his detached garage’s roof.

With a tax credit of about $6,500, the cost of his system dropped to $15,500, he said, and the panels soon proved their value.

“My bills over the summer went from $200 to $35,” he said.

Factoring in the tax credit, the typical solar installation in Maryland begins to pay back in about six to eight years, said Sukrit Mishra, Switch Together’s program director for the capital region at its partner group, Solar United Neighbors, or SUN.

Switch Together works in 10 states, and is available in Howard, Montgomery and Frederick counties and the city of Bowie.

Solar companies say their business began picking up this summer with the news that the federal credit would be ending.

“For people who were dragging their feet for years … well, if they were going to do it, now’s the time,” said Zac Hare, vice president of residential sales for Lumina Solar.

His sales have soared as a result, to $64 million in the first nine months of this year, compared to $36 million during the same time period last year.

Hare and others expect a tapering off but not an abandonment of an energy system that no longer seems niche.

“I don’t think the market is over. I think it’s coming out of its infancy,” Wencil-Strow said. “Now it has to learn how to be a full industry without their parents supporting them.”

Kimberly Armstrong, co-founder of Baltimore Green Justice Workers Cooperative, said the tax credits “absolutely” helped homeowners who otherwise wouldn’t have been able to afford a solar system.

“You have a lot of people that want to participate but they couldn’t because it was not affordable or it was not accessible,” said Armstrong, whose company, Urban Clean Energy Advisors, offers energy consultation to help reach underserved communities.

Baltimore’s rowhouse-dominated landscape is not always as conducive to solar installation, she said, given that sloped rather than flat roofs are preferable. Additionally, some rowhouses may provide too small a job to attract some companies, she said.

“A lot of solar companies don’t want to work in Baltimore City because it’s not as profitable for them,” Armstrong said. “It’s only profitable if you have an entire block.”

Still, even in the city, this has been a boom year for solar. The city issued 403 permits for solar installations in the first nine months of this year, compared to 233 during the same time period last year. The number of permits has been trending upward since 2020, according to DHCD, when 100 were issued.

The city also is addressing what some companies said can be a lengthy permitting process and prioritizing solar applications, said Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the department.

“Additional engineers have also been brought in to review plans and applications in order to keep up with demand,” she said.

Advocates say solar will continue to attract homeowners at a time when both energy costs and demands on the grid, particularly from data centers, are rising. Consumers who switch to solar ultimately help reduce that strain, said Robin Dutta, executive director of the trade group, Chesapeake Solar and Storage Association.

“With utility rates going up as they are — and not stopping soon — [going solar] is one of the things consumers can do,” he said. “And it’s not just helping the homeowner, it’s helping the grid as well.”

With the end of the federal credits, some are looking to local and state governments to help make up the difference, and help the state achieve what are some of the nation’s most ambitious climate goals.

Eric Coffman, division director of energy programs at the Maryland Energy Administration, said Maryland has a range of incentives and rebates, although some have income and other restrictions. Like the federal tax credits, they’ve proved popular with consumers, he said.

“We are seeing a very significant uptick in our programs and applications for funding,” he said. “We have a full array of programs that aren’t going away.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lwQqW9sPhQa0Chk2hb5y9w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/baltimore_sun_tribune_local_552/ed5d8979f8911f5e90c867af48dd2294,N,,2025-10-05 12:01:47.711779

Climeworks said that at its flagship Mammoth plant in Iceland, which is thought to have a carbon capture capacity of 36,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the equipment captured just 750 tonnes in the first 10 months of operations.","Just a few years ago, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) was expected to be the saviour of the oil and gas industry, as major fossil fuel firms invested heavily in CCS activities aimed at decarbonising operations. Governments worldwide have encouraged companies to invest in CCS in recent years, funding green energy projects to help reduce the carbon emitted from oil and gas operations, and to allow countries to continue using fossil fuels to bridge the energy gap over the coming decades. However, as we see delays in the rollout of CCS projects and more evidence that suggests most CCS installations do not work as well as anticipated, many are questioning whether investing in this type of decarbonisation is viable.

CCS involves capturing carbon dioxide at emission sources, to be transported and stored or buried in a suitable deep, underground location. There is now a range of CCS technologies being used in fossil fuel and industrial operations worldwide, including conventional CCS installations and direct air capture (DAC), which removes CO2 directly from the atmosphere.

Following significant support from governments and fossil fuel companies worldwide, the CCS market could attract as much as $80 billion in investment by 2030, to support an anticipated 270 million tons of carbon dioxide capture a year. However, many scientists now suggest that financing CCS is a waste of money, as the technology does not work as effectively as previously expected, and it could detract from funding long-term green energy projects. A new report suggests that globally, the maximum reduction that CCS operations could achieve for the atmosphere would be 0.7 degrees Celsius, which is far short of the 5 Â°C to 6 Â°C industry and governments claim.

The U.K. has committed $40.5 billion to CCS technology in support of its net-zero emissions aims for 2050. The country hopes to find a way to reduce emissions in the mid-term as it gradually incorporates more renewable energy capacity into the energy mix, while it continues to rely heavily on oil and gas for power and heating. However, getting CCS projects off the ground has been no easy feat, with decades of delays under several governments.

The increased funding into CCS technology in recent years is supposed to have led to technological improvements and design innovation that will help suck more carbon from the sky. However, technology glitches and the high costs associated with installing CCS equipment have delayed projects and deterred companies from investing in CCS operations. Thilo Trabner, a business development manager for the Zurich-based CSS provider ABB, explained, ""First-of-a-kind technology challenges continue to contribute to delays in some projects, and reliance on subsidies and offtake agreements continues to play a critical role in project viability.""

Some of the projects for the U.K. include a gas power plant on Teesside in the north of England, which is expected to be operational by 2028, with plans to capture 95 percent of its emissions - around 2 million tonnes a year, and capacity to transport and store up to 4 million tonnes of carbon a year. Another three projects in the first round of the project pipeline are under negotiation, with plans to capture carbon from a methane-based blue hydrogen plant and energy from waste.

Related: Supermajors Slim Down to Protect Shareholder Payouts A government committee has questioned the cost-effectiveness of the planned CCS projects, warning against an over-reliance on CCS activities rather than investing in the country's long-term green energy goals. The government has already acknowledged that its target to capture between 20 and 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030 is no longer viable.

In Switzerland, one of the world's most well-known CCS companies, Climeworks, announced in May that it would be cutting its workforce by more than 10 percent, citing economic uncertainty and ""reduced momentum"" for CCS technology. Climeworks is famous for constructing the world's first DAC facilities. However, the company has come under fire as two of its flagship plants in Iceland were found to be capturing significantly less carbon than originally anticipated. Climeworks said that it was uncertain whether a third facility planned for the U.S. would go ahead due to the uncertain energy environment under President Trump.

DAC technology is much more expensive than conventional CCS equipment, but many companies have invested in DAC activities in recent years in response to government pressure to decarbonise. Now, recent reviews suggest that DAC technology is struggling to grow out of the pilot phase, as interest in the sector wanes. Climeworks said that at its flagship Mammoth plant in Iceland, which is thought to have a carbon capture capacity of 36,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the equipment captured just 750 tonnes in the first 10 months of operations.

The outlook for CCS technology is uncertain. In recent years, several governments, industries, and oil and gas companies have invested heavily in CCS technology in a bid to decarbonise. However, many of the planned projects have been delayed due to technological constraints and high costs. Now, reports on existing CCS activities suggest that the technology may not be working as successfully as anticipated, which has cooled investor interest in the sector and could cause progress in the CCS rollout to stall in the coming years.

Background and Context of Bangladesh’s Coastal Belt

Bangladesh’s coastal belt stretches along the southern edge of the country, encompassing a diverse range of ecosystems, including mangroves, wetlands, and sandy beaches. This region is not only rich in biodiversity but also supports a large population that relies on fishing, agriculture, and tourism for their livelihoods. However, the coastal belt is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, with rising sea levels and extreme weather events threatening both the environment and the communities that inhabit it.

The socio-economic conditions in this region are challenging. Many families live below the poverty line, lacking access to basic services such as electricity, clean water, and healthcare. Traditional energy sources, such as kerosene and firewood, are commonly used but pose health risks due to indoor air pollution and contribute to deforestation.

The need for sustainable energy solutions is urgent, as access to reliable electricity can significantly improve living conditions and economic opportunities for these communities.

The Need for Clean Energy in Bangladesh’s Coastal Belt

The reliance on traditional energy sources in Bangladesh’s coastal belt has far-reaching consequences. Not only do these sources contribute to environmental degradation, but they also perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality. Many households spend a significant portion of their income on energy costs, which limits their ability to invest in education, healthcare, and other essential services.

Furthermore, the lack of reliable electricity hampers local businesses and stifles economic growth. Clean energy solutions are essential for breaking this cycle. Access to renewable energy can enhance educational opportunities by providing lighting for evening study sessions and enabling the use of technology in schools.

It can also improve healthcare services by powering medical facilities and ensuring that vaccines are stored at appropriate temperatures. By transitioning to clean energy, we can create a healthier environment and foster economic development in the coastal belt.

Overview of Solar Energy as a Solution

Solar energy presents a viable solution to the energy challenges faced by Bangladesh’s coastal belt. With abundant sunlight throughout the year, this region is well-suited for solar power generation. Solar panels can be installed on rooftops or in community spaces, providing a decentralized energy source that is both sustainable and accessible.

Unlike traditional energy sources, solar power does not produce harmful emissions or contribute to climate change. Moreover, solar energy systems can be tailored to meet the specific needs of communities. From small-scale solar home systems that provide electricity for individual households to larger solar farms that can power entire villages, there are various options available.

The implementation of solar energy not only addresses immediate energy needs but also promotes long-term sustainability by reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

Goals and Objectives of the Grant Proposal

The primary goal of this grant proposal is to implement solar energy solutions in Bangladesh’s coastal belt to improve access to clean and reliable electricity for local communities. To achieve this goal, we have outlined several specific objectives: 1. Install solar energy systems in at least 500 households within the first year of the project.

2.

Provide training and capacity-building workshops for community members on solar technology maintenance and usage.

3. Raise awareness about the benefits of clean energy through community outreach programs.

4. Establish partnerships with local organizations to ensure sustainability and community involvement in project implementation.

By focusing on these objectives, we aim to create a lasting impact that empowers communities while promoting environmental sustainability.

Project Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented in several phases to ensure effective execution and community engagement. The first phase will involve conducting a needs assessment to identify target communities and understand their specific energy requirements. This will be followed by the installation of solar energy systems in selected households, with a focus on ensuring that installations are done by trained local technicians.

In parallel with the installation process, we will conduct training workshops for community members on how to operate and maintain solar systems. These workshops will not only provide technical knowledge but also foster a sense of ownership among residents. Community outreach programs will be organized to raise awareness about the benefits of solar energy and encourage participation in the project.

Budget and Financial Plan

A detailed budget has been developed to outline the financial requirements for implementing this project successfully. The total estimated cost is $250,000, which includes expenses for solar panel procurement, installation labor, training workshops, community outreach activities, and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.
The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company.
The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","BILLINGS, Mont. -- U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse.

Trump rejected climate change as a ""con job"" during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as ""beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed.

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,"" Paliwal said.

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually -- up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody's projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. ""The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""

According to the outlet, Pilot recently announced that it has opened more than 200 EV charging stations across almost 40 states, nearly halfway to its target of 500 sites and 2,000 fast-charging stalls. The stations are being built in partnership with GM and EVgo, with many located in rural areas where charging options have traditionally been scarce.

""Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,"" said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

The new stations are also designed with convenience in mind, placed at busy interstate travel centers — often with restaurants, Wi-Fi, and rest areas available where drivers plug in.

For EV owners, charging up at home remains the most affordable option, saving hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars each year compared to public fast charging. Public chargers can cost double or triple what it costs to recharge from your own outlet, which is why many drivers are also installing Level 2 chargers at home. Companies like Qmerit are helping to make the process simple, offering free estimates after a few quick questions about your electric panel and garage setup.

Nevertheless, expanding the highway network remains key to making EVs practical for everyone, from big cities to farm country. The ongoing adoption and adaptability of EVs is great for the planet as well — every mile driven on electricity helps to reduce the harmful pollution tied to gas-powered vehicles, which harms the health of our communities and increases global temperatures.

For those looking to stretch those savings even further, pairing home charging with the power of solar can really make a dent in your monthly bills as well.

Generating your own clean energy can power your car with sunlight and reduce your household's utility bills, and EnergySage can help you compare solar quotes for installation.

While it started from a lower base than many other countries, it is now outperforming even nations that began from a much stronger starting point. The Kingdom deliberately took time to lay solid foundations for clean energy growth toward 2030 and is now entering a dynamic take-off phase.

Saudi Arabia’s journey started in the last two decades and UNDP has been partnering with the Ministry of Energy for over 15 years to supercharge its sustainable energy objectives. UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Energy on the $100 million National Energy Efficiency Program, which resulted in the establishment of the Saudi Energy Efficiency Centre. Since 2019, UNDP worked with the Ministry of Energy to build capacity, advance renewable energy integration and deliver techno-economic analysis of new renewable resources. UNDP has also worked closely with the Ministry to study R&Dresearch and development priorities in the power sector and facilitated delegations to study international best practices.

UNDP has partnered with the Ministry of Energy for over 15 years to supercharge its sustainable energy objectives.

Saudi Arabia is preparing to remain a global energy leader through growth in affordable and sustainable energy. It aims for 50% renewable electricity by 2030, driven by its National Renewable Energy Program (NREP), and underpinned by its Net Zero by 2060 goal. The Kingdom is also improving environmental outcomes whilst saving costs through the Liquid Displacement Program, where cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity replace Heavy Fuel Oil and diesel.

In addition to its successful energy efficiency efforts over the last 15 years, Saudi Arabia is deploying solar energy at a faster rate than any country in history. The first large-scale, grid-connected utility solar PV project under the NREP was the 300 MW Sakaka PV IPP in November 2019. Developed by ACWA Power, Sakaka marked Saudi Arabia’s entry into utility-scale solar power production feeding directly into the national electricity grid. Since then, it has connected over 10.2 GW of renewable capacity and has over 33 GW in different stages of the development pipeline. It aims to tender 20 GW of renewables annually to achieved 2030 targets subject to electricity demand growth.

Saudi Arabia is deploying solar energy at a faster rate than any country in history.

This new, clean electricity will not only decarbonize the country’s grid, but it will also help to decarbonize the factories and transport systems of Europe and the Far East, by producing and exporting green hydrogen made from water and renewable electricity. With the ambition to be a major player in Artificial Intelligence data centers, it will also help decarbonize AI and digital infrastructure.

Beyond wind and solar, the Kingdom is exploring its vast geothermal potential along the Red Sea coast where tectonic activity is highest. This could provide reliable, renewable baseload power and capitalize on the country’s strong experience with drilling and subsurface mapping.

Research into civil nuclear power is also ongoing. Saudi hosts national civil nuclear research centres at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (KACARE), alongside nuclear engineering degrees at three leading universities.

Saudi is confident in its trajectory because it has carefully built a strong foundation that de-risks clean energy investments and will lead to the lowest renewable energy costs in the world. It is deploying 1,200 “meteorological masts” (weather stations) across the country to develop a national database of wind and solar patterns covering an area of 850,000 km2. These reliable measurements build confidence in expected generation, improve revenue forecasts, reduce project development timelines, and de-risk new projects, which lowers the cost of capital for project finance.

Saudi is confident in its trajectory because it has carefully built a strong foundation that de-risks clean energy investments and will lead to the lowest renewable energy costs in the world.

Building solar panels, wind turbines and manufacturing clean energy value chain components are important foundational steps. But operating a robust electricity grid safely and reliably adds a layer of complexity to the energy transition that is often underappreciated.

Saudi Arabia is now complementing its healthy pipeline of renewable energy projects with a renewables integration plan that aims to leapfrog the world’s fastest adopters. This includes large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) to enhance grid flexibility and reliability, enabling higher penetration of renewables. Saudi Arabia has already operated four BESS projects with a total capacity of 2GW / 8GWh. In addition, the country is developing a pipeline of 5.5 GW / 22 GWh of additional BESS projects, with a national target of reaching 48 GWh of storage capacity by 2030 as a part of its energy mix. And it has engaged the national energy ecosystem to develop a shared list of research, development and innovation priorities for the power sector, which will inform where and how the Research, Development and Innovation Authority should invest.

Lessons emerging from the long-standing partnership between the Saudi Ministry of Energy and UNDP highlight the importance of establishing a strong foundation from the outset—anchored in sound public policies and robust regulatory frameworks. Such a foundation enables the rapid scaling of clean energy–for–development initiatives supported by sustainable financing and investment. This approach has positioned Saudi Arabia to further consolidate its regional leadership in the energy space, demonstrating how energy can drive economic transformation and setting an example by fostering a holistic approach to the energy sector both domestically and across borders.",https://www.undp.org/themes/custom/undpglobal/images/meta-undp-logo.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 13:01:02.731577

On Sept. 30, a federal subsidy worth up to $7,500 expired as part of President Trump’s spending bill, making a new EV decidedly more expensive – at least in theory. As it turns out, some car makers themselves will continue to offer the discount, at least for a limited time.

GM, Ford and Hyundai will still offer the deals on some models, with the Korean car maker dropping the price of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by as much as $9,800.

Kelley Blue Book Executive Editor Brian Moody told Nexstar he’s optimistic that other automakers may follow suit.

“I would wait like a week or two, because I know that within that time period some automakers and some dealers are going to come up with a way of discounting those cars,” Moody said. “Maybe it’s going to be a super low payment lease with no money down. Maybe it’s going to be super low financing or something like that.”

Moody also recommends considering a used EV.

“Many used electric cars are just really priced right, like they’re really good deals, because new electric vehicles tend to depreciate very rapidly,” Moody said, adding that fears over the battery failing are largely unfounded.

“Of course, you’re going to have some that do that, but most EVs have a warranty of at least 8 yeas or 100,000 miles,” Moody said.

As for the future of electric vehicles in the United States under the Trump administration, carmakers are tempering expectations.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” Ford Motor CEO Jim told an audience in Detroit Wednesday, according to CNBC. “We’re going to find out in a month.

The Tennessee Valley Authority agreed to buy electricity from a small nuclear power plant that’s expected to go into service in 2030 and will help power data centers owned by Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

Kairos Power LLC is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee and also plans to construct a 50-megawatt version that may be the first advanced reactor to go into service in the US, according to a statement from August. Terms weren’t disclosed.

TVA will be the first US utility to buy power from an advanced reactor, a move that shows growing confidence in the nuclear industry’s ability to build new types of power plants. Technology companies are clamoring for energy for data centers that are running artificial intelligence systems. That’s driving up demand for electricity, especially clean power from reactors. This agreement follows Kairos’ October deal to supply power to Google.

Kairos is developing a reactor that uses molten fluoride salt as a coolant instead of water typically used in conventional nuclear plants. That will allow Kairos’ facility to operate at higher temperatures so it captures more energy from the fission reaction.

Ford, GM Reportedly Extending EV Incentives

Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) are reportedly extending the EV incentives offered to customers through December. The companies have made the extension possible by making down payments to dealers via their respective financing arms before September 30 to qualify the units for the credit.

The dealers would then pass the benefits of this credit to owners when they're purchasing the vehicles. It could also lead to lower monthly payments.

Stellantis, Hyundai, Lucid To Also Extend Incentives

Meanwhile, Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA), which also has an HQ in Michigan, will also be extending the incentives on EVs like Ford and GM, according to the Detroit Free Press on Thursday. However, unlike its crosstown rivals, the automaker is offering the EV incentive as a cash bonus on existing dealer inventory.

Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. (OTC:HMLYF) has also announced it will extend the EV incentives on its Ioniq 5 EV, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. The company has also cut the prices of the Ioniq 5.

Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) also announced it would be extending the EV credit offered on its vehicles till the end of the year, according to the company’s interim CEO Marc Winterhoff, who shared that the company had several orders and didn’t want buyers to miss out on savings during an interview with Brew Markets last month.

Tesla, Rivian, Honda, Toyota Offer No Extensions

Elsewhere, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN), Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (NYSE:HMC), as well as Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) are offering no extensions on the EV credit.

Tesla had urged customers to lock in their purchases by paying a fee via a nominal down payment or trade-in on or before September 30, as updated IRS terms said that customers can take delivery after the deadline, too, provided a purchase agreement was in place on or before September 30.

Former Tesla Sales Chief Thinks EV Sales Will Grow Without Incentives

Interestingly, Jon McNeill, former Tesla President for Global Sales and Service, who currently serves as a member of the GM board, said that EV sales in the U.S. would grow despite the rolling back of incentives by Trump. He highlighted that the availability of models by manufacturers, as well as affordable options, will drive adoption in the country.

Gene Munster Thinks EV Makers Would Benefit From Trump's Pro-Gasoline Stance

Meanwhile, Deepwater Asset Management's investor Gene Munster says that EV makers like Tesla would benefit from anti-EV measures like the end of the tax credit, as it lessens the incentive for traditional automakers to invest in developing EVs, giving EV companies a scale advantage.

Wildfire risk and the capacity to address the challenge are going in opposite directions.
Deregulation and disinvestment may ultimately exacerbate wildfire risk.","The western United States is facing another destructive wildfire season, with more acres burned in Colorado alone in 2025 than in the past four years combined. If global warming continues on its current trajectory, the amount of forest area burned each year could double or even triple by midcentury.

In other words, more fire is coming, more often.

As U.S. forests burn, Congress and federal agencies are asking an important question: What role should federal land management play in reducing fire risk?

About two-thirds of forest land in the western U.S. is publicly owned, with the majority of it managed by federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. These public lands are treasured for recreation, wildlife habitat, timber production and open space. They are also where many of today’s largest fires burn.

Historically, lightning- and human-ignited fires kept forests less dense and reduced forest litter and undergrowth that can easily burn. While some controlled burning continues today, the violent displacement of Native people, criminalization of Indigenous fire stewardship and more than a century of federal fire suppression have largely removed fire as a critical ecological process in fire-prone forests, leaving fuel to accumulate.

When those forests burn today, the result is often hotter and more severe fires that elude any attempt at control. And rising global temperatures are raising the risk.

Several of the current federal proposals for managing fire risk focus on increasing timber harvesting on federal lands as a solution. They also propose speeding up approvals for those projects by limiting environmental reviews and public oversight.

As experts in fire science and policy, we see some useful ideas in the proposed solutions, but also reasons for concern.

While cutting trees can help reduce the severity of future fires, it has to include thinning in the right places to make a difference. Without oversight and public involvement, increasing logging could skip areas with low-value trees that need thinning and miss opportunities for more effective fire risk-reduction work.

Harvesting timber to reduce fire risk

President Donald Trump cited wildfire risk in his March 2025 executive order calling for “an immediate expansion of American timber production.” And the U.S. Forest Service followed with a commitment to increase timber sales on federal land by 25% over the next four years.

Trump, federal officials and members of Congress who are advancing legislation such as the Fix Our Forests Act have also called for speeding up approval of timber-harvesting projects by reducing public comment periods on proposals, limiting environmental analyses of the plans and curtailing the ability of groups to sue to block or change the projects in court.

These proposals are often framed as pragmatic solutions to clear the way for action to reduce fire risk faster. The urgency is real, and this argument can seem intuitive. No one wants burdensome processes to stand in the way of reducing wildfire damage. But it’s important to take a hard look at the problem and real solutions.

Environmental reviews aren’t the problem

Research shows that environmental reviews are rarely the main barrier to forest projects aimed at reducing fire risk.

The bigger obstacles are the shrinking of the federal forest workforce over the past two decades, the low commercial value of the small trees and brush that need to be removed, and the lack of contractors, processing facilities and markets for low-value wood.

Data from the U.S. Forest Service supports these conclusions.

Between 2005 and 2018, over 82% of the U.S. Forest Service’s land management projects were approved using categorical exclusions. Categorical exclusions allow agencies to skip environmental assessments and are the fastest and least burdensome form of National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, review, with limited analysis or opportunity for public involvement.

Less than 1% of the projects were challenged in court, and most of those challenges targeted the largest and most complex projects, where public oversight and analysis are critical to getting it right on the ground, such as large mining operations or forest management projects that would cover hundreds of thousands of acres.

An analysis of the bulk of U.S. Forest Service land management projects between 2009 and 2021 found that complying with NEPA took between 7% and 21% of the projects’ timelines, often shorter than the timelines for issuing contracts.

Some degree of planning, intergovernmental coordination and public involvement must happen before starting a fuel-reduction project to know where the work is appropriate and necessary.

Why reviews and public oversight matter

What would be lost if environmental-analysis and public-involvement requirements were curtailed?

Oversight helps ensure that projects happen where they are needed to reduce fire risk. Without that, political and economic pressures can lead to more forest thinning in locations where there are mills and valuable timber – rather than in the areas where wildfire risk is higher but the trees aren’t as valuable.

Environmental review and public comment are among the few tools communities have to shape fire-mitigation projects.

These processes also ensure that the work doesn’t stop at federal boundaries. And they help partners, such as community organizations, state agencies and local fire departments, plan and work together.

Oversight doesn’t just protect the environment — it enables funding and partnerships, safeguards communities and builds shared ownership of adapting to fire.

Solutions that work

So, what can Congress and the federal government do to reduce fire risk to communities? The answer starts with investing in forest management and projects that can reduce fire risk.

Joint projects involving communities and state, tribal and local agencies, like those under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program, build partnerships to reduce fire risk across large landscapes and lower the risk of fire spreading to homes and federal wildlands. The Good Neighbor Authority, created in 2001, enables federal agencies to contract with states, counties and tribes to provide forest management work on federal lands.

Yet federal funding for state, tribal and private forest management is on the chopping block. Wildfire risk and the capacity to address the challenge are going in opposite directions.

The Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, a bipartisan group of fire professionals, scientists, tribes, land managers and local officials, recently released recommendations for improving fire management that call for greater funding and collaboration at all levels to reduce the fire risk. The report emphasizes the importance of proactive solutions driven by local communities, shared decision-making and better use of prescribed fire. Achieving these goals will require sustained collaboration across jurisdictions and sectors, with communities engaged as full partners in the process.

Forest and fire management are complex jobs. It is reasonable to yearn for quick solutions to the wildfire crisis, but it’s important that any fixes lead to lasting progress. Deregulation and disinvestment may ultimately exacerbate wildfire risk.

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›

Cars are continually becoming smarter as automakers integrate more advanced safety and semi-autonomous systems into their products every year. All types of vehicles, including those with combustion engines, are incorporating these features. However, electric vehicles (EVs) are uniquely suited for advanced technology, as they're built on software systems.

That's creating a huge opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company has been building automotive tech solutions for years, and as electric vehicles become more commonplace, a massive opportunity is coming into focus for Nvidia's artificial intelligence tech to power the next generation of EVs.

How Nvidia's powering next-gen vehicles today

For years, Nvidia developed technology platforms and systems for vehicles in anticipation that one day they'd become an integral part of advanced vehicle systems. Those days are already here.

Nvidia's artificial intelligence platform DRIVE AGX and its AI vehicle processors DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Thor are being used by leading electric-vehicle companies to enhance in-vehicle software, safety systems, and semi-autonomous capabilities.

For example, the world's largest EV maker, BYD, partnered with Nvidia several years ago to use Nvidia's centralized computing platform to bring ""safe and intelligent vehicles to market."" Similarly, China-based Xiaomi EV built its SU7 sedan with Nvidia's DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions and uses AI to make navigation decisions in unknown driving environments.

American companies are tapping into Nvidia's DRIVE technology, as well. Electric-vehicle specialist Rivian uses it to enhance its safety features and driving technology, and also uses Nvidia's RTX Pro GPUs to power artificial intelligence and virtual reality for vehicle design.

Most recently, General Motors announced a new partnership with Nvidia, saying that it has used the tech giant's graphics processor for AI training in the past -- and is now expanding its partnership to include in-vehicle hardware and even assisting with the design of automotive plants and operations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of the partnership, ""The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we're transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they're made.""

This is just scraping the surface of Nvidia's hardware and software integration into electric vehicles and semi-autonomous safety systems. In all, more than 20 automakers use Nvidia's processors and DRIVE platform to help power their next-generation vehicles.

The next-gen vehicle opportunity is massive for Nvidia

One of the biggest opportunities for Nvidia from next-gen vehicles is for automakers to increasingly use it to power autonomous vehicles. GM made this point clear when talking about its future vision for its own vehicles and its expectation to launch personal autonomous vehicles, or PAVs, in the future.

GM's senior VP of Software and Services Engineering Dave Richardson said, ""The work we're doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes.""

Nvidia announced a new full-stack DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform that's in full production now, with plans to deploy into intelligent transportation systems soon. In short, Nvidia's tech could help make these new autonomous systems a reality. And the opportunity is massive.

""We believe automotive is a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia,"" said Ali Kani, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of automotive.

The company's not quite there yet. Its automotive revenue was just $586 million in Q2, though it did improve by an impressive 69% from the year-ago quarter. But some estimates put the projected revenue for autonomous vehicle platform providers near $2.6 trillion globally by 2030 -- making this a huge opportunity for Nvidia.

Worth the wait

Most new vehicles, electric and otherwise, have some level of semi-autonomous systems built into them these days. As these features become more commonplace and companies expand their in-vehicle technologies for EVs, Nvidia's current partnerships and tech make it well-positioned to benefit from the growth.

Considering that Nvidia is already a dominant artificial intelligence company that's tapping into huge demand for AI data centers, investors can benefit from owning Nvidia stock now -- while they wait for the company to benefit from powering next-gen vehicles in the coming years.

Now, There's A Solution",Iulian Dnistran,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/774611/vw-id3-id4-skoda-enyaq-battery-preconditioning-mod/,"Many of the early MEB-based Volkswagen Group EVs don’t have a battery preconditioning feature, despite the cars having the necessary hardware for it.
Without battery preconditioning, fast charging in cold climates can be very time-consuming.
Instead, the EV’s brain uses the heater and coolant pump to keep the battery temperature from dropping too low, but that’s it.
Additionally, there’s no way of knowing what the preconditioning system is doing—what’s the battery temperature or what state the heater is in, this sort of thing.
Until that happens, though, the first iteration with the USB-C cable is the best solution for Volkswagen, Skoda and Cupra EV owners who desperately need battery preconditioning.","Many of the early MEB-based Volkswagen Group EVs don’t have a battery preconditioning feature, despite the cars having the necessary hardware for it.

The Volkswagen ID.3, ID.4 and ID. Buzz, as well as the Skoda Enyaq and Cupra Born are among the affected models.

Without battery preconditioning, fast charging in cold climates can be very time-consuming. Now, though, there’s a solution.

The first batch of Volkswagen’s modern electric cars was not without fault. Many of the issues were eventually solved through software updates, but one major sticking point is still there for early customers of cars like the Volkswagen ID.4 and Skoda Enyaq.

In MEB-based EVs assembled anywhere from 2021 to early 2024, there is no way to preheat the high-voltage battery pack before plugging into a DC fast charger. As a result, it will take longer to charge when it’s cold outside because the battery restricts power if it’s not at the ideal temperature.

What makes it even more frustrating is the fact that these cars have all the hardware needed to keep the battery at the right temperature. There’s just no way to manually turn on preconditioning. Instead, the EV’s brain uses the heater and coolant pump to keep the battery temperature from dropping too low, but that’s it.

In newer cars with the latest software, owners can preheat the battery by tapping on the screen. Now, though, there’s a solution for pre-2024 MEB EVs too—you’ll just have to build it yourself.

Thankfully, it’s not too difficult. The solution, which was created by security engineer Fredrik Gustafsson, comes in the form of a small circuit board that taps into the car’s battery management system (BMS) harness. Gustafsson has instructions on his GitHub page, but here’s the gist of it.

The small circuit board that sends commands to the BMS needs to be programmed using a separate USB dongle. After the software is loaded onto the board, it needs to be connected to an extension cable that taps into the BMS connector, which is located behind the glovebox. Altogether, the parts cost roughly $40 to $50, plus the time it takes to build it all.

Here’s where things get a little inelegant. To activate the battery heater and associated coolant pump, the little circuit board needs to be powered from a USB power source via a USB-C cable. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s not exactly modern, either. Additionally, there’s no way of knowing what the preconditioning system is doing—what’s the battery temperature or what state the heater is in, this sort of thing.

Please note: Messing with your car's BMS is risky business, and doing this probably will void any warranties. We can't exactly recommend you go this route.

At the same time, Gustafsson says that the car has all the necessary failsafes in place to prevent any damage from happening. So when the battery reaches the right temperature, the heater turns off.

More details can be found on the creator’s GitHub page, as well as on the VWIDTalk forum. And there’s more good news, too. Gustafsson already has a second, more refined version of his system, which uses a smartphone app to control the battery heater and monitor all the information. Although version 2 is functional, Gustafsson said that he hasn’t figured out a way to reliably distribute the parts, as the circuit board for this second attempt is custom-made.

Until that happens, though, the first iteration with the USB-C cable is the best solution for Volkswagen, Skoda and Cupra EV owners who desperately need battery preconditioning.

Whether it is a beautiful bill from an investment standpoint is in the eye of the beholder. Like most new legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) has winners and losers.

A larger tax credit, a bigger tax deduction, a more sizable write-off, a less-onerous regulation, or a booster shot from increased government spending can lift profits for companies that benefit.

On the flip side, the end of a sizable subsidy, the phasing out of a tax break or major cuts to government programs can impair sales, resulting in earnings headwinds for negatively affected companies.

Below, we list some of the biggest investment beneficiaries of Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, and some of its victims, too. Prices and returns are as of July 31.

Play offense with defense

Trump's signature legislation delivered on his promise to spend more to strengthen the military. OBBBA increases defense spending by $150 billion, pushing the U.S. defense budget for fiscal year 2026 over $1 trillion, the largest in U.S. history.

A sizable chunk of the money will go toward priorities such as the Golden Dome missile defense shield. Other imperatives include building naval ships and developing next-generation munitions and unmanned drone weaponry, as well as replenishing weapons stockpiles.

Increased military spending by European allies and unstable geopolitics add to the case for the defense sector.

You don't have to be an army general to conclude that weapons-related companies have a tailwind. ""The defense industry is an overwhelming winner,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management.

Investors looking to boost exposure to the defense sector can mimic a precision-guided smart bomb and try to pinpoint individual stocks, or they can take a cluster-bomb approach and gain access to a wider array of munitions makers through a diversified exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the sector.

Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA Research, likes the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which is up 36% this year and holds about 40 stocks, including top holdings such as GE Aerospace (GE), RTX (RTX), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT).

Another option is the Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA), up 27% in 2025. Holdings include top defense contractors plus tech stocks with Pentagon ties, such as Palantir (PLTR), a data analytics company that uses artificial intelligence to support military operations and intelligence gathering.

Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), a leading shipbuilder that earns 80% of its revenue from the U.S. Navy, ""stands to benefit from the Department of Defense's renewed focus on expanding the Navy's fleet size,"" says CFRA analyst Matthew Miller, who rates the stock a Buy.

Seth Meyer, global head of client portfolio management at Janus Henderson Investors, is bullish on Howmet Aerospace (HWM). Its specialized aircraft components get kudos for being lighter, faster, stronger and more cost-effective.

Howmet's parts helped land the Apollo spacecraft on the moon and are used in military aircraft, such as Lockheed Martin's drones and F-35 fighter jet. The stock is a top-10 holding in the Janus Henderson Forty and Janus Henderson Contrarian funds.

Surf the reshoring wave

It's no secret that Trump wants companies to build their products on U.S. soil. The OBBBA offers tax incentives for firms to embrace the ""Made in America"" policy. ""The bill is incentivizing behavior change,"" says Meyer.

Growth-friendly OBBBA provisions include making permanent a 100% bonus depreciation — a type of tax break that allows companies to deduct a percentage of the purchase price of eligible assets.

Companies can now deduct the entire cost (up from 40% previously) of qualifying property, such as machinery and equipment, in the year it's put into service — no need to spread deductions over multiple years and wait to realize the tax benefits.

The new law also allows full expensing of domestic research-and-development expenses in the year they occur, cutting corporate tax bills and boosting cash flow.

Another perk aimed at encouraging investment in the homeland is 100% expensing, or immediate deductions, for certain manufacturing spending, such as upgrades to factories or assembly lines.

Manufacturing and heavy-machinery businesses such as Deere (DE) and Caterpillar (CAT) will benefit if customers spend more on capital equipment due to savings on taxes, says Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management.

""If I need a new tractor, I'm going to invest while I know [the tax breaks] are on the books,"" he says. For broad exposure to the industrials sector, Stanley likes the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ), a fund that owns about 200 stocks.

Among individual stocks, consider Trane Technologies (TT), best known for its energy-efficient HVAC systems, says Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management.

Trane is likely to see higher demand from customers with more cash to plow into their business thanks to the OBBBA tax breaks, Teal says. Another plus: Trane has limited tariff risk, says Morningstar analyst Brian Bernard. (Trane is a member of the Kiplinger ESG 20, our favorite stocks and funds with an environmental, social or governance focus.)

Vulcan Materials (VMC), a producer of construction materials such as crushed stone, sand, gravel, asphalt and concrete, is a top pick of Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at wealth management firm Villere & Co. ""There's going to be a big tailwind with all the incentives for U.S. manufacturing,"" he says.

Catch the AI train

The new law is a potential accelerant for the already fast-growing artificial intelligence business.

""Getting semiconductor production on-shore is a key strategic focus of the Trump 2.0 administration,"" says Meyer. The OBBBA gives semiconductor makers incentives to break ground before 2026 on new plants to build high-powered chips.

The carrot? Boosting the tax credit to 35% from 25%.

Capital Group portfolio manager Matt Hochstetler says tech stocks that can benefit include Micron Technology (MU) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). (The latter is liable for U.S. corporate taxes and qualifies for the credit.)

There will be losers

Trump is not a big backer of clean energy. The OBBBA's December 31 phase-out of the tax credit allowing homeowners to deduct 30% of the cost of installing solar panels from federal taxes could lead to a 20% to 30% drop in home solar installations, denting the sales of U.S. solar panel makers, according to CPA firm Cerini & Associates.

And the end of the $7,500 tax credit on September 30 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle will cut into EV sales.

Sizable cuts to Medicaid are a negative for hospitals that treat low-income patients. Such hospitals may face lower revenues due to fewer patients, and they risk not getting paid by patients who lose coverage. The cuts will also harm health insurers that derive a large chunk of their revenue from Medicaid plans.

That's creating a huge opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) leader Nvidia (NVDA -0.77%). The company has been building automotive tech solutions for years, and as electric vehicles become more commonplace, a massive opportunity is coming into focus for Nvidia's artificial intelligence tech to power the next generation of EVs.

How Nvidia's powering next-gen vehicles today

For years, Nvidia developed technology platforms and systems for vehicles in anticipation that one day they'd become an integral part of advanced vehicle systems. Those days are already here.

Nvidia's artificial intelligence platform DRIVE AGX and its AI vehicle processors DRIVE Orin and DRIVE Thor are being used by leading electric-vehicle companies to enhance in-vehicle software, safety systems, and semi-autonomous capabilities.

For example, the world's largest EV maker, BYD, partnered with Nvidia several years ago to use Nvidia's centralized computing platform to bring ""safe and intelligent vehicles to market."" Similarly, China-based Xiaomi EV built its SU7 sedan with Nvidia's DRIVE Orin configuration for highway driving functions and uses AI to make navigation decisions in unknown driving environments.

American companies are tapping into Nvidia's DRIVE technology, as well. Electric-vehicle specialist Rivian uses it to enhance its safety features and driving technology, and also uses Nvidia's RTX Pro GPUs to power artificial intelligence and virtual reality for vehicle design.

Most recently, General Motors announced a new partnership with Nvidia, saying that it has used the tech giant's graphics processor for AI training in the past -- and is now expanding its partnership to include in-vehicle hardware and even assisting with the design of automotive plants and operations. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said of the partnership, ""The era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we're transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they're made.""

This is just scraping the surface of Nvidia's hardware and software integration into electric vehicles and semi-autonomous safety systems. In all, more than 20 automakers use Nvidia's processors and DRIVE platform to help power their next-generation vehicles.

The next-gen vehicle opportunity is massive for Nvidia

One of the biggest opportunities for Nvidia from next-gen vehicles is for automakers to increasingly use it to power autonomous vehicles. GM made this point clear when talking about its future vision for its own vehicles and its expectation to launch personal autonomous vehicles, or PAVs, in the future.

GM's senior VP of Software and Services Engineering Dave Richardson said, ""The work we're doing with companies like Nvidia adds agility to our already highly sophisticated vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing processes.""

Nvidia announced a new full-stack DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform that's in full production now, with plans to deploy into intelligent transportation systems soon. In short, Nvidia's tech could help make these new autonomous systems a reality. And the opportunity is massive.

""We believe automotive is a trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia,"" said Ali Kani, Nvidia's vice president and general manager of automotive.

The company's not quite there yet. Its automotive revenue was just $586 million in Q2, though it did improve by an impressive 69% from the year-ago quarter. But some estimates put the projected revenue for autonomous vehicle platform providers near $2.6 trillion globally by 2030 -- making this a huge opportunity for Nvidia.

Worth the wait

Most new vehicles, electric and otherwise, have some level of semi-autonomous systems built into them these days. As these features become more commonplace and companies expand their in-vehicle technologies for EVs, Nvidia's current partnerships and tech make it well-positioned to benefit from the growth.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/834068/red-cars-under-construction-factory-1733213138.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 14:00:48.969746

That satisfying mix of science and serendipity is backed by strategy, said Michael Mazzola, the executive director of Future Use of Energy in Louisiana.
In FUEL’s case, its focus ensures Louisiana’s role in the future of energy — a foundational building block of modern life.
“The evidence is that targeted investments here connect innovators to entrepreneurs — and you see companies like Encore CO₂ form because the pieces are already nearby.” Can energy’s past be part of the energy future?
“And we need a world-class Louisiana workforce to do it.” The company points to a growing CCS pipeline and storage network stretching across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.","A Louisiana State University chemical engineering professor perfected electrolyzers that turn waste carbon dioxide into useful stuff.

At a local gym in Baton Rouge, he met the entrepreneur behind a nearby craft brewery. Joined by a risk-tolerant PhD coming back home, they formed Encore CO₂, a company that is using a hard seltzer product to demonstrate its other industrial uses for repurposing a waste product into a resource.

That satisfying mix of science and serendipity is backed by strategy, said Michael Mazzola, the executive director of Future Use of Energy in Louisiana.

FUEL is a consortium created to administer one of the National Science Foundation’s Regional Innovation Engines: a program that was billed as putting up to $1.6 billion into almost a dozen regional efforts to advance applied science.

Like the EDA Tech Hubs program, its US Dept. of Commerce cousin, the NSF Engines program is a well-regarded bipartisan test of modern industrial policy — government investments into favored industries. Whether both can survive, or even grow, under successive presidential administrations is a bellwether on the question of how the United States can respond to a perceived challenge from the Chinese Communist Party to “overwhelm” Americans in science and technology. That the Trump administration opened a funding call to tech hubs is a good signal, but the National Science Foundation has received even cuts than the Commerce Department, one federal budget watcher told me this month.

For now, FUEL is among the program’s bright lights: an “ecosystem approach” in a reliably Republican state that pairs serious scientific research with hard-charging entrepreneurship, reliable corporate stewardship and responsive workforce development.

Encore CO₂ is one of Mazzola’s first case studies, as FUEL invested a $200,000 grant into the startup. He’ll need more examples. Anyone who knows anything about startup investing, or scientific research for that matter, knows that a smart strategy needs lots of bets.

Government is famously less risk tolerant than (and at least as fickle as) private investors. So Mazzola, like the principal investigators leading dozens of other place-based industrial policy programs enacted in the last half-decade, has a tall order: Appease federal bureaucrats, local policymakers and a growing list of stakeholders while ensuring credible science leads to good-faith bets on the market.

Meanwhile, for Mazzola, all that hangs in the balance of his program that could be funded up to $160 million over years, is the future of energy.

‘People and place’

Any fair criticism of direct government funding of commercialized science, as opposed to basic research, typically starts from the idea that too many goals get heaped into the strategy to ensure political support.

FUEL, like its peers, has priorities that are economic, workforce, scientific and political.

One reason regions still covet these sorts of programs is they typically come with a satisfying reinforcement of a local identity. In FUEL’s case, its focus ensures Louisiana’s role in the future of energy — a foundational building block of modern life.

No question Louisiana already plays a major role. The state is a top five natural-gas producer in the United States, and top 15 for energy production overall — though little from renewables so far. It’s also a heavyweight in petrochemicals, as the group’s NSF application reinforced.

Wedged between the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, fully five of the top 15 American ports that handle the most cargo are in Louisiana, per 2023 data. Much of the value of that tonnage comes from shipping out an array of oil and gas products.

Louisiana’s argument is that it’s a crossroads, and a low-carbon economy must go through its state lines.

“This program is about people in place,” Mazzola told me. “The evidence is that targeted investments here connect innovators to entrepreneurs — and you see companies like Encore CO₂ form because the pieces are already nearby.”

Can energy’s past be part of the energy future?

Too many “ecosystem” initiatives announce a bootcamp and call it a day, argues FUEL’s workforce lead Lacy McManus. An existing workforce is helpful, but new energy forms will demand new skills.

“We go where there’s momentum and capital-stack our programs,” McManus said of piecing together existing programs to fill gaps. “We’re co-designing with employers from the jump.”

One example: a teacher professional-development intensive run through SOWELA Technical Community College that bakes carbon-management and entrepreneurship modules directly into rural classrooms. FUEL seeded it with $100,000, and oil and gas giant ExxonMobil expanded it after seeing generative outcomes.

Herein lies understandable skepticism. Can any leader from energy’s past really play a part in energy’s future?

This debate appears elsewhere: Can the “bridge fuel” of natural gas really be an “environmentally sustainable” way to power data centers in Pennsylvania? (Yes, if the transition isn’t allowed to be a stall tactic).

“We’re not standing still,” Michael Butler of ExxonMobil’s public and government told me of the obvious critique. Towering energy giants must be part of the transition, and so they’re building carbon capture and storage across the Gulf Coast — capturing CO₂ from hard-to-abate sites and storing it thousands of feet underground. “And we need a world-class Louisiana workforce to do it.”

The company points to a growing CCS pipeline and storage network stretching across Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

What to watch

FUEL has put numbers on the table: 60 companies, with 80% building wealth in Louisiana, and a path toward $2 billion in impact from carbon-management innovation.

Mazzola joked that he’s competing against energy-giant Texas, which is half-true. He wears a place-based economic developer’s hat, and so Louisiana is his top priority. But if he manages to reach his goals, the energy problems his coalition helps address ought to benefit the rest of us.

If the energy transition is going to be real, it won’t be invented along in a think tank conference room. It will be commercialized in the places that already move the molecules — on river corridors, near refineries and along pipeline rights-of-way — by people who can turn a lab breakthrough into a payroll line.

Louisiana’s brewpub-to-bench-to-startup story is a reminder: The future shows up locally first, or it doesn’t show up at all.

Mazzola is here for it. He told me: “I hope everyone else is watching.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/encore-co2-founders-FUEL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 08:59:41.071085

The H2Med alliance aims to invigorate the European Union’s hydrogen corridor by supporting the organizations and companies that aim to develop massive cooperative hydrogen projects in the EU. By adding the 40 new members, the total stakeholders in the alliance now sit at 49, with more on the way if the current trend continues.

The H2med Alliance has taken considerable steps to establish a cooperative relationship between its partners

Hydrogen was there at the beginning of the universe and remains the most abundant element in the known universe. For a very long time indeed, the nations of the world, in particular those with alternative energy generation ambitions, have sought to increase the attention paid to the hydrogen sector.

At an event in Germany’s capital city, Berlin, the stakeholders of the H2Med alliance revealed that it has added an astonishing 40 new members, which can only benefit the lofty ambitions of cooperative relationships in the most mature hydrogen corridor in the European Union.

The H2med Alliance was launched in December 2024 by the five promoters of the H2med Corridor, which include:

REN (Portugal)

Enagás (Spain)

NaTran and Teréga (France)

OGE (Germany)

Along with leading companies in the energy and technology sectors, the H2Med alliance aims to consolidate itself as a reference platform for the development of the H2Med corridor in the EU.

The Deputy Director-General for Energy of the European Commission, Mechthild Wörsdörfer, underscored the European Commission’s support for the priority “Energy Highways” presented by President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union address on September 10.

Institutional representatives emphasized the importance of cross-border cooperation

Gone are the days when countries were left to their own devices to develop innovative energy solutions to meet the rising power demands in their regions. Nowadays, the global community is fostering cooperation with several cross-border institutions and companies in the energy sector.

The meeting in Germany saw a vast number of government representatives in attendance, which underscores the cooperative narrative that the H2Med alliance is developing. Industry insiders emphasized the need to coordinate timelines to ensure the economic viability of projects in the hydrogen sector.

The European Union’s leadership released a statement underlining the role that hydrogen plays in the region.

“Renewable hydrogen is a crucial component of our strategy for a cost-effective clean energy transition and to get rid of Russian fossil fuels in some industrial processes. Clear rules and a reliable certification system are key for this emerging market to develop and establish itself in Europe.

Aging plants and optimism The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

That’s where Gov. Jeff Landry seemingly found himself last Sunday after new aerial drone video footage from photographer Eric McVicker revealed the sorry state of the cleanup at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Tangipahoa Parish – more than five weeks after the Aug. 22 explosion and fire.

The governor was so moved by what he saw on McVicker’s footage that he posted his own video from the Governor’s Mansion to express his dissatisfaction with remediation efforts.

“They’re not going fast enough,” he said about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led effort.

Landry said he arranged a call with EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason, Louisiana Environmental Quality Secretary Courtney Burdette and state Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.

This corporate turnaround, however, came at a steep cost for existing shareholders, who saw their investments nearly wiped out as creditors assumed control of the reorganized company. The development marks a pivotal moment for this pioneer in silicon carbide technology.

Shareholder Wipeout Paves Way for Financial Overhaul

A drastic financial restructuring has positioned Wolfspeed with a significantly stronger balance sheet. The company slashed its total debt burden by approximately 70%, eliminating some $4.6 billion in liabilities. Terms for the remaining debt were extended out to 2030, and the firm anticipates its annual interest expenses will drop by about 60%.

This financial reset delivered a devastating blow to equity holders. All previously outstanding common shares were cancelled entirely. In exchange, former shareholders received a minuscule allocation of new equity—roughly one new share for every 120 old shares they held. This equated to a harsh exchange ratio of just 0.008352 new shares per cancelled share. The majority stake in the newly formed entity was allocated to the former creditors. Trading in the old shares was suspended on September 29, with their formal delisting from the NYSE scheduled for October 10.

A Fresh Start for a Leading-Edge Technology Provider

Despite its financial collapse, Wolfspeed's underlying business remains focused on cutting-edge semiconductor materials. The company specializes in producing silicon carbide and gallium nitride chips, which are critical components for electric vehicles, 5G infrastructure, renewable energy systems, and artificial intelligence applications.

Chief Executive Officer Robert Feurle struck an optimistic tone, stating that ""Wolfspeed has now entered a new era."" The improved capital structure is expected to help the corporation meet rising demand in its core markets. The board of directors has also been strengthened with the addition of five new, experienced members.

Scaling Operations and the Upcoming Quarterly Test

Looking ahead, Wolfspeed is focusing on scaling its operations. This strategy includes the recent commercialization of its 200mm silicon carbide product portfolio and ramping up output at new manufacturing facilities. The John Palmour Manufacturing Center for Silicon Carbide in North Carolina is poised to play a central role in this expansion.

The first major test for the reborn company will arrive in early November with the release of its inaugural quarterly earnings report since completing the restructuring. This financial update will reveal whether the drastic financial overhaul has successfully set the company on a stable path to growth or if further challenges lie ahead.

What's the used car market been like? And and how does that compare to some of these newer vehicles on the market?

Well, one thing we know is that electric cars tend to depreciate very rapidly. So whenever you see analysis of the cost to own, factor in initial purchase price and depreciation. The good news for consumers is that if you're looking for an electric car, a used electric car will be an amazing bargain. Like they are really competitive in terms of pricing. But at the same time, you get lots of compelling features and you get lots of cool safety equipment. So it can work out for consumers if they're looking for a good used electric car.

And finally, for shoppers looking to buy or trade in, end of year is usually that time that we see the most deals, the more the most tax incentives. Is that still the case this time around or did that playbook change a bit with the expiration of these tax credits?

I I think there's a there's several things putting pressure on that. Of course, you're going to see a little bit of that. It's going to be model by model, not brand by brand. But the two things that we're seeing is the expiration of the incentives plus tariffs. All of those things could have the potential to make the 2026 cars more expensive so that you may be able to get a discount on the 2025, but that's probably it. Going forward, not every automaker can afford to absorb the tariffs as many are doing right now.

All right, Brian, a lot to think about as we head towards the end of the year. Appreciate it. Thanks so much.

The administration has suspended the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases effective Sept. 30 and rolled back a number of other EV policies. On top of that, new tariffs on imported vehicles and automotive parts have thrown uncertainty into the industry picture.

But here's a little good news for some investors: Ford Motor Company (F 3.52%) and General Motors (GM 1.20%) have figured out a mini-loophole to help extend the federal tax credit to customers in the fourth quarter.

What's going on?

Ford and GM are working smarter, not harder, to extend the $7,500 federal tax incentive on EVs in the U.S. to help mitigate what was expected to be a fairly large slump following the end of the credit.

The Detroit automakers are cleverly using their finance arms to offer the incentive beyond its Sept. 30 expiration date. The way this is achieved is for Ford and GM's finance arm to make down payments on the EVs even before finding customers wanting to lease the vehicles.

""If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before September 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after September 30, 2025.""

That's what the IRS guidance says, according to Automotive News, which confirmed the existence of these programs.

Essentially, these down payments will qualify the financing arms for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles, and from there, dealers can offer leases on those cars to retail customers per usual for several more months, with the subsidy factored into the lease rate.

These clever programs are aimed at mitigating the impact of the ending tax credit, which, to the surprise of many, has been in place for more than 15 years, trying to push EV adoption. Further, Ford confirmed to Reuters that it was working on its program to provide customers with competitive lease payments through Ford Credit until Dec. 31, effectively extending the federal $7,500 tax credit through leasing through the fourth quarter and pushing back some of the expected upcoming EV sales slump into 2026.

For those wondering if this will impact Tesla (TSLA -1.41%), the answer is unclear. Tesla does indeed have its own in-house finance arm, known as Tesla Finance LLC, but it's yet to be confirmed as of this writing if Tesla developed a similar program through its finance arm -- although, because the impact for Tesla is likely to be much larger than Ford or GM's EV divisions, it's a development for investors to watch for.

What it all means

EV sales have yet to gain the traction in the U.S. market once anticipated by automakers just a few years ago, and for the most part, they're still money losers. But the only way to make these vehicles profitable is to substantially increase scale, which the loss of the $7,500 tax credit works directly against.

In a way, this is the best of both worlds for Ford and GM. On one hand, it can still drive demand for its EVs during the fourth quarter, perhaps when competitors cannot, helping build more scale and delay the eventual slowdown of EVs in the post-tax-credit era. Meanwhile, as that continues to drive fourth-quarter EV demand, as consumers shift back slightly toward internal combustion engine options, the automakers stand to benefit from sales of much more profitable vehicles in the near-term.

At the end of the day, it's just a bit of pretty good news for Ford and GM for the fourth quarter.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835777/2024-silverado-ev-rst-020.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 05:58:56.665739

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company.
The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future.
""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts.","BILLINGS, Mont. -- U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse.

Trump rejected climate change as a ""con job"" during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as ""beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed.

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump's actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

""Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,"" Paliwal said.

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually -- up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody's projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. ""The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.""

Cambodia’s clean energy transition took center stage this week as policymakers, investors, and development partners gathered for Clean Energy Week 2025, organized by EnergyLab Cambodia. The event underscored both the vast opportunities and the sobering challenges in transforming the Kingdom’s energy system into one that is competitive, sustainable, and investment-ready.

A Vision for Smarter, Sustainable Growth

At the Clean Energy Summit, Hem Vanndy, Minister of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation, urged Cambodia’s industries to embrace renewable energy as the cornerstone of future growth.

“Clean energy is no longer an alternative; it is the imperative,” he said. “To remain competitive, Cambodia must embed clean energy into every factory, every supply chain, and every industrial policy.”

Vanndy said renewables such as solar, hydro, and wind can lower costs for manufacturers and make “Made in Cambodia” products more attractive to global brands increasingly demanding sustainability in their supply chains. Yet, he cautioned that the shift must go beyond rhetoric. “Our energy system must evolve from simply providing power to providing power smartly, sustainably, and strategically,” he added.

Backing from Partners, But Financing Challenges Persist

Australian Ambassador to Cambodia Derek Yip reaffirmed Australia’s long-term support through the Cambodia-Australia Partnership for Resilient Economic Development (CAPRED), highlighting new initiatives to improve renewable energy forecasting and grid management.

“We’re working closely with the Royal Government to strengthen the country’s capacity to integrate variable renewable energy,” Yip said. He also announced the Cambodia Climate Financing Facility, expected to unlock around $350 million for climate-friendly investments.

UNDP Resident Representative Enrico Gaveglia said Cambodia’s clean energy transition holds the key to achieving its sustainable development ambitions but warned of the capital intensity of the shift. “UNDP stands ready to support the Royal Government in mobilizing green finance and de-risking what is certainly a major transformation,” he said.

Investors Weigh Opportunities Against Practical Hurdles

EnergyLab Asia’s Regional Director, Natharoun Ngo Son, described Cambodia’s renewable drive as a “generational opportunity” to reshape its economic competitiveness and attract new capital. “Cambodia can show it’s ready to lead in the new clean energy paradigm,” he said.

Chhe Lidin, Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, highlighted significant progress, with 99 percent of villages and 95 percent of households now connected to electricity. “Renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives form the cornerstone of Cambodia’s energy policy,” he said.

However, analysts noted that scaling solar and wind capacity will require major investment in grid modernization and pricing reform to make renewable projects financially viable.

A Balancing Act Between Ambition and Execution

Under the theme “Unlocking a Clean Energy Economy,” Clean Energy Week 2025—organized by EnergyLab Cambodia in partnership with the Ministry of Mines and Energy, and co-founded by Australia and the United Nations Development Programme—runs until October 9.

The series of events aims to highlight how clean energy can drive Cambodia’s industrial and investment future while strengthening key sectors such as manufacturing and tourism.

While optimism ran high, many participants agreed that success will depend on aligning policy, finance, and technology to move from ambition to implementation.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the US to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

""We're not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we're not going to take risk,"" said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet ""delusional"" green power goals - a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt Battery energy storage systems that suck up chepower during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the US, California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That's enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100 per cent foolproof.

Advt

""This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,"" Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way ""to protect us until we know more,"" said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

""They're banking on nothing happening, but I don't think you can place it where they're proposing and assume nothing's going to happen,"" Sokolowski said. ""It's just too risky if it does.""

Aging plants and optimism The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

“The law firm is authorized to work for the Secretary of State’s office, but I haven’t done any work,” Litchfield said.
Murrill also fired Celia Cangelosi, who has been an outside counsel for the Secretary of State’s office for more than 25 years.
Cangelosi’s current contract calls for payments of $375 per hour, up to $400,000 per year from the Secretary of State’s office.
Murrill said the legal conflict with Nancy Landry is awkward since they’ve known each other for so long.","Attorney General Liz Murrill has fired all of the outside lawyers working for Secretary of State Nancy Landry in an extraordinary high-stakes legal battle between two of Louisiana’s six statewide elected officers.

Murrill said she acted to protect her primacy as Louisiana’s chief legal officer after Landry, in her view, challenged that authority in advance of an upcoming U.S. Supreme Court hearing on whether Louisiana will have to redraw its congressional voting maps.

Landry believes Murrill has overreacted and questions whether the attorney general has the right to end her outside legal contracts. She declined to answer when asked whether she might go to court to block Murrill.

Adding to the legal and political drama, Murrill and Landry, while not close friends, grew up a block from each other in the Greenbriar neighborhood of Lafayette and went to Lafayette High School, LSU and LSU law school at the same time. Landry is one year older.

At the heart of the dispute is the Callais case, which is sure to draw national attention because Louisiana is asking the Supreme Court to overturn the decades-old Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. If the court invalidates Section 2, the state Legislature is poised to redraw Louisiana’s congressional boundaries to force either U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields or U.S. Rep. Troy Carter or both — they are Black Democrats — out of Congress, to be replaced by a Republican.

In Murrill’s view, Landry has recently attempted to insert her views into Callais before the Supreme Court, and in so doing has tried to usurp Murrill’s role.

In her most recent brief, Landry wrote that she has consistently opposed the Legislature’s decision in January 2024 to create a second Black-majority congressional seat won later that year by Fields. The Legislature’s decision – which had the full support of Murrill and Gov. Jeff Landry, to the dismay of conservatives subsequently – is the central question in the Callais case.

Murrill and Jeff Landry said they supported creating the second Black-majority district because of recent Louisiana court rulings. Nancy Landry now says she favored keeping the previous congressional map, where Carter was the only Democrat.

“What Nancy is trying to do, for whatever reason, is to stake out some political position,” Murrill said in an interview. “Maybe she believes the court is on the verge of making some consequential decision on redistricting, she wants to stake out a new place, a different place than she had taken before publicly, and rewrite history.”

That’s nonsense, Landry said in a separate interview.

“My actions are not politically motivated at all,” she said.

The Callais case

At issue is Landry’s decision to file her own legal brief in August and support the position of the Callais plaintiffs seeking to overturn the current congressional map, which includes four Republicans and the two Black Democrats. Landry also asked the Supreme Court to add 10 minutes to oral arguments to allow her outside counsel, Phillip Strach with the Nelson Mullins law firm, to present her legal position. The court said no to that request.

Landry said she was simply trying to make sure that her point of view was represented through legal counsel when the Supreme Court handles the redistricting case. Oral arguments are scheduled for Oct. 15.

“The remedy in this case intimately involves my office,” said Landry, who oversees elections in Louisiana. She is named as a defendant.

Landry said her lawyers offered comments to the brief that Murrill’s lawyers were preparing. Murrill’s team didn’t respond, Landry said. That prompted her to file her own brief, she added.

“I have been consistent throughout the case in the pleadings,” Landry said. “There’s nothing unusual or different in the filing of this brief.”

For her part, Murrill said Landry didn’t show her brief to the attorney general’s office before filing it and then wouldn’t discuss the matter.

“For her to parachute in at the 11th hour and then demand to have her lawyers stand at the podium and then refuse to even tell me or the governor what she wanted to say was just unacceptable,” Murrill said. “She’s a ministerial officer, so her legal position on the constitutionality of the law is irrelevant. That’s my job, not her job.”

By ""ministerial officer,"" Murrill means Landry’s role is an administrative, not a policymaking one.

Contracts canceled

Murrill struck back at Landry by canceling Nelson Mullins’ contract to represent the Secretary of State’s office on redistricting — and then went a big step further by canceling Landry’s other seven outside legal contracts on other matters.

“If they don’t cooperate with the attorney general, then they won’t get my approval,” Murrill said. “So I disapproved them. I have indicated I have the resources to supply her with legal assistance. That is what I will do.”

In doing so, Murrill ended one contract the Secretary of State’s office had with Jimmy Faircloth, a friend and supporter who gave her first state government job when he was executive counsel to then-Gov. Bobby Jindal.

“It had nothing to do with the merits of the work,” Faircloth said of Murrill’s decision, adding that he hadn’t done any work on the Secretary of State contract for some time.

Murrill also canceled the Secretary of State’s contract with the Berrigan Litchfield law firm in New Orleans. John Litchfield served as Murrill’s campaign chair when she was elected as attorney general in 2023.

“The law firm is authorized to work for the Secretary of State’s office, but I haven’t done any work,” Litchfield said.

Murrill also fired Celia Cangelosi, who has been an outside counsel for the Secretary of State’s office for more than 25 years. Cangelosi’s current contract calls for payments of $375 per hour, up to $400,000 per year from the Secretary of State’s office. Cangelosi did not return a phone call.

The top Nelson Mullins lawyers earn $475 per hour, up to $800,000 per year in payments. Strach did not respond to an email.

Besides the one with Nelson Mullins, Murrill said she severed the other outside legal contracts to ensure that Landry doesn’t try to put any of those lawyers on the redistricting case.

Murrill said her office and the governor’s office have to approve legal contracts for all state agencies.

Jay Dardenne, who served in various capacities of state government for more than 30 years, said attorneys general have sometimes refused to hire lawyers sought by the governor – a dispute between then-Gov. John Bel Edwards and then-Attorney General Jeff Landry ended up in court, with Landry winning and Edwards not getting the lawyers he wanted in a coastal lawsuits case.

But Dardenne could not remember an instance where the attorney general’s office simply canceled existing contracts.

Murrill said the legal conflict with Nancy Landry is awkward since they’ve known each other for so long.

“It’s not my preferred outcome,” Murrill said. “But I got to do what I got to do. Of course, I still consider her a friend.”

Landry said she and Murrill haven’t talked in over a month.

“Part of working with Liz is working through disagreements,” Landry said. “I’m just surprised that it’s become this involved with the firing of every attorney of the Secretary of State’s office employs over what I consider to be a very minor disagreement.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c6/8c64f12c-63bf-11ef-b8b4-4724aa5ee2d9/65d3c8675358b.image.jpg?crop=1751%2C919%2C0%2C132&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-05 05:59:06.158406

This boom is largely credited to the government’s Electric Car Grant, reintroduced in July 2025, which offers buyers up to £3,750 off the price of 36 electric car models.
“Our discounts have sparked a surge in electric car sales, making them cheaper and within reach of more households than ever before,” said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, as quoted by Carwow.
While gasoline models, especially the traditional Escalade, remain popular, Cadillac’s electric vehicle sales have increased 88% year-to-date compared to 2024.
For now, though, the road ahead for electric vehicles looks busier—and brighter—than ever.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer just a futuristic dream—they’re rapidly becoming a fixture on roads in the UK and the United States, breaking sales records and reshaping the auto industry. In September 2025, the UK saw a remarkable surge, with over 72,000 new electric vehicles registered, accounting for 23.3% of all new car sales, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) alone soared by 29% compared to the previous year, marking the best month ever for BEVs in the UK. When hybrids are included, electrified vehicles made up more than half of all new registrations, helping the UK car market achieve its strongest September since 2020 (as reported by Jang and Tech Digest).

This boom is largely credited to the government’s Electric Car Grant, reintroduced in July 2025, which offers buyers up to £3,750 off the price of 36 electric car models. Over 20,000 people have already claimed the discount, drawing from a £650 million funding pool. The grant’s impact has been immediate and dramatic. “Our discounts have sparked a surge in electric car sales, making them cheaper and within reach of more households than ever before,” said Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, as quoted by Carwow. She added, “By cutting costs for families we’re supporting industry, backing British jobs, and powering up growth.”

The grant is not just making new EVs more accessible—used electric car prices have dropped by over 20% since last year, and the price gap between new petrol and electric cars has narrowed by 14%, now averaging £8,229. EV drivers can also save up to £1,500 a year on fuel and running costs compared to petrol cars, according to government figures cited by Carwow.

Industry leaders are quick to point out that this is not just a flash in the pan. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, emphasized, “Electrified vehicles are powering market growth after a sluggish summer—and with record ZEV [zero emission vehicle] uptake, massive industry investment is paying off, despite demand still trailing ambition.” John Veichmanis, CEO of Carwow, noted, “Since the scheme launched, EV enquiries on our platform have doubled. The grant is transforming curiosity into action, encouraging drivers to try an electric car for the first time—and once they do, most never look back.”

The government’s ambitions are clear: zero-emission vehicles are targeted to make up 28% of new car sales by the end of 2025. While the pure electric share is still a bit shy of that goal, industry analysts say that with various “flexibilities” built into the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, sales are generally ahead of where they need to be (Tech Digest).

Of course, incentives alone aren’t enough. The UK is also investing heavily in charging infrastructure, with over 85,000 public charging points across Britain and one being added every half hour. A further 100,000 are planned, backed by a £381 million local infrastructure fund. An additional £63 million is earmarked for innovative charging solutions, including pavement-to-home connections, which could allow some drivers to run their EVs for as little as 2p per mile.

But the grant isn’t without its limitations. It currently applies to about a quarter of BEVs due to price caps and manufacturing emission rules, which effectively block many Chinese brands. Nevertheless, the ever-increasing variety of eligible models—37 at present, including Ford, Nissan, Vauxhall, and Citroen—has helped drive demand, with some models seeing a 118% spike in enquiries.

The electric revolution is not limited to the UK. Across the Atlantic, Cadillac achieved a historic milestone in the third quarter of 2025, with electric vehicles accounting for nearly 40% of its new car sales in the US—a staggering 154% increase compared to the same period last year, according to UNN and InsideEVs. This surge was fueled by a now-expired federal incentive of $7,500, prompting buyers to rush dealerships before the benefit ended.

General Motors’ luxury division was well prepared, with its lineup ready to meet the demand. In just three months, Cadillac sold 18,383 electric vehicles, including 7,309 units of the Lyriq, 4,886 of the compact Optiq, 3,924 of the three-row Vistiq, and 2,264 of the Escalade IQ EV. The Optiq’s performance was particularly notable, achieving almost half of its annual sales in a single quarter. The Vistiq, resembling a smaller Escalade, accounted for 70% of its annual volume in just three months. While gasoline models, especially the traditional Escalade, remain popular, Cadillac’s electric vehicle sales have increased 88% year-to-date compared to 2024. The third quarter of 2025 was Cadillac’s best third-quarter and best full-year performance since 2013.

“Thanks to the tax credit and buyers’ fear of missing out on the benefit, GM’s luxury car division sold two out of every five new cars as electric vehicles, making this quarter the most successful in the brand’s history in the EV market,” reported UNN.

The UK and US stories offer both parallels and contrasts. In both countries, government incentives have proven to be powerful catalysts, giving hesitant buyers the final push to make the switch to electric. The results are clear: record-breaking sales, an expanding array of models, and a growing infrastructure network. Yet challenges remain. In the UK, the Electric Car Grant’s restrictive eligibility and the need for more private buyers to join the movement are ongoing concerns. Mike Hawes of the SMMT stressed, “The Electric Car Grant will help to break down one of the barriers holding back more drivers from making the switch—and tackling remaining roadblocks, by unlocking infrastructure investment and driving down energy costs, will be crucial to the success of the industry and the environmental goals we share.”

There’s also speculation that the intense demand for the UK grant could lead to the scheme closing earlier than planned, raising questions about what will sustain momentum once incentives run out. Meanwhile, in the US, Cadillac’s electric surge was tied directly to a temporary federal incentive. Now that the $7,500 tax credit has expired, the sustainability of such high EV sales is uncertain, especially in the face of broader economic and industry challenges.

What’s not in doubt is the direction of travel. With governments setting ambitious targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles—like the UK’s 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales—and automakers pouring billions into electrification, the electric car transition is accelerating. The coming years will test whether this momentum can be maintained as incentives wane and infrastructure is put to the test. For now, though, the road ahead for electric vehicles looks busier—and brighter—than ever.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/p5bo1JDiDsYPkJwpT9ncCxbvm0U=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F0dc70bec-36b7-41f3-8dcc-4f90f931789f.jpeg,N,,2025-10-05 12:02:15.775632

America united around splitting atoms In the US, the embrace of nuclear energy has been bipartisan.
And this summer, the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan became the first decommissioned US nuclear power plant to return to operational status, financed in part by a $1.5 billion loan from the Department of Energy.
The UK plans to increase its nuclear capacity to meet 25% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from 15% currently.
And Russia is working on 19 nuclear power plants beyond its borders in places like Turkey, Iran, and Bangladesh, making it the biggest exporter of nuclear capacity.","Just like the dusty vinyl records your parents were on the verge of tossing for years, nuclear power is undergoing a renaissance.

For decades, the energy source fell out of favor due to safety concerns and high plant construction costs; its share of the world’s electricity supply plummeted to 9% in 2024 from 17% in 1996, according to the global energy think tank Ember.

But in recent years, amid advances in safety and experimental tech promising greater affordability, many countries have begun to view nuclear power generation as a source of scalable low-carbon energy. Meanwhile, tech giants have started bankrolling reactors to power the AI boom.

America united around splitting atoms

In the US, the embrace of nuclear energy has been bipartisan. During the Biden administration, Congress passed subsidies to incentivize the deployment of nuclear energy. And in his second term, President Trump issued executive orders aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles for new reactors, with the stated aim of quadrupling capacity by 2050.

Over a dozen reactors have been closed in the US since 2012, and no new large-scale nuclear power plants are getting built—yet. But as anticipated next-gen reactors undergo regulatory review, several older decommissioned ones are getting de-mothballed:

A decommissioned reactor at Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear disaster in American history, is due to go back online (it wasn’t involved in the 1979 accident). The reactor’s owner, Constellation Energy, signed a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Microsoft last year.

And this summer, the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan became the first decommissioned US nuclear power plant to return to operational status, financed in part by a $1.5 billion loan from the Department of Energy.

The world powers ahead

Despite the renewed enthusiasm in the US, the vast majority of new capacity is coming online in other countries.

China, which lacks fossil fuel reserves, has added 80% of the world’s new nuclear capacity in the past five years and is due to surpass the US in total nuclear power generation, according to the International Energy Agency.

Meanwhile, the EU gave nuclear power a boost when it recognized it as a clean energy source, making it eligible for government subsidies. France currently plans to build six new nuclear reactors.

The UK plans to increase its nuclear capacity to meet 25% of its electricity needs by 2050, up from 15% currently. And Russia is working on 19 nuclear power plants beyond its borders in places like Turkey, Iran, and Bangladesh, making it the biggest exporter of nuclear capacity.",https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2025-10-03/image-e03047069db278dce2007d49063bd0c18087db7c-5280x3624-jpg/GettyImages-2177851466.webp,N,,2025-10-05 03:58:11.672423

The strategy aligns with the directives set out in the 13th National Party Congress. Complementary legislation, including revisions to the Land Law and Water Resources Law, has been introduced to reinforce environmental governance and sustainable resource management.

Vietnam has also rolled out targeted policies such as the Hydrogen Energy Development Strategy to 2030, and initiatives promoting sustainable cultivation of one million hectares of high-quality, low-emission rice. The Government is mobilising significant resources to tackle climate change in vulnerable regions, notably the Mekong Delta, with 16 major projects receiving approximately 2.5 billion USD in funding.

Financial institutions have been mobilised to support the green transition. Green credit in Vietnamese banks has grown at an annual rate of 20% since 2017, accounting for nearly 4.5% of the nation’s total outstanding loans in 2023. Between 2019 and 2023, Vietnam issued green bonds worth around 1.16 billion USD. In a landmark move, the country successfully sold 10.3 million carbon credits through the World Bank in 2023, raising 51.5 million USD.

Despite these strides, experts note significant obstacles remain. Regulatory frameworks specifically designed to promote green economy practices remain underdeveloped, often limited to high-level policy directions rather than detailed, actionable laws. There is a need to enhance public awareness and commitment to environmental stewardship.

Moreover, financing gaps persist, and much of Vietnam’s production technology remains outdated and energy-intensive, resulting in low productivity and inefficient waste treatment. Renewable energy sectors such as wind and solar power, while growing, have yet to reach the scale necessary to meet national demand.

Deputy Minister of Finance Nguyen Thi Bich Ngoc highlighted ongoing efforts to refine the legal and institutional frameworks supporting ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. She emphasised that these frameworks are critical to guiding investment decisions, resource allocation, and facilitating access to green finance both domestically and internationally.

Professor Dr Nguyen Dinh Tho, Director of the Institute of Strategy and Policy on Natural Resources and Environment, stressed the importance of green transformation across economic sectors. He advocated for embracing circular economy models to optimise resource efficiency toward conservation, underpinned by science, technology, and digital innovation, alongside sustainable infrastructure development.

At the 4th P4G Summit held in Vietnam in April 2025, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh outlined three key proposals for global cooperation on green growth. These include fostering green mindsets to drive innovation and digital transformation, building responsible green communities where governments provide stable frameworks and the private sector leads technology investment, and enhancing international partnerships, particularly public-private partnerships, to eliminate institutional barriers and accelerate flows of green capital and technology.

Investment continues to surge, exceeding US$2 trillion per year, with renewable energy's share in global electricity generation expected to double to 25% by 2030. Long-term (2025-2030 and beyond), renewables are expected to generate nearly 50% of global electricity by 2030, and global energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to peak by 2025. Strategic pivots involve balancing hydrocarbon returns with the pace of transition, investing in technological innovation like carbon capture and green hydrogen, and adapting to evolving grid infrastructure. Significant opportunities exist in grid modernization, corporate commitments to 100% renewable energy, and the decarbonization of heavy industry. However, challenges include geopolitical tensions, particularly China's dominance in the clean tech supply chain, high upfront costs for renewable projects, insufficient grid and storage infrastructure, and the immense energy demands of AI data centers.

Biotechnology, with a global market estimated at $1.744 trillion in 2025, is projected to surge to over $5 trillion by 2034. In the short term (2025-2026), advancements in AI and digital transformation will accelerate drug discovery and clinical trials, with significant growth expected in oncology, rare diseases, and metabolic therapies. Long-term (2025-2030 and beyond), biotechnology holds the promise of curing or eradicating many common diseases within the next two decades, driven by advances in gene therapy, regenerative medicine, and personalized medicine. Strategic pivots will involve focusing on high-potential sub-sectors, diversifying funding models beyond traditional equity, and investing in adjacent areas like diagnostics and digital health platforms. The looming ""patent cliff"" (over $300 billion in sales at risk through 2030) will drive pipeline diversification and strategic acquisitions. Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory landscapes, high R&D costs, ethical and biosecurity concerns, and a shortage of skilled talent. Cybersecurity threats against sensitive biotech data are also a growing concern.

The overarching theme for all three sectors is one of rapid evolution and adaptation.

“The market’s established, and we’re probably ready to have a market that can … grow without subsidies,” he said.
He bolstered his case by highlighting the explosion of consumer choice, with 65 different EV models now available in the American market.
The bear case: an industry ‘cut in half’ On the other side of the argument is the powerful and influential CEO of Ford, Jim Farley.
“Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle.","A high-stakes and deeply divided debate has erupted at the highest levels of the auto industry, as two of its most influential figures offer starkly opposing visions for the future of the electric vehicle market in a world without subsidies.

The fierce war of words, sparked by the recent death of the $7,500 federal tax credit, pits the bullish optimism of a former Tesla executive against the dire warnings of Ford’s CEO, a clash of perspectives that will have profound implications for the future of American transportation.

The bull case: ‘the market’s established’

On one side of the divide is Jon McNeill, a former Tesla president of global sales and a current GM board member.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he projected a calm confidence, arguing that the US electric vehicle market is now mature enough to stand on its own two feet.

He pointed to Europe as a powerful case study, noting that when countries like Germany rolled back their own subsidies a few years ago, the EV market “surprisingly … continued to grow.”

McNeill believes the US is poised for a similar outcome. “The market’s established, and we’re probably ready to have a market that can … grow without subsidies,” he said.

He bolstered his case by highlighting the explosion of consumer choice, with 65 different EV models now available in the American market. When combined with hybrids, he noted, one out of every four cars sold in the US is now electrified.

The bear case: an industry ‘cut in half’

On the other side of the argument is the powerful and influential CEO of Ford, Jim Farley.

Speaking at a summit in Detroit, he took a virtually opposite and far more pessimistic tack, predicting that the death of the $7,500 consumer incentive is a “game-changer” that will cut the EV industry in half.

While he believes EVs will remain a “vibrant industry,” he also stated it’s “going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,” projecting a steep drop in EV market share from its current 10 to 12 percent down to just 5 percent.

“The customers are pesky,” Farley said, delivering a blunt and sobering dose of reality.

“Customers are not interested in a $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast. They’re efficient. You don’t go to the gas station. But they’re expensive.”

The X-Factor: a car that powers your house

But there is another, powerful X-factor in this debate, a technological evolution that could fundamentally reshape the value proposition of owning an EV: the car that can power your house.

McNeill argued that the emerging trend of “bidirectional” charging, which allows an EV to push energy back into the grid or directly into a home, will be a powerful driver of future growth.

He shared a personal example, stating that his Silverado EV can power his entire house for two weeks, completely eliminating the need for a separate, noisy generator.

He revealed that his local utility has already offered him a “big break on my utility bills” in exchange for access to just 20 percent of his vehicle’s battery.

On this point, Farley actually agreed, seeing a bright future for “partial electrification.” “We think hybrid, EV plug-in, E-revs, those kind of partial electric solutions, America is going to fall in love with, or already is falling in love with,” he said.

While the two titans may disagree on the immediate future, they both see a world where the line between a vehicle and a home power plant is beginning to blur, a technological shift that could prove to be the most powerful incentive of all.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-10-05 05:59:00.774836

As tax credits wind down, Lore says there may be an unexpected silver lining.","Federal tax credits for electric vehicles are expiring Tuesday night, after a Republican tax and spending bill eliminated them several years earlier than they were originally set to end.

For Jesse Lore, the owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, N.H., that means September has been busy. On Monday night, with a little over 24 hours left until the tax credit deadline, he was juggling several customers.

“It’s crazy, and the phone doesn’t stop ringing, but that’s a good thing,” he said. “Make hay while the sun is shining.”

Until Tuesday night, EV buyers could get a tax credit for $4,000 on a used car and $7,500 on a new car. As those credits drew closer to expiring, electric car sales accelerated across the country.

Lore says his business has seen about a 70% increase in September sales over last year. But come Wednesday, all the cars on his lot under $25,000 — the maximum price for the used EV tax credit — will get more expensive. And lots of people bought cars ahead of the deadline. Lore expects the combination of those factors to pump the breaks on his sales.

Green Wave, like other dealers, offered the tax credits as “cash on the hood,” selling cars for a discounted price and then getting reimbursed by the federal government. But in recent weeks, Lore says those payments have been stalled.

“We’re still out well over $100,000 in terms of cash that we have not been paid on. And that’s a lot for a small business,” he said.

Lore said his team discussed whether to stop offering the credit and ask their customers to file for it themselves. But ultimately, they decided to keep selling cars for the discount until the deadline.

“We believe that the law is clear. We believe that we will get paid,” he said.

As tax credits wind down, Lore says there may be an unexpected silver lining. Traditional dealerships may buy fewer electric vehicles, causing wholesale prices to drop.

“There’s a lot of fierce competition in the marketplace for car sales,” he said. “As wholesale prices go down, so too will retail prices.”

Lore says that price drop won’t make up for the loss of the credits, but could help consumers a little. And, he said, he’s hoping decreases in development costs and batteries will drive the cost of electric cars below gas cars over the next decade.

“That’s coming up,” he said. “But today it’s not necessarily there.”

Incumbent Carrboro Mayor Barbara Foushee, Carrboro Mayor Pro Tem Danny Nowell, Carrboro Town Council member Cristóbal Palmerand former Carrboro poet laureate Fred Joiner were present.

Executive director of the Community Empowerment Fund Donna Carrington moderated the forum.

Housing Access and Affordability

Carrington began by asking Joiner, the only non-incumbent candidate, what the Town is doing well to promote housing access and affordability, and what he would change if elected.

Joiner said he is still learning about the Town's processes and thinks streamlining engagement with developers would increase accessibility.

Carrington asked incumbent candidates on how their understanding of the Town’s affordable housing needs has changed since they have been in office, and how they would address those needs in their next term.

Nowell said the Town must focus aggressively on increasing affordable housing units through gap financing projects and innovative loan structures.

“Right now, we are in a crisis. We have fallen so far behind that it is not just a need to add housing — it is an emergency,” Palmer said.

Palmer also said the intersection between Town policies must be utilized to increase housing access and affordability.

Foushee said the Town did well in adding another half-cent to the property tax rate to be invested in affordable housing this past budget cycle. She said she looks forward to the Town’s new Unified Development Ordinance and collaborations with other municipalities.

Homelessness

Carrington asked candidates how they would address the needs of Carrboro’s unhoused population.

Foushee said she doesn’t want poverty or homelessness to be criminalized, but approached collaboratively by those impacted, business owners and organizations.

Palmer said he agreed with Foushee about preventing criminalization, and a disconnect exists between elected officials and those working with the chronically unhoused.

Nowell said the Town must use strategies like revolving loan funds to induce developers to create more affordable units.

Joiner said creative solutions are essential to ensuring housing for those who don’t meet area median income requirements but remain in need.

Response to Funding Cuts

Carrington asked candidates how they planned to build infrastructure support as federal and state financial resources are shifted away from the community.

Carrboro’s budgetary structure, which relies heavily on property taxes, makes the Town somewhat less vulnerable than other communities, Nowell said.

Nowell said he is looking to make the design process for infrastructure projects more efficient to increase the Town’s competitiveness.

Joiner said the community must strengthen mutual aid bonds to protect itself against funding losses.

Palmer said he believes in normalizing conversations around salary to better support those most vulnerable to the effects of cuts.

Foushee said appropriate action will be gauged as Carrboro recovers from Tropical Storm Chantal, which later downgraded to a depression, and that federal and state funding is becoming less reliable.

""I feel like, more and more, we can't rely on that much,"" Foushee said.

Transportation

Candidates were asked which active transportation projects they would prioritize in office and why. They were also asked about any projects they would like to introduce if elected.

Palmer said adding an East-West corridor connection to the North-South Bus Rapid Transit project would be ideal. He also said the most recent budget had effectively greenlit many impactful projects.

Joiner said he would like to expand sensibly on strategies to reduce the Town’s usage of cars.

Foushee said she is excited for the building of a sidewalk on South Greensboro Street and the implementation of the Vision Zero strategy, especially its Safe Routes to School traffic safety program. She wants investment in the expansion of public transit services for more frequent service, she said.

Nowell said community members should act on existing plans from the Town website’s project lists in collaboration with local organizations to target priority areas.

Climate Resilience

As a final question, Carrington asked candidates about making Carrboro more climate resilient.

Foushee said educating the community is key to safety during disasters.

Palmer said community members should consider Community Emergency Response Team training and involvement with the Green Neighborhoods Grant Program.

Nowell said actions to increase climate resiliency should incorporate mutual aid strategies. He also said that the Town should decrease dependency on cars.

""We will not have a climate resilient community or a climate resilient world if we are dependent on cars,"" Nowell said.

Joiner said climate resilience must be built into the community through infrastructure and housing choices.

A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with a skeletal staff and limited funding.

In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.

Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead ""the worst polluters"" to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.

""Nobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,"" said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.

""This administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,"" Symons said. ""Whittling away at EPA's ability to do its job.""

A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they ""significantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough."" Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.

The birth of EPA

The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an ""environmental ethic"" in his first speech.

""Each of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,"" Ruckelshaus said. ""Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.""

In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it has also added fighting climate change to its charge.

The EPA's job is essentially setting standards for what's healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done, and then acting as Earth's police officer if it isn't.

""Protecting human health and the environment is critical to the country's overall well-being,"" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. ""Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.""

But priorities change with presidential administrations.

Earlier this year, Trump's new EPA chief Lee Zeldin unveiled five pillars for the agency. The first is to ensure clean air, land and water. Right behind it is to ""restore American energy dominance,"" followed by environmental permitting reform, making the U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.

Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the ""endangerment"" finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.

Agency's shutdown plan

The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and other sources.

EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut — former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% — but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year, and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.

The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won't issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.

Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.

""Communities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,"" Boom said.

He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. ""So if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,"" he said.

""The quality of water coming out of your tap is directly tied to whether EPA is doing its job,"" said Jeanne Briskin, a former 40-year EPA employee who once headed the children's health protection division.

Nationally, food waste accounts for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the total food supply, equivalent to about 120 billion pounds annually.
Wasted food represents lost dollars, but it also contributes to methane emissions in landfills and strains waste management systems.
The financial waste embedded in America’s food habits is so vast that even modest reductions could have significant effects.
As inflation continues to stretch budgets and supply chains remain under pressure, tackling food waste represents one of the clearest opportunities to reclaim lost value in the U.S. economy.","Every year, Americans discard an astonishing amount of edible food, and the financial fallout is massive. From the latest financial study in 2023 alone, the United States generated an estimated 73.9 million tons of surplus food—food that was grown, processed, and purchased but never eaten. The overwhelming majority of that surplus ultimately became waste. Economists estimate the direct value of that discarded food at roughly $338 billion, a figure that ripples across households, businesses, and supply chains.

For the average consumer, this waste is far more than an abstract statistic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency calculates that each person effectively pays about $728 annually for food that ends up in the trash. For a typical household of four, that amounts to nearly $3,000 each year—money spent on groceries, restaurant meals, and take-out that provides no nourishment and no return. Much of this loss comes down to everyday behavior: overbuying at the grocery store, cooking more than is consumed, poor storage practices, and a widespread misunderstanding of date labels on packaging.

Expiration dates are a particularly costly culprit. Outside of infant formula, date labels in the United States are not federally regulated safety indicators. Most “sell by,” “best if used by,” and “use by” dates are suggestions for peak quality, not hard cutoffs for edibility. Yet consumers frequently treat these dates as expiration notices and throw out perfectly good food. This single misunderstanding sends billions of dollars’ worth of edible products into the garbage each year. It is a preventable form of loss that requires no new technology or infrastructure—only clear communication and more informed household decision-making.

The economic consequences extend far beyond family budgets. For retailers and restaurants, wasted food means thinner profit margins. Overstocking shelves, serving oversized portions, and poor demand forecasting lead to unsold inventory that must be hauled away at a cost. Farms and food processors face their own economic losses when perfectly good crops are left unharvested due to cosmetic standards, labor shortages, or volatile market conditions. Across the entire food system, this inefficiency represents squandered land, water, energy, and labor—resources that have already been paid for but ultimately generate no economic value.

Nationally, food waste accounts for roughly 30 to 40 percent of the total food supply, equivalent to about 120 billion pounds annually. While the numbers have stabilized somewhat since pandemic-era disruptions, 2023’s totals returned to pre-2020 levels, showing how persistent the issue remains. Retail sectors have made modest gains through improved inventory management, but plate waste and spoilage at the consumer level continue to dominate the problem.

The implications are both economic and environmental. Wasted food represents lost dollars, but it also contributes to methane emissions in landfills and strains waste management systems. Reducing waste offers a rare dual benefit: returning billions to household budgets and business balance sheets while lowering environmental impact without requiring large-scale new spending.

The financial waste embedded in America’s food habits is so vast that even modest reductions could have significant effects. Small changes in household behavior—more accurate meal planning, proper food storage, and a better understanding of labels—can collectively translate into billions of dollars saved each year. As inflation continues to stretch budgets and supply chains remain under pressure, tackling food waste represents one of the clearest opportunities to reclaim lost value in the U.S. economy.",https://www.grantspasstribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-waste.png,N,,2025-10-04 23:57:51.880899

“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Governor Moore said at the dam site.
An initial 2018 water quality certification and subsequent 2019 settlement were vacated by an appeals court in 2022, prompting a year of mediation that led to the new deal.
“This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” he said.
The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and a companion settlement agreement.","ANNAPOLIS, MD—Maryland Governor Wes Moore this week announced a “historic agreement” with Constellation Energy valued at more than $340 million, aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of the Conowingo Dam and bolstering Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts.

The commitments, negotiated in partnership with Waterkeepers Chesapeake and the Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, are intended to meet water quality standards and clear the way for the re-licensing and continued operation of the hydroelectric facility on the Susquehanna River.

“The Chesapeake Bay is the keystone to Maryland’s prosperity,” Governor Moore said at the dam site. “This agreement will lead to real improvements in water quality in the biggest tributary of the Chesapeake Bay, while securing the future of one of our state’s largest clean energy producers.”

Comprehensive Environmental Investment

The $340 million commitment includes operational improvements and both upfront and ongoing annual payments, distributed across several key environmental initiatives over the dam’s license term:

Water Quality and Resiliency: $87.6 million for pollution reduction efforts, including shoreline restoration, forest buffers, and planting underwater grasses.

Trash and Debris Removal: $77.8 million to strengthen efforts to clear debris, which currently averages about 600 tons annually.

Aquatic Life Passage: More than $28 million for fish and eel passage improvements, aimed at helping American shad, river herring, and freshwater mussels rebound.

Freshwater Mussel Restoration: $23.3 million to build and operate a hatchery to seed the river with mussels, which act as natural water filters.

Dredging Studies: $18.7 million to support additional studies on dredging the dam’s reservoir.

The agreement resolves a long-standing legal challenge regarding the dam’s environmental impacts. An initial 2018 water quality certification and subsequent 2019 settlement were vacated by an appeals court in 2022, prompting a year of mediation that led to the new deal.

Economic and Clean Energy Impact

Constellation Energy’s President and CEO, Joe Dominguez, noted that the agreement supports the dam’s role as the state’s largest source of renewable energy.

“The Susquehanna watershed is home to one of the largest concentrations of clean energy generation in America, and Constellation is proud to build on that nearly century-old legacy,” Dominguez said.

State officials highlighted the economic benefits of a cleaner Bay, which underpins a $3.2 billion annual tourism economy and a seafood industry contributing nearly $600 million to the state each year.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony G. Brown praised the collaborative effort. “This historic agreement ensures that our children and grandchildren will inherit a Chesapeake Bay and Susquehanna River that are cleaner and healthier than they are today,” he said.

The commitments are contained in a Revised Water Quality Certification issued by the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) and a companion settlement agreement. MDE Secretary Serena McIlwain confirmed that all parties, including the environmental groups who had challenged the previous framework, have signed on.

— Geoffrey Chan

HONG KONG, HONG KONG, October 4, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- RadiansPlus Technologies, a pioneer in sustainable grid innovation, today announced the launch of PSN-DLM (Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management), a groundbreaking technology that redefines how electric vehicle (EV) charging and distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems interact with existing grid infrastructure.

As cities worldwide race toward net-zero targets, grid capacity constraints have emerged as a critical barrier to scaling EV charging and solar adoption—especially in high-density urban environments. Traditional approaches rely on expensive, time-consuming grid upgrades or battery energy storage systems (BESS), often passing significant costs onto consumers or taxpayers while generating additional embodied carbon during construction.

Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management (PSN-DLM) changes the game. Built on RadiansPlus’ patented Power System Neutral (PSN) architecture, PSN-DLM intelligently orchestrates real-time energy demand and supply by differentiating between power (instantaneous load) and energy (total consumption over time). The system dynamically manages flexible loads—such as EV charging—and modulates solar export to align with available grid capacity, ensuring seamless integration without overloading substations or feeders.

Key Benefits of Power System Neutral – Dynamic Load Management:

• Zero Grid Expansion Required: Enables full utilization of existing grid assets, deferring or eliminating the need for costly upgrades.

• 80%+ Cost Savings: Compared to conventional grid reinforcement or BESS deployment.

• Equitable Access: Makes EV charging and solar energy accessible in underserved communities, public housing, and dense urban zones.

• Grid-Friendly Integration: Real-time coordination between EVs, PV systems, and grid constraints ensures stability and maximizes renewable utilization.

• Rapid Deployment: Short certification and installation timelines accelerate time-to-value for charge point operators (CPOs), building owners, and utilities.

“PSN-DLM delivers the ‘friendly handshake’ the energy transition desperately needs—between EVs, solar panels, and the grid,” said Geoffrey Chan, Co-Founder & Technical Director of RadiansPlus Technologies. “By harnessing flexibility on both the demand and supply sides, we unlock the full potential of existing infrastructure, making decarbonization faster, fairer, and more affordable.”

The technology has already been validated across multiple pilot sites in Asia, including public housing estates in Hong Kong and Singapore, commercial hubs like VivoCity Mall, and transportation infrastructure managed by airport authorities. These deployments demonstrate grid utilization improvements of up to 90% and the ability to support EV charging loads up to 200% of original substation capacity—without hardware upgrades.

PSN-DLM is part of RadiansPlus’ integrated “Solution in a Box” offering, compatible with OCPP standards and is preparing for a future where it is ready for integration with BESS and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) networks. The company is actively engaging with utilities, regulators, CPOs, and real estate developers to scale deployment across Asia and beyond.

Energy experts from different sectors gathered during the Clean Energy Week 2025 on October 3 to discuss Energy Efficiency (EE) significance, implementation issues and further prospects.
According to Mahfuzur Rahman, senior analyst at the Global Green Growth Institute Cambodia (GGGI), energy efficiency in the building sector is crucial due to its high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the sector accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the energy demand and emissions in Cambodia.
“The need for green and low-carbon building concepts is essential to contribute to the economy and meet national energy efficiency targets,” he said.
“If you look at the national energy efficiency policy, you see a long list of works or work plans,” Mola said.","PHNOM PENH — Cambodia has experienced dramatic economic growth in recent decades, fueled by energy-intensive industries and rapid urbanization. But experts warn that without energy-efficient practices in factories, businesses and buildings, the country risks unnecessary energy waste.

Cambodia aims to reduce energy consumption by at least 19 percent by 2030 according to its 2022-2030 National Energy Efficiency Policy, as the country sees the advantage of using lower energy for similar or better performance to reap the economic benefits.

According to Mahfuzur Rahman, senior analyst at the Global Green Growth Institute Cambodia (GGGI), energy efficiency in the building sector is crucial due to its high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the sector accounting for 30 to 35 percent of the energy demand and emissions in Cambodia.

“The need for green and low-carbon building concepts is essential to contribute to the economy and meet national energy efficiency targets,” he said.

Rey Sopheak, national expert at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), said that energy efficiency is essential for industrial parks to save costs and improve competitiveness, adding that industrial parks need to address both energy and water consumption to ensure sustainability.

“The concept of agro-industrial parks can help integrate different industries and create value from waste,” he said. “Collaboration between different factories in an industrial park can create a stronger voice for energy efficiency improvements.”

The industrial sector's energy demand in Cambodia has notably increased, going from 8,850 GWh in 2010 to 20,411 GWh in 2019, reflecting heightened industrial activities and energy requirements. The national policy aims for a 20 percent reduction in thermal and electrical energy consumption in the Industrial Sector by 2030, targeting approximately 30,000 GWh, which would represent a saving of nearly 10,000 GWh.

Elaine Jarry, country representative of Geres—an NGO promoting sustainable energy and combating climate change—said that energy efficiency is crucial for garment factories due to climate change and the need for cleaner construction.

“The garment factories need to adopt energy-efficiency measures to stay competitive and relevant,” she said. “The adoption of energy efficiency can help factories reduce costs and ensure smooth transitions.”

Jarry emphasized the importance of energy efficiency to meet national targets and for the country to remain attractive to investors.

Tin Mola, infrastructure lead of the economic development program CAPRED funded by Australia, said that CAPRED has focused on demonstrating the viability of the ESCO [energy service companies] business model in Cambodia to ensure that investment in energy efficiency is supported, which involves an energy-service company providing capital and expertise.

“If you look at the national energy efficiency policy, you see a long list of works or work plans,” Mola said. “The ESCO business model is an alternative, innovative financing model because energy efficiency investment costs money.” The model assists large energy consumers in investing in more efficient equipment, which can help these companies lower energy expenses and boost their competitiveness, he added.

According to people in the field, despite national policies promoting energy efficiency, gaps in regulations, limited data and a shortage of skilled professionals continue to slow Cambodia’s push toward its ambitious energy transition goals.

Elaine Jarry of the NGO Geres said that the organization has worked with the government with the aim of reducing the gap between actual and ambitious energy efficiency targets through realistic solutions and multi-stakeholder approaches. Recent and ongoing projects have included improved cook stoves, charcoal projects, and innovative low-impact living projects.

Vongchanh Kinnaleth, researcher at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC), said that the institute has been playing a role in supporting the development of a skilled workforce in energy efficiency, focusing on training human resources, particularly in engineering.

“ITC offers training programs for certified energy managers and energy auditors,” she said. “The training programs aim to address the limited professional skills in energy efficiency.”

ITC collaborates with energy consumers and development partners to promote the importance of energy management and certify professionals, she added.

Tin Mola of CAPRED explained that the ESCO (energy service companies) model is challenging but promising due to the clear commercial incentives. However, the lack of data records from factories is a significant challenge in implementing the ESCO model, she said.

“CAPRED is working on developing energy performance contracts and measurement and verification processes [and] ESCOs need access to finance to scale up their operations,” she said, pointing out the bond policies to support energy efficiency in 2026 and calling for effective implementation of existing policies and tweaking them to make them better.

During the discussions, Mahfuzur Rahman of GGGI suggested implementing the energy management program and designating energy consumers, while Rey Sopheak of UNIDO stressed the need for actual numbers and results after policy implementation. Elaine Jarry of Geres added that awareness and basic settings for energy-consumption reduction are important.

Cambodia aims for a significant clean energy transition, targeting 70 percent renewable energy by 2030. The Cambodian government also intends to attract industries such as car-part production and electronics manufacturing, which are expected to raise energy demand to 38,600 GWh annually by 2030 due to their high energy consumption.",https://img.cambodianess.com/uploads/article/10-2025/1759566154.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:31.467062

Several high-ranking government officials have raised serious concerns about energy storage — namely, does it even exist, and even if it does exist, then isn’t it too expensive? Apparently those concerns are not top of mind for the judges of the prestigious Earthshot Prize. They have just tapped the US iron-air battery startup Form Energy to join 14 other finalists in the final round. The hotly competitive, highly selective global program saw almost 2,500 other promising nominees try and fail to make the final cut this year.

Does Energy Storage Actually Exist?

Regardless of the official US position on energy storage, the Founder and President of the Earthshot Prize seems convinced that it exists. That would be Prince William, who had this to say as the program arrives at its five-year anniversary:

“The Earthshot Prize has shown that the answers to our planet’s greatest challenges not only already exist, but that they are firmly within our grasp.”

Is he delusional? Maybe! Either way, Form Energy’s iron-air battery worked its way through the Earthshot Prize selection process to rise to the top of the Fix Our Climate category, so in all likelihood it does exist.

The finalist stage is also a rare, celebration-worthy achievement for the US. The EarthShot judges have tapped 60 finalists since the program launched in 2020. Only a scant handful of US-based firms have reached the final round.

The Form Energy Iron-Air Solution: Follow The Money

Of course, the real question about energy storage is not an existential one. It’s a duration one.

Today’s lithium-ion batteries typically last about four hours or less, enabling them to fill in during peak demand periods. They can also be paired with virtual power plants and other modern 21st century technologies to forestall the need to build expensive new gas peaker plants, and to introduce more wind and solar power into the grid.

However, we are 25% into the 21st century and gas power plants are still very much in demand. The need for more powerful, more economical wind and solar energy storage platforms was already clear when Form Energy launched in 2017, with plans to develop an iron-air long-duration battery based on the principle of “reversible rusting.” The company soon coalesced around a product that can deliver electricity for 100 hours. In addition to duration and cost, iron-air technology also gets points on supply chain and fire safety, too.

That sounds simple enough, but the devil is in the details. Iron has been explored as an energy storage material for decades without gaining much traction, two key challenges being scale-up and efficiency.

Form Energy has been hammering away at the problem since its launch in 2017, with a $9 million Series A assist from Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, and The Engine among others, followed by a $40 million Series B round in 2019, a $76 million Series C round in 2020, and onward to $240 million in Series D, and another $450 million (Series E), and then another $405 million (Series F) last year.

CleanTechnica’s Steve Hanley has been following the company regularly up through last year, when he took note of the company’s forthcoming energy storage project in Maine. The article attracted dozens of comments ranging from “I think this is really promising” to “this does not look like a good battery.”

Safety & Cost-Cutting

Comments aside, Earthshot Prize is not the only entity to determine that Form Energy falls on the “really promising” side of the scale. Form already has a number of contracts and utility partners in hand. The company also passed a key fire safety test last December, when it demonstrated that the iron-air battery conforms to UL9540A standards at the cell level. When battery cells meet those standards, there is no need for further testing at the module or system level.

“UL9540A is a critical safety benchmark in the energy storage industry, designed to evaluate a battery’s potential for thermal runaway and its ability to prevent the spread of heat or fire,” Form explains.

“Form Energy’s iron-air battery cells underwent rigorous testing, including multiple short-circuit failure modes in both charging and discharging conditions,” the company adds. “Even when subjected to extreme scenarios, such as charging while short-circuited or overcharging for seven continuous days, the cells remained stable with no uncontrolled heating or thermal runaway,” the company adds.

The focus on safety is a significant cost advantage, eliminating the need for fireproofing systems. The inherent safety of the system can also smooth the way for approval in urban environments and other locations where fire risk raises public concerns.

Next Steps For Energy Storage In The US

No word yet on whether or not the White House will celebrate Form Energy’s selection as an Earthshot finalist, vaulting the US into the upper ranks of a high profile global competition. After all, it’s almost like being nominated for a Nobel Prize.

The Energy and Interior Departments have already weighed in on the matter, along with the Environmental Protection Agency. Having thoroughly investigated the question of whether or not energy storage costs too much, even if it does exist, the heads of these three agencies have determined, well, who knows what.

Meanwhile, innovation in the the energy storage field continues apace, and other long duration alternatives to lithium-ion batteries have been cropping up. Last year BloombergNEF ran the numbers and noted that these new systems face the challenge of Li-ion’s long head start on cost, including economies of scale and mature supply chains. Still, BNEF determined that thermal and compressed air systems have already closed the gap.

“Thermal energy storage and compressed air storage are the least expensive LDES technologies, at $232 per kilowatt-hour and $293 per kWh of capex, respectively, data from the survey shows. For comparison, lithium-ion systems had an average capex of $304/kWh for four-hour duration systems in 2023,” BNEF noted. The survey was based on the firm’s 6+ hour definition for long duration.

In case you’re wondering, Li-ion doesn’t lend itself to the long duration format, that’s a good question. BNEF has an answer. “The unit costs of most long-duration energy storage solutions typically drop with each hour of storage added, so LDES technologies can scale more efficiently compared to lithium-ion batteries,” BNEF notes.

Long duration or not, the US energy storage market is still holding firm, despite the fantasy of a battery-free world articulated by some high ranking federal officials. The US-based global consulting firm Coherent Market Insights, for example, has just issued a new report under the title “U.S. Advanced Energy Storage Market Set to See Incredible Growth 2025–2032.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/form-energy-factory-long-duration.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 22:03:49.544449

The Hatch Act was passed in 1939 after a scandal involving Democratic candidates in the 1938 election using Works Progress Administration workers to help with their campaigns and dangled agency jobs to help win votes.

The act was amended in 1993 and again in 2012 to relax prohibitions on federal employees engaging in political activity. While both amendments weakened the law they did not change the basic tenet of the law which is prohibiting the engagement in political activity while on duty, using federal resources, or wearing a uniform.

The law specifically prohibits federal employees of the Executive Branch while on duty from engaging in partisan political activities, such as campaigning, distributing political materials, or posting partisan messages on social media.

It also specifically prohibits federal employees of the Executive Branch from using their position or official authority to influence the outcome of an election or to coerce subordinates.

And it prohibits the use of government material for political activity.

The goals are to ensure non-partisan administration of programs, protect employees from coercion, and encourage merit-based employment.

In short it prohibits executive branch employees from using the power and authority of the federal government for partisan purposes.

The current activity of federal executive branch employees appears to totally disregard the law, but that should be a surprise with an administration that has disregarded federal laws time and time again.

The attitude is “do it and let them sue because we have the Supreme Court behind us.”

A federal court judge recently ruled President Trump lacked legal authority to order National Guard troops into Los Angeles to put down demonstrations against the activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement who were going to Home Depots to round up undocumented immigrants to deport and to farms as well often grabbing people off the street while agents were unidentified, wearing masks and in civilian vehicles.

Since that time, he has sent the National Guard and federal law enforcement officials into Memphis, Portland, Oregon, and into Chicago and surrounding areas.

And the Trump administration has usurped the constitutional “power of the purse” from Congress, and is deciding what money appropriated by Congress will be spent and what will not.

This weekend the federal government is in shutdown mode because there are not enough votes in the Senate to pass a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open.

Republicans hold the majority in the House, the Senate and hold the Oval Office, but due to Senate rules, 60 votes are needed to pass budget bills that are not dressed up as reconciliation, needing only a majority to pass, which is what the One Big Beautiful Bill was when it passed the Senate by the Vice President’s one vote, and the House by four votes.

That bill contained significant cuts to the Medicaid program which will have far reaching effects across the country and here in New Hampshire leaving millions without healthcare insurance.

The bill also did not include money for the tax credits for the Medicaid expansion program passed under the Affordable Care Act, which will send insurance premiums skyrocketing for people who purchase their health insurance through the marketplace established under the bill.

Democrats sought to include the funding for the tax credits in the continuing resolution in order to help those folks to continue to afford health insurance.

As we know in New Hampshire, uninsured people using the health care system who do not pay for the services, raise the premiums for those on private health insurance programs.

If you know you have to negotiate with Democrats in the Senate to gain the needed 60 votes, but refuse to budge at the urging of the president, you have a problem and most Americans will blame the party in power when the government shuts down.

But that is not the message the president and Republicans want the public to hear, they want to blame the “far left radical” Democrats who don’t have enough votes to pass anything in Congress.

So what has the Trump administration done to convince the American people they are not to blame for closing national parks and various other government services

This is the message on the White Mountain National Forest website since the shutdown began.

“The Radical Left Democrats shut down the government. This government website will be updated periodically during the funding lapse for mission critical functions. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

If that isn’t a violation of the Hatch Act, I don’t know what is.

The US Health and Human Services website has this message on its Home page.

“Mission-critical activities of HHS will continue during the Democrat-led government shutdown. Please use this site as a resource as the Trump Administration works to reopen the government for the American people.”

This is on the State Department’s home page.

“Due to the Democrat-led shutdown, website updates will be limited until full operations resume.”

The Housing and Urban Development website has this message:

“The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need.”

The United State Department of Agriculture has the message in big bold letters on its homepage.

“Due to the Radical Left Democrat shutdown, this government website will not be updated during the funding lapse. President Trump has made it clear he wants to keep the government open and support those who feed, fuel, and clothe the American people.”

Some agencies are nondescript like commerce which simply says because of the shutdown, the website will not be updated, which is similar to what NASA posted, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s website does not even mention the shutdown.

Maybe the Trump Administration has written off anyone who frequents the EPA website believing they are all anti-Trumpers.

What is being done in Trump’s executive department by executive branch employees is clearly illegal.

But who are you going to complain to, Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is in the president’s back pocket, or one of handpicked US District Attorneys?

And even if whoever is responsible for the messages on the federal agency websites is found guilty of violating the Hatch Act, he or she will not lose his or her job as the original law required, but will only be fined.

And if they do get caught red handed, all they have to say is the president ordered the messages be put up, because he and Vice President JD Vance are exempt from the Hatch law.

This is what happens when the power and authority of the federal government is used for partisan purposes or for one person’s agenda.

This is what happens in Russia with Vladimir Putin, in Hungary with Viktor Orbáne and in Turkey with Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

You can no longer believe anything the government tells you, and that is ruinous and will take generations to work through, if ever.
