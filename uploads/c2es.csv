Ford says it plans to shift in 2026 to production of large storage battery systems at its Kentucky plants. It is massive change to commonwealth economic hopes that soared in 2021 when Ford and SK On of Korea announced plans to invest $5.8 billion and create 5,000 jobs at twin factories along I-65 in Hardin County. Customer demand for EVs has not materialized as expected and the federal government has ended cash incentives supporting their purchase as well as dropping vehicle mileage goals that EVs aimed to achieve.

Battery energy storage business

Ford is launching a new business — including sales and service — to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid. Ford plans to repurpose existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market. This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility. These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers.

Leveraging more than a century of manufacturing expertise and licensed advanced battery technology, Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months, positioning the company to capture share in the growing U.S. battery energy storage systems market. Ford currently plans to deploy at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Ford states in a new release that it is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business. As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.

This approach prioritizes affordability, choice and profits. Ford will expand powertrain choice — including a range of hybrids and extended-range electric propulsion — while focusing its pure electric vehicle development on its flexible Universal EV Platform for smaller, affordable models. It is stopping production of the F-150E that was to use the EV batteries manufactured in Kentucky and making that vehicle an extended range hybrid.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

These actions provide a path to profitability in Model e by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The actions will also improve profits in Ford Blue and Ford Pro over time with early signs of benefits in 2026. As a result, Ford expects to post about $19.5 billion in special costs on its corporate books, the majority in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remainder in 2026 and 2027. As part of these special items, the company expects $5.5 billion in cash effects, with the majority paid in 2026 and the remainder in 2027.

Ford and its subsidiaries do plan to hire thousands of people across America, reinforcing the company’s leadership as the top employer of U.S. hourly autoworkers.

More gas, hybrids and low-cost EVs

By 2030, Ford expects approximately 50% of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.

Ford will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform. This next-generation architecture is engineered to underpin a high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles designed to be accessible to millions of customers.

The first vehicle from the Universal EV Platform will be the fully connected midsize pickup truck assembled at Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

Ford plans to expand hybrids with a range of executions based on customer needs and duty cycle — economical, performance hybrids and hybrids with exportable power. Ford is enhancing its strategy for larger trucks and SUVs to better align with customer demand for capability, towing and range, which includes adding extended-range electric options to its lineup.

As part of this plan, Ford’s next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture and be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Production of the current generation F-150 Lightning has concluded as Ford redeploys employees to Dearborn Truck Plant to support a third crew for F-150 gas and hybrid truck production as a result of the Novelis fires.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”",https://ae-lane-report.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/08134133/BlueOval-SK-Battery-Park-Ghafari.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 11:05:35.052723

This forward momentum continued despite evolving supply chains and ongoing policy uncertainty.

Overall Q3 installations increased 31% year-over-year, though the market declined 6% compared to Q2 2025’s record highs. The utility-scale storage segment drove growth with 4.6 GW installed in Q3, a 27% increase year-over-year, with 82% of installed capacity concentrated in Texas and California.

The residential storage market continued its expansion for the sixth consecutive quarter, installing 647 MW in Q3, a 70% year-over-year increase. California, Arizona and Illinois led deployments as attachment rates reached new highs. Wood Mackenzie projects Q4 2025 will set a record for the residential sector as customers accelerate installations ahead of the Sec. 25D ITC expiration.

The community, commercial and industrial (CCI) segment installed 33 MW in Q3, down 8% year-over-year. California captured 54% of installations with 17.8 MW, while Illinois emerged as a key growth market alongside Massachusetts, driven by state rebate programs and community storage projects.

“Strong growth in the U.S. energy storage market reflects a simple reality: Meeting rising demand and keeping the grid reliable increasingly requires storage,” said John Hensley, ACP Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis. “These installations deliver the flexible, reliable grid support America needs today, boosting reliability and keeping power bills in check.”

Although domestic battery manufacturing continues to ramp up to meet new tariffs and non-foreign entities of concern (FEOC) requirements for the ITC, Wood Mackenzie projects near-term supply chain adjustments and constraints will drive an 11% contraction in the U.S. utility-scale storage market in 2026 and an 8% decline in 2027. However, the market is positioned for strong recovery, with double-digit year-over-year growth projected for 2028 and 2029 as domestic manufacturing capacity comes online.

Overall, Wood Mackenzie forecasts nearly 93 GW of storage will be installed across the United States over the next five years. Notably, the utility-scale five-year forecast has increased 15% compared to pre-One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) projections, while the CCI segment is projected to grow 23% from 2025 to 2029.

“Despite new federal policies and tariffs, the market fundamentals remain exceptionally strong,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. “Continued access to the ITC, cost-competitive domestic cell manufacturing, merchant revenue potential, state policy and load growth are driving our increased five-year outlook.”

California’s Net Billing Tariff (NBT), Massachusetts’ Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target (SMART) 3.0 and Illinois’ rebate programs are sustaining steady CCI deployment through 2029. Meanwhile, the residential segment’s shift toward third-party ownership models — which accounted for 57% of the market in Q3 2025 — is helping to mitigate the impact of the Sec. 25D expiration.

Allison Weis, Global Head of Storage at Wood Mackenzie, said “We’re seeing states step up with innovative programs, grids increasingly reliant on storage for reliability and costs at record lows. The industry’s ability to navigate these challenges and maintain a 15% increase in our five-year utility forecast since the passage of the OBBA demonstrates that storage has evolved from an emerging technology to an essential grid resource.”

Groups that work in Florida for environmental justice are voicing concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency putting off a big decision.

The agency’s 2024 methane rule would require major reductions in methane emissions and other air pollution from the oil and gas industry. The move to delay implementing it for another 18 months has drawn strong criticism from groups – including WE ACT for Environmental Justice, which says local communities bear the health and economic burdens of this pollution.

Yosef Robele, federal policy manager for WE ACT, said the delay directly puts public health protections at risk.

“This delay is, unfortunately, more likely than not going to result in unnecessary deaths and increased hospital visits,” he said, “or continuation of high rates of ER visits; public health burdens being placed on communities near it.”

The EPA’s own analysis shows the methane rule could prevent 1,500 premature deaths and 100,000 asthma attacks each year. Environmental groups say delaying enforcement undermines protections for communities living closest to industrial emissions.

Florida doesn’t have the same concentration of oil and gas refinery sites as does Louisiana or Texas, but some neighborhoods face related risks from landfills, gas infrastructure and industrial emitters.

Robele warned that without stronger federal standards, methane and toxic pollutants will continue to worsen asthma, heat-related illnesses and hurricane-driven exposure, especially for lower-income areas that already struggle with medical costs.

“With increased extreme weather events, as well as many other impacts,” he said, “this is just going to continue hitting us harder every year that we delay important actions such as this one.”

The EPA has pushed compliance at least into next year, and advocates say they’re evaluating legal and policy options to ensure the rule is ultimately implemented. They argue stronger methane standards would reduce pollution, lower long-term health costs and help states such as Florida better withstand escalating climate-related disasters.

Shortly after news broke that Ford and South Korean battery firm SK On were ending a US battery manufacturing joint venture, Ford announced a series of actions that it said will redeploy capital to meet customer demand and ‘drive profitable growth’.

It will shift to ‘higher-return opportunities’, adding trucks and vans to its lineup and launching a new, ‘high-growth’ battery energy storage business.

Notably, SK On said it will likely use the battery manufacturing facility it took in the joint venture split for energy storage system (ESS) manufacturing, too.

The US-based carmaker has also cancelled plans to produce larger EVs where ‘the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes’.

The F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck has been discontinued. Ford had a vehicle-to-home (V2H) bidirectional charging partnership with US residential solar and energy storage installer and leasing company Sunrun for the F-150 Lightning, launched in 2021. The carmaker said a forthcoming next-generation F-150 Lightning would be an extended range electric vehicle (EREV), i.e., a hybrid pairing batteries with backup generation.

Ford had already scrapped plans for a three-row electric SUV because there was no path to profitability as the vehicle would have to be high-priced to cover the cost of the large battery required to power it. The company previously recorded huge losses as it slashed the price of its Model e EV to the extent it was unprofitable.

Instead, Ford reaffirmed that it will maintain its focus on its Ford Universal EV Platform for smaller models, separately expanding its powertrain range to include hybrid vehicles.

Ford president and CEO Jim Farley, speaking on the Bloomberg Talks podcast hosted by media outlet Bloomberg, said that the new plans were driven by “the customer changing their decision”.

Customer choice and decision-making have been the reasoning used by US President Donald Trump as he undid much of the pro-EV legislation of the previous administration.

This is despite the fact that EV sales went way up (66%) just before tax credits ended, something that indicates a wide intention to move to an EV that had perhaps only been stalled by the cycle of new car purchasing.

Globally, the shift to EV as battery prices drop to reach cost parity with internal combustion engine (ICE) manufacturing threatens to leave the US behind.

Farley said that changed regulations were the cause of Ford’s changing strategy, but insisted that the company still plans to go 50% electric: “There are no gas guzzlers in our future at Ford but we want to offer customers choice, that’s what the President is trying to do: give people choice.”

Farley also recently praised President Trump’s move to reset US fuel standards as a “victory” for affordability.

Ford will not produce a previously planned electric commercial van for Europe, but will continue offering its electric van range in that market. It will replace a planned electric commercial van for North America with gas and hybrid models that it said are designed to be more affordable.

On the company’s BlueOval City campus, Tennessee Electric Vehicle Centre, will be renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant and produce gas-powered trucks; likewise, its Ohio assembly plant will focus on a gas- and hybrid-powered commercial van.

Storage shift

Ford said it will repurpose existing battery manufacturing capacity in Kentucky, leveraging underutilised EV battery capacity to serve the ESS market, with the site converted to manufacture 5MWh+ advanced lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery energy storage systems (BESS).

Speaking again to Bloomberg, Farley said the company is targeting 20GWh production at the Kentucky site in “a big pivot that is profit positive for the company”, due to land in late 2027.

When pushed by podcast host Matt Miller, Farley conceded that the carmaker is, in Miller’s words, “partnering, effectively, with a Chinese company” in its storage plans, but added: “We have a licensing agreement but we feel it’s better to build these batteries in the US with American workers […] The best way to compete with the Chinese is to get close to the IP and run the plants at Ford.”

He also clarified that the company will “actually be selling the huge storage containers” to utilities and data centre companies, not “just the cells as a contract manufacturer”.

This suggests the company will assemble BESS units, while other comments Farley made referenced servicing too.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blt85cdfeb44fbd411b/69414f5addf354b5c827eaf1/ford_doug_field.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-16 11:06:11.164597

The company will no longer make large-vehicle EVs, instead developing a Universal EV Platform for smaller, affordable models.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

By 2030, Ford expects approximately 50% of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025. Ford will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform. This next-generation architecture is engineered to underpin a high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable EVs designed to be accessible to millions of customers. The first vehicle from the Universal EV Platform will be the fully connected midsize pickup truck assembled at Louisville (Kentucky) Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

The next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture and be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Production of the current generation F-150 Lightning has concluded.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love — 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration — and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”

Launching a battery energy storage system business

Ford is launching a new business — including sales and service — to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid. Ford plans to repurpose existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, BESS modules and 20-ft DC container systems at this facility. Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months and reach at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Separately, Ford will utilize BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, Michigan, to produce smaller Amp-hour cells for use in residential energy storage solutions. This plant remains on track to begin manufacturing LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming midsize electric truck, the first model on the new Universal EV Platform.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/blueoval-plant-michigan-ford.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 11:09:14.636629

A priority for any tech company should be maximizing efficiency – from chip and model design through development of the data center itself.
AI companies that are serious about their climate impact should account for and seek to reduce these potentially significant upstream methane emissions.
What steps are you taking to ensure that data center neighbors and ratepayers are not burdened with additional costs or pollution?
The density of computing power within AI data centers requires sophisticated cooling systems to keep chips functioning.","The rush to commercialize AI is transforming the technology industry from asset-light, knowledge-based companies to capital- and energy-intensive infrastructure developers. Already enabled by an unprecedented surge in capital, AI spending is projected to reach more than $400 billion in 2025, and McKinsey projects data centers to soak up nearly $7 trillion of capital expenditure worldwide by 2030.

The industry’s focus on speed and scale translates to an urgent need for investors to understand the physical footprint and supply chain risks of AI and its ecosystem – the utilities powering AI data centers, the chipmakers providing hardware, real estate firms developing massive data complexes, and the suppliers of critical minerals and other commodities for tech hardware. Failure to do so could put invested capital at risk.

The “build at any cost” approach of the past few years presents challenges for communities and the public interest. AI infrastructure, especially emissions from the electricity that runs data centers and the water often used to cool them, has real implications for human health and the environment. How that infrastructure is planned, built and paid for affects both nearby communities and electricity customers across wide regions – not to mention the global impacts of climate change driven by AI-related greenhouse gas emissions.

If developed in the right way, AI investments could usher in a clean, modernized power system that lowers electricity costs and helps tame climate change. But the current path points in another direction: a breakneck pace that stresses the environment in myriad ways, ignores efficiency and innovations that can improve environmental outcomes and reduce costs, and risks a backlash – from regulators, customers, and the public at large – with a host of negative consequences for tech companies and their backers. Now is the time for investors to engage with the sector on how companies are incorporating sustainability drivers into data center growth.

Here are five questions that investors can ask technology companies to start the conversation:

1. How are you leveraging efficiency, innovation and zero carbon electricity across the AI supply chain?

Demand for clean electricity is being outpaced by the intense energy needs of AI computing, putting a strain on tech companies’ climate targets. A priority for any tech company should be maximizing efficiency – from chip and model design through development of the data center itself. Similarly, there is a range of innovative customer-side approaches that can shift, manage, or reduce power demand, and tech companies should make full use of these to reduce environmental footprint and cost.

Beyond these measures, data centers should be powered wherever possible from carbon-free energy resources. Developers should engage utilities to accelerate the deployment of clean energy and enabling technologies like energy storage, and support decarbonizing the grid over time to improve the long-term environmental performance of their data center assets.

A range of promising practices use efficiency and innovative technologies to manage energy use and associated costs. Google uses grid emissions data to shift some large computing workloads to times when renewable power is available. Apple has invested heavily in battery-paired solar projects to expand clean power supply at times of peak demand. Tech firms should be able to show how they’re systematically addressing the need for zero carbon power throughout their data center planning, offer load flexibility to support the grid, and maximize opportunities to reduce energy consumption.

2. Where your power is supplied by natural gas, either onsite or indirectly through a utility company, what measures are you taking to minimize carbon dioxide and methane emissions?

Natural gas accounts for over 40% of US power generation, and powering data centers from existing grid infrastructure or newly added generation can translate to increased fossil fuel pollution. Research from Goldman Sachs suggests natural gas use for AI could increase global carbon emissions by a cumulative 220 million tons – equivalent to Spain’s yearly emissions – through 2030 before carbon-free energy supply catches up with demand growth.

Where natural gas use is unavoidable in the near term, companies should address the associated CO₂ emissions through long-term planning for low-carbon alternatives and explore mitigation technologies such as high-quality carbon capture, utilization and storage.

Upstream from the utility, leaks and intentional venting of methane – a greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the warming power of CO₂ over 20 years – drive up data center climate impacts. Methane emissions differ significantly between regions: aerial surveys find methane loss rates varying by a factor of eight between the highest- and lowest-emitting sourcing areas.

AI companies that are serious about their climate impact should account for and seek to reduce these potentially significant upstream methane emissions. Companies should track and report upstream methane emissions from data center energy use, and engage with their fuel and electricity suppliers to source lower-methane-emissions natural gas. This could include prioritizing gas supplied by members of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, a framework for measuring and reducing methane emissions, or supporting credible efforts to measure, report, and verify lower-emissions gas.

3. What steps are you taking to ensure that data center neighbors and ratepayers are not burdened with additional costs or pollution?

The large power demands of data centers can strain local grids and trigger costly investments in system upgrades – with costs passed along to other utility customers and even to other utilities across the region. Federal data shows that US average electricity prices increased 13% over the past three years and will continue to climb, and studies show that growing demands on the power grid from data centers are contributing to the run-up.

In addition, due to gaps in the patchwork of federal, state and local emissions rules, local communities can bear the brunt of air pollution such as smog-producing nitrogen oxides and particulates from backup diesel generators and other new fossil fuel equipment deployed to meet data center load. These impacts often fall disproportionately on lower-income communities and in areas with elevated industrial air pollution.

Tech companies should be expected to pay the full cost of the generation and associated infrastructure they require to offer AI products and services. Investors should consider how companies are addressing local and regional impacts of data center growth to minimize impacts and preserve social license to operate, including how they engage with communities, utilities and regulators to take full responsibility for their power system costs and not impose additional pollution burdens.

4. How do you incorporate water availability and water stress into your data center design and siting processes?

The density of computing power within AI data centers requires sophisticated cooling systems to keep chips functioning. Many cooling systems rely on circulating liquids to manage this heat, and there are often tradeoffs between the energy intensity and water intensity of cooling system design. Analysts further distinguish between the water directly used within data center operations, which can be on the scale of water use by a small town, and the indirect water use associated with generating electricity, which can be far higher – 80% or more of a data center’s water footprint.

A recent Ceres report found that data center water use in Phoenix is expected to increase by 400% in the coming years, driving increased water stress year-round with higher seasonal spikes. With industry development projections heavily concentrated in a limited number of states, assessing both regional water availability and local water stress at proposed data center locations is necessary to develop a clear picture of siting trade-offs. Investments in water resilience, for example through water conservation, infrastructure improvements and contaminant clean-up, can reduce local water stress and bring value to neighboring communities.

As data center deployment accelerates – including in water-stressed regions like Arizona, parts of Texas, and southern California – investors should evaluate operational risks from water availability and water stress, as well as regulatory risks and community concerns linked to the social and ecosystem impacts of water stress.

5. How are you engaging policymakers and regulators on enabling policy priorities?

The pace of data center growth has made long-standing bottlenecks in the US power system more apparent, and solutions more urgent. In some cases, changes in policy or regulation could make the power system more efficient, effective, and responsive to the people and businesses that rely on it.

One urgent policy issue is the lengthy delays that affect interconnection – the process of bringing new energy supply like solar and wind farms onto the grid. Across most of the country, long interconnection queues mean that projects take years to come online, while new load from data centers can be connected more quickly. Tech companies can engage on regulatory approaches to better match those timelines or connect clean energy resources onsite at data centers to speed access.

Another topic ripe for policy engagement is large load flexibility. Some data center operators are exploring ways to shift computing load, and the associated energy use, between times of day or geographic location to reduce strain on the grid. Incorporating large load flexibility into regulatory structures, with appropriate controls for power system management and safety, could support the use of these approaches to meet near-term electricity needs through efficient use of existing resources. Tech company engagement in policy design can support regulatory updates that align technical capabilities with system-wide benefits.

Q: What advice do you have for other states or large municipalities who want to see deeper penetration of clean energy assets in underserved communities?","As federal climate funding faces uncertainty, state-level coordination has become essential for keeping clean energy projects moving forward, particularly in underserved communities. Ben Dueweke, Director of Michigan’s Climate Investment Hub, talks with us about how the Hub is working to connect capital providers, CDFIs, and community organizations to accelerate equitable climate solutions, and why creating accessible entry points for everyday residents and small businesses may be the key to unlocking broader participation in the clean energy transition.

Q: Can you tell me a bit about the Climate Investment Hub, its genesis and purpose?

A: The Michigan Climate Investment Hub was established by the State of Michigan’s Office of Climate and Energy (under EGLE), who recognized that achieving the State’s climate goals will not only require activating massive amounts of capital, but also additional coordination among public, private, philanthropic and community partners to deploy that capital.

The $20B in funding that was to be released via the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) presented an immediate use case for organizing Michigan’s ecosystem around climate-related finance in order to capitalize on these resources. Though the EPA has since frozen access to these funds, the work of the Hub transcends that program and we will continue to act as a market convener and systems integrator, working with capital providers, lenders, developers, local governments and community organizations to align financial resources with project needs.

Q: What are your thoughts about the key barriers to a broad-based participation in this transition, besides financing?

A: There are absolutely barriers to accelerating the pace of deployment when it comes to clean energy and other decarbonization strategies. One of the most persistent barriers in Michigan (and nationally) is the lack of accessible, trusted entry points for everyday residents, small businesses, community organizations, and public-sector stakeholders to explore project ideas. You would be hard pressed to find someone managing a small business or running a nonprofit that wouldn’t love to put solar on their roof or upgrade their heating and cooling equipment to be more efficient and affordable. However, the current market conditions effectively demand that folks are equipped with the technical fluency and understanding of the options, the benefits, and the means (financial and technical) to actualize this work – which simply isn’t the case.

If we can solve for this – for example with a more robust ecosystem of resources focused on project ideation, pre-development, and development, we can start to build more momentum. This will have a positive feedback effect on jobs and economic growth in the sector, put downward pressure on prices and ultimately expand access to these technologies.

Q: As federal clean energy and climate resilience funding, tax credits and other supports face significant cuts, what is the opportunity for state-level public ecosystem coordinator, and why has that role become more critical for CDFIs and clean energy-finance providers right now?

A: It’s so important that we maintain forward momentum with climate and decarbonization work now, and into the future. Though I’m discouraged by the recent policy changes, the fact is there is an ever-growing demand for more affordable, reliable, and resilient energy systems. CDFIs are such a great example of how climate and clean energy work can augment and be additive to work already being done to strengthen our communities. Whether it’s small business lending, affordable housing, economic development — the CDFI coalition of Michigan and the Detroit CDFI coalition have members that are supporting communities across the state with financing and resources that align with the work of the Hub. We have been working with both Coalitions (who have aligned and coordinated their climate-specific committees) to shape strategy on advancing community resilience and climate solutions through coordinated action in partnership, capital, policy and learning.

The Hub is also aligned and partnered with Michigan Saves (the state’s green bank) and Lean and Green Lending, who administers the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (or C-PACE) program. These two organizations are really the anchors of climate finance in the state, and we’re working with them to support project pipeline development, coordinating with national efforts, and generally building greater capacity.

Q: Understanding that CDFIs and other community-focused lenders have been slow to come into this space, from your vantage point, what do state-level finance ecosystems need most in this moment to keep projects moving to market?

A: I mentioned before the need for better and more accessible ‘entry points’ where folks can take ideas and aspirations, and mold them into projects that are financeable and beneficial for them. Part of the Hub’s work going into 2026 will involve collecting and indexing more data on the interest and demand for climate resilience and clean energy projects across the state. By achieving a better, data-based understanding of the project demand, we can better articulate financial needs, technical and capacity gaps, and also projected benefits and outcomes of the work. This information and synthesis can be used to strategically drive resources to fill these needs as well as to make the case to capital providers to continue to drive their dollars here to Michigan.

The state has an incredible ecosystem of resources – from grant challenges administered by EGLE and our Public Service Commission, to a Tax Credit Technical Assistance Center supporting elective pay for nonprofits. When I’m speaking to people on the project development or sponsor side of things, I’ve found it rare that everyone knows about all of these resources, and I think the role of a Hub as a central information point could be beneficial to many states.

Q: What advice do you have for other states or large municipalities who want to see deeper penetration of clean energy assets in underserved communities?

A: Building two-way trust with local anchor institutions can help both better understand the pain points of a community as well as broaden the understanding of the options and potential benefits of clean energy and other decarbonization strategies. Climate resilience strategies can almost always be applied as a remedy to existing challenges — whether it’s the need for more jobs in a community, healthier housing or more affordable energy costs. We need to further drive the connection between the problems of today and the solutions of tomorrow.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_705996939.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:13.908935

As the state’s water and wastewater agencies have noted, the tariff program increases energy reliability for emergency and essential services, including water pumping needed to fight fires.
Newsom recently touted the jobs benefits of this tariff program’s projects in his California Jobs First initiative, but he will kill those very same jobs by letting the CPUC end this project.
All of this funding and these benefits will be lost, however, if the comission adopts its proposed decision to end the BioMAT program on Thursday.
That means continuing the BioMAT program to reduce wildfires, provide reliable clean energy and create good jobs and economic development.","On Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first day in office, he held a press conference on wildfires and called on state agencies to do more to fight the growing wildfire crisis. Since then, wildfires have only grown more deadly and more expensive. Yet the California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled on Dec. 18 to end an important wildfire reduction and climate protection program, called the Bioengineering Market Adjusting Tariff Program (BioMAT), which requires utilities to buy power from small local projects that convert forest and other organic waste into energy.

The CPUC’s decision to end this program will cause serious harm across the state, including the loss of hundreds of good jobs and nearly $100 million dollars of federal and state funding. Ending the tariff program will also take an important wildfire mitigation tool off the table — even though the CPUC has acknowledged that wildfires are the single biggest cause of increasing electricity costs.

Tribes, water agencies, fire protection and resource conservation districts have all asked the comission to extend the program. As the state’s water and wastewater agencies have noted, the tariff program increases energy reliability for emergency and essential services, including water pumping needed to fight fires.

The CPUC’s decision to end the tariff program is painfully ironic and just plain wrong: First, the Newsom administration frequently criticizes the federal government for ignoring the law, but the CPUC (with five commissioners appointed by the governor) will violate at least two state laws by ending this program before the requirements of those laws are met.

The Newsom administration also criticizes the Trump administration for ignoring science, but the public utilities comission is doing the same thing by ignoring the state’s many climate change, air quality and wildfire reduction plans that call for the tariff program.

Newsom recently touted the jobs benefits of this tariff program’s projects in his California Jobs First initiative, but he will kill those very same jobs by letting the CPUC end this project.

The California Public Utilities Commission’s hypocrisy is deeply troubling: The agency has repeatedly found that the program helps mitigate wildfires and provides other important public health, safety and climate benefits. Now, it’s claiming that it is ending the BioMAT program to save ratepayers money, but it has never quantified the supposed savings and ignores the actual ratepayer savings that this program provides by reducing wildfire costs and increasing energy reliability.

Ironically, while the CPUC is about to end the tariff program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture just approved a loan guarantee for a $42 million forest BioMAT project in the Central Sierras. Both the Newsom Administration and the U.S. Forest Service have provided funding to this project to reduce wildfire risks in an extreme wildfire risk area. The Calaveras County Water District also supports the project, which will help ensure reliable and lower cost energy for the water agency and surrounding community. It will also create good jobs and economic development in a low-income county.

All of this funding and these benefits will be lost, however, if the comission adopts its proposed decision to end the BioMAT program on Thursday.

Newsom was very clear about the urgency of reducing wildfires, the need to follow the science and the law and the importance of protecting public health and safety. The governor should remind the CPUC that those are still the state’s priorities. That means continuing the BioMAT program to reduce wildfires, provide reliable clean energy and create good jobs and economic development.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/ld5ejl/picture312610524/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_209_252210_JV_Newsom.JPG,N,,2025-12-16 11:06:14.482359

And the college is building on its commitment to clean energy and environmental education simultaneously.
RMI collaboration Catawba has long been a sustainability innovator in higher education, supported by nearly two decades of partnership with RMI.
We’re tackling carbon and deferred maintenance simultaneously.” Catawba College President David Nelson echoed this perspective, framing it within a broader lens of stewardship.","How a small liberal arts college in North Carolina is investing in clean energy, offering a blueprint for other institutions to follow.

The most inspiring colleges aren’t just places of learning. They live their values on campus every day. Catawba College — a private liberal arts institution in Salisbury, NC — has done just that. Established in 1851, it was the first college in the Southeast, and one of only 13 in the nation, to become certified carbon neutral. This is a major achievement for any college campus, particularly one with only around 1,200 students.

And the college is building on its commitment to clean energy and environmental education simultaneously. Catawba’s current capital projects include the construction of new, high-performance buildings, along with the modernization of aging infrastructure. The work is delivering multiple benefits — all while prioritizing cost efficiency. While addressing deferred maintenance, the upgrades will also enhance comfort for students and staff, as well as optimize energy use.

As a small institution, Catawba’s plans for a more resilient future offer a blueprint for other colleges and universities. As facilities age, many are facing similar priorities to maintain and enhance their campuses cost-effectively, while minimizing emissions and lowering exposure to rising energy costs.

RMI collaboration

Catawba has long been a sustainability innovator in higher education, supported by nearly two decades of partnership with RMI. Marty Pickett, RMI’s general counsel and trustee, was introduced to Catawba by our donor Fred Stanback, and Marty has served on the advisory board, alongside Stanback, of Catawba’s Center for the Environment since 2009, a “coming home” of sorts since she grew up less than an hour’s drive away. RMI cofounder Amory Lovins has spoken numerous times over the years at Catawba, on topics such as “Transforming the Energy System for Security and Prosperity” and “Profitable Solutions to Climate, Oil and Proliferation.” and Lovins, Pickett, and various other RMI staff have taught at Catawba’s National Environmental Summit for High School Students for many years, emphasizing RMI’s systems thinking.

Drawing on Amory Lovins’ principles of integrative design and RMI’s expertise, the college has sought advice on various projects including a retrofit of the Center for the Environment’s building, which was a high performance building even before the Green Building Council was established, and collaborated with RMI on advancing the campus’s energy plan that includes investing in its new district energy system.

“Catawba College leadership’s bold vision and actions on sustainability, clean energy, and regenerative design make it an inspiring model for the community, higher education, and most importantly for its students and faculty” noted Marty Pickett.

Catawba’s resilient infrastructure

Since 1996, Catawba’s Center for the Environment has served as a living laboratory for hands-on education, an approach now woven throughout campus life. “We want to be leaders in the field of environmental sustainability and regenerative design,” said Lee Ball, vice president of sustainability and executive director of the Center for the Environment at Catawba. Ball has been at the forefront of initiatives that prepare students to become the next generation of sustainability leaders.

That vision first took tangible form in 2001, when students helped design the center’s original 21,000-square-foot building. Their efforts reduced projected energy consumption by 30–40 percent over the building’s lifetime compared to standard construction. They also recycled more than 86 percent of construction waste, a material circularity practice then well ahead of its time. Reusing or recycling construction waste is essential to cut a project’s resource consumption and overall embodied carbon. While the center was later renovated in 2023, the tradition of student leadership continues, with more than 60 students helping to design the college’s innovative Smokestack and new residence hall projects.

Catawba was also an early leader in its use of renewable energy in higher education. These systems not only reduce emissions but also deliver strong financial returns and provide a more reliable and resilient energy source for the future. In the 1980s, the college installed solar thermal systems, a way to heat water by warming it with the sun. That was followed in 2015 by approximately 837 kW of solar panels. At the time, this installation produced more renewable energy than all other North Carolina higher education institutions combined, while delivering savings forecast to total $5 million over 20 years. In 2024, the college added another 55 kW of solar, with further expansion planned.

A complementary focus of Catawba’s renewable energy strategy is its use of geoexchange systems, which use the Earth’s consistent temperatures below ground to deliver energy-efficient heating and cooling year-round. The college installed its first “open-loop” system in the 1990s using water from local aquifers.

Now a new, more ambitious geoexchange system is taking center stage in the school’s District Energy and Modernization (DEM) project. In 2024, the college drilled 39 wells for a closed-loop geoexchange system that circulates water through a contained pipe network. This updated design is more efficient, more durable, and easier to upgrade than the original open-loop system. It is part of a four-phase installation that will eventually provide heating and cooling to 26 campus buildings. As part of this buildout, wells are being placed beneath the soccer field to centralize maintenance and maximize use of space, says David Karlsgodt, vice president for infrastructure, energy, and sustainability at Washington, D.C.-based Brailsford & Dunlavey. Once complete, “the system will cut at least 265 MMBtu of gas and 145,724 kWh of purchased electrical energy [per year], reducing carbon emissions by 51 metric tons.”

Modernizing for a more resilient future

The DEM project spans nearly every corner of campus and conveniently coincides with significant upgrades to aging equipment and facilities. “Catawba wants to upgrade to operational carbon neutrality in a smart way,” explained Jason Volz, project manager and partner at CMTA, an engineering firm that specializes in sustainable and high-performance building systems. He noted that the college is aligning deferred maintenance needs with a shift toward district energy to move away from fossil fuels, while improving student, staff, and faculty comfort, cutting carbon emissions, and reducing long-term costs.

One example is the Abernethy Physical Education complex, a 90,000-square-foot facility with a pool but limited air conditioning, leaving spaces such as the main lobby uncomfortable in North Carolina’s heat and humidity. Many of Catawba’s older buildings face similar issues, from outdated HVAC systems to insufficient wall insulation and vapor barriers. Over the years, efforts to improve comfort in some older buildings have been scattershot, but achieving decarbonization targets now requires a more holistic approach.

“If I address the HVAC but I don’t address the envelope, I’m just heating and cooling the outside,” Volz explained. Still, there are some advantages hidden in this legacy infrastructure. Several older buildings are already connected into the campus’s original geoexchange system, which means they can connect to the new system at minimal expense — a welcome cost savings brought about by an innovative investment over 20 years ago that continues to pay off today.

Decarbonizing old and new

One of the clearest symbols of Catawba’s decarbonization efforts is its Smokestack building. A coal-fired power plant that operated from the 1950s to 1990s, the structure stood as a reminder of past dependence on dirtier, more harmful fuel sources. Today, the building is being transformed into a 10,000-square-foot student life hub and living laboratory that will be connected to the DEM and use photovoltaic panels, reaching net-zero (or better) once complete.

The Smokestack’s new design will emphasize harmony with the local environment, ensuring it will look as good as it performs. Additionally, the Smokestack is slated to be certified LEED Platinum and certified by the Living Building Challenge Core Imperative, which assesses not only energy and carbon performance, but also water use, ecology, aesthetics, material health, education, and more.

These decarbonization efforts also extend to new construction. In April 2025, the college broke ground on a three-story, 130-bed residence hall featuring a great room with a kitchenette, a community lounge, study rooms, laundry facilities, and other student amenities. The residence hall is designed to meet Passive House US certification — the most rigorous US building standard for energy efficiency, thermal comfort, moisture, and ventilation — and will tie into the DEM system.

According to Catawba, the residence hall will reduce energy use by 55 percent, heating loads by 44 percent, and cooling loads by 75 percent compared to typical North Carolina construction. Once open, the building will free up older dorms to undergo additional energy-saving renovations, creating a ripple effect of energy savings and comfort improvements. These investments help to address the growing impacts of climate change, while also improving student retention and laying the groundwork for future enrollment growth.

Learn, invest, save, repeat

Innovation at this scale comes at a cost, but the decision to move forward with the projects went beyond financial return. “When presenting this to the board, it was not just financial [return on investment],” said Ball. “It was recruitment, retention, our sustainability and carbon goals, and a big part of our deferred maintenance plan. We’re tackling carbon and deferred maintenance simultaneously.”

Catawba College President David Nelson echoed this perspective, framing it within a broader lens of stewardship. “I look at this from an angle of what I would call a ‘good economy’ as opposed to a ‘goods economy,’” he noted. “The word ‘economy’ is misconstrued. We use it to talk about money and finances, but economy is really the good stewardship of all that’s been entrusted to us — and that includes clean air, land, and water, and taking care of the people and the creatures that live on the land. My twist with a couple of our board members was to say, “It makes good financial sense, but it makes even better economic sense.’”

Of course, financing this initiative remains a practical reality, and the DEM represents a major commitment for the college. While Catawba has been fortunate to draw from endowments and generous donors, President Nelson emphasized that it’s also a testament to the college’s values and legacy that the board and leadership were willing to take on that challenge. Yet, a preliminary net present value (NPV) cost analysis suggests the risk is minimal. When compared with business-as-usual practices, NPV projections show the DEM will save the college approximately $10 million between 2025 and 2054 when considering costs associated with energy, operations and maintenance, and other factors.

Ball reinforced this point, saying that Catawba’s decades of successful sustainability experience make it feel less risky than it would on some other college campuses. He also sees this as an opportunity for Catawba to serve as a model. “When we have the ability to do this, maybe another campus could do some version of it,” he said.

“They can come here and learn, talk to our campus engineers or partners to help with design, or meet the people who are actually running the systems. We can explain to them in real time,” Ball said. “Here’s what it takes, these are the pain points, and this is what we like about it.”

Though unique for a small Southeastern college, Catawba’s solar power, geoexchange heating and cooling system, and other sustainability initiatives are an investment in its future — and a blueprint for other institutions charting their own decarbonization journeys.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20220315_Catawba_4400-e1761152619943.webp,N,,2025-12-16 11:08:37.218362

More than 40% of EVgo stations deployed in 2025 leverage the prefabrication approach, supporting domestic manufacturing while reducing installation time and cost

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EVgo Inc. (NASDAQ: EVGO) (“EVgo” or the “Company”), one of the nation’s largest providers of public fast charging infrastructure for electric vehicles (EVs), has deployed more than 40% of its stations this year by leveraging domestically manufactured prefabricated modular skids. EVgo exceeded its goal before year-end, driven by a high rate of new station commissionings early in the fourth quarter. The Company’s partnership with Miller Electric Company (“Miller Electric”), a leading electrical contractor based in Jacksonville, Florida, with expertise in complex electrical systems, has led to accelerated station installation timelines and a decrease in station installation costs by an average of 15%.

Prefabrication ensures consistent, high-quality assembly in a controlled environment by assembling all charging equipment onto a single base frame made from American steel and aluminum at Miller Electric’s facility before shipment to the installation site. Since the partnership first launched in 2023, EVgo’s expanded work with Miller Electric has supported local job creation. Miller Electric has scaled capacity at its prefabrication facility and employs more than 1,400 people in the Jacksonville area.

“The prefabrication model is a win-win for EVgo because we can fast-track infrastructure deployment to meet charging demand and support workforce development in this growing industry,” said Dennis Kish, President of EVgo. “Utilizing prefabricated modular skids from Miller Electric is key to scaling EVgo’s nationwide network.”

“By prefabricating EV skids, we’re able to deliver consistent, high-quality installations while reducing timelines and costs. This approach accelerates infrastructure deployment and supports domestic manufacturing and job creation—key pillars for a sustainable future. This collaboration with EVgo demonstrates innovation and efficiency in the EV charging industry,” said Pat Eliason, Group President at Miller Electric.

In addition to cost and time efficiencies, prefabrication can seamlessly integrate features that enhance customer experience such as Wi-Fi infrastructure, lighting, security cameras, and canopies.

EVgo’s prefabricated stations are now open to EV drivers in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nebraska, New York and Texas, with additional stations under development in North Carolina, Utah, and more. Prefabricated stations deployed in 2025 can charge up to 14 vehicles simultaneously, depending on the site, and exclusively feature high-power 350kW fast chargers.

Aside from wasting a ton of money, Ford revealed they no longer plan to “produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.” This likely references today’s decision to axe the F-150 Lightning EV and eventually revive it as a range-extended pickup truck.

More: The F-150 Lightning Is Dead, But It’s Coming Back As A Range-Extended EV

The company also announced they will no longer build a previously planned electric commercial van for Europe. Plans for an electric van in North America have also been dropped, but they’re being replaced by an affordable commercial van that will offer gas and hybrid engines. This model will be built at Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake starting in 2029.

Ford previously abandoned three-row EVs, but they’re still committed to new electric vehicles based on the Universal EV Platform. These will be small and affordable, with the first variant arriving in 2027 for around $30,000.

Besides hitting the brakes on most BEVs, Ford confirmed they’ll “expand powertrain choice” by offering more hybrids and range-extended electric vehicles. The company expects the mix of these three powertrains will be approximately 50% of its global volume by 2030, which would be up from 17% this year.

To help fuel this projected jump in demand, Ford is planning a range of different hybrids. Some will focus on fuel economy, while others chase performance. We can also expect hybrids with exportable power, which has become popular with customers.

On the range-extended side of things, Ford implied the second-generation F-150 Lightning will be joined by range-extended versions of their larger SUVs. This likely means we can expect to see electrified versions of the Expedition and Navigator.

Ford went on to say that by the end of the decade, nearly every vehicle will offer a hybrid or “multi-energy powertrain choice.”

Given the shift away from EVs, Ford is renaming the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center as the Tennessee Truck Plant. It will build new, affordable gas-powered trucks starting in 2029. This is a departure as the plant was originally supposed to build the next-generation F-150 Lightning.

Ford Battery Business

Despite throwing in the towel on most EVs, Ford announced plans to launch a battery energy storage system business. It will provides sales and service to support the electric grid and growing demand from data centers.

The pivot can partially be explained by the transition away from EVs as Ford has a lot of excess battery manufacturing capacity. As a result, they’re repurposing their Glendale, Kentucky plant to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. As part of the change, the facility will build “LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules, and 20-foot DC container systems.”

Ford also announced their BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan will make residential energy storage solutions. They’ll be built alongside LFP prismatic battery cells for models based on the Universal EV Platform.

In a statement, Ford CEO Jim Farley said “This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford.” He added, “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/F-150-Lightning_Exterior_Sketch_1-copy.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 08:58:28.671364

The PJM auction has emerged as a barometer of US energy inflation, with this week’s results likely to stoke increasingly heated public discourse about affordability. Surging utility bills are already shaping up to be an issue in the congressional midterm elections next year: Despite President Donald Trump saying electricity prices would be halved within a year of taking office, costs have increased. Just last month, Democrats won elections in New Jersey and Virginia — two states within the grid’s territory — as well as in Georgia, after campaigning to lower power bills.

While the so-called capacity auction is just one component of total electricity costs to consumers, it’s one of the fastest growing due to skyrocketing demand from artificial intelligence that’s straining power supplies. Data center electricity consumption accounted for 45% of the price tag in the last auction, according to Monitoring Analytics LLC, PJM’s official independent watchdog.

While 58% of military veterans treated between 2002 and 2015 had a diagnosed mental health disorder, less than half of U.S. vets seek out treatment due to the cost, lack of availability and stigma. In response, mental health professionals, veterans groups and researchers have sought alternatives to in-office treatment, finding positive results with outdoor recreation and exposure.

Although adventure-based trips like backpacking and whitewater rafting had a positive impact on veterans facing PTSD, anxiety, depression and other conditions, the Sierra Club report notes these programs are only available sporadically. Additionally, many areas lack the natural resources needed for this recreational therapy.

Veterans need access to quality natural spaces near their homes, the report says, emphasizing that this space should be accessible regardless of transportation availability, connection to organized outings, or their personal economic situations.

Air pollution can also complicate access to green spaces, as many veterans suffer from respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, making them more sensitive to pollutants, preventing them from engaging in outdoor activities.

The report examined eight cities across the U.S., including Detroit, assessing each based on the amount of vets lacking access to nature, as well as the American Lung Association’s 2025 state of the air grades.

In its assessment of Detroit, the report notes that its park system is growing, as it encompasses nearly 5,000 acres across 300 parks. While 84% of residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park, 20% of veterans lacked access to nature in their neighborhoods, with the Sierra Club rating the city a “B” for overall nature access.

However, the city’s “F” rating from the American Lung Association, low walkability and poor access to public transit, pose a barrier to veterans’ park access, the report notes.

Additionally, the neighborhoods with the highest concentrations of people of color also had access to 38% less park space than the neighborhoods with the most white residents. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the report gave Detroit a “D” rating overall.

With many veterans facing long-term respiratory, cardiovascular and mental health conditions that can be made worse by pollution, the Sierra Club emphasized the importance of maintaining protections for clean air, water and for public lands, to support nature-based therapy and limit further exposure of veterans to toxic air pollution.

“When parks are closed, air is polluted, or communities near bases suffer environmental damage, veterans—many of whom live in those areas—bear the brunt,” the report states. “Protecting the environment is not just an ecological responsibility; it’s part of the nation’s duty of care to those who served.”

The report also recommends supporting efforts to connect veterans with nature, supporting staffing and funding for public lands, and improving accessible infrastructure in parks and public land.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-15-190946.png,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:18.062640

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush.
Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
“If you’re buying solar, you’re essentially buying all the energy you’re going to use from that system all at once.
The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.","The massive tax and spending law signed in July halts a federal incentive for residential solar, and homeowners and installers are hurrying to complete projects before the end of the year. Industry experts say there are other ways to cut costs like “group buys.”

On their small farm in Wahoo, Nebraska, Rhonda McClure and her husband toss a few pumpkins over the fence to a flock of ewes. They sell market lambs and wool, some of which Rhonda uses as a fiber artist, along with garden produce and compost.

She said they’ve always tried to use sustainable practices on their farm, including rotational grazing, geothermal energy and most recently — solar.

“The solar just fits in with trying to be as independent and careful of the environment as we can,” McClure said.

For the McClures, harnessing energy from the sun allows them to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and keep their energy costs down over the long run.

A solar array they added in 2021 to help power their well and home reduced their summer energy bills from several hundred dollars per month to as low as $4, McClure said.

They added a solar battery this spring to release energy at night and act as a back-up during regional power outages.

“It’s provided a good deal of security for us to know that if we’re off grid for a while, if something happens, we can get by,” McClure said. “We have water and heat and the essential services here, for us and our livestock.”

Now they’re wrapping up another solar project, largely to provide air conditioning for a new outbuilding used to store and process wool, teach classes and host large groups of people.

McClure said they likely would have waited to install it next spring. But they bumped up the timeline when they found out the Residential Clean Energy Credit was rapidly expiring. Congress voted this summer to eliminate it at the end of 2025 through the One Big Beautiful Bill.

An incentive for home solar

The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush. But the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden kicked the deadline to 2032 for the full credit, followed by a rate phase down.

The Biden administration said the tax credit and two dozen others in the Inflation Reduction Act would “save families money on their energy bills and accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.”

Over 752,000 households claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their 2023 taxes. Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit made solar more affordable for homeowners by lowering the upfront costs and shortening the amount of time before they recoup their initial investment, said Paul Cutting.

Cutting helps homeowners identify opportunities to improve their energy efficiency and pay for them as an energy auditor with Clean Energy Districts of Iowa. The affiliation includes 15 county-level organizations across eastern Iowa and one in Wisconsin.

The cost of installing solar depends largely on the size of the home, along with its location and overall electricity usage, Cutting said. The national average is $23,500, according to the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy, but some industry experts say some residential solar projects can exceed $40,000.

“The solar tax credit being funded at the full 30% makes it pretty enticing for a homeowner to move forward with that,” Cutting said.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill cut the tax credit deadline off at the end of the year instead of its original phase out starting in 2032. Homeowners working with contractors must have their systems installed and invoices paid by Dec. 31 to qualify.

A rush on solar

Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.

That was the experience of StraightUp Solar, a company that designs and installs solar systems for homes, businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Missouri and Illinois.

“We sold out in September, and many other solar companies were selling out in July, which means their entire build schedule was full for 2025 because people wanted to get in before the tax credit expired at the end of the year,” said Eric Schneider, director of business development for StraightUp Solar.

The company’s third quarter of 2025 was the second busiest for inquiries, said Schneider. The biggest spike was in 2022 when homeowners expected an earlier tax credit to sunset before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We call it the ‘solar coaster’ in the industry because demand fluctuates up and down,” Schneider said. “Some of it’s policy driven; some of it’s interest rate driven.”

Despite the loss of the Residential Clean Energy Credit, Schneider remains optimistic about the coming year and the future of the industry at large.

The price of solar power has fallen dramatically in the last 15 years as panels have become more efficient, increasing its appeal to homeowners concerned about rising energy bills, Schneider said.

Cutting agreed.

“I imagine there’s going to be a slowdown [in 2026], but I think solar at this point probably has a lot to stand on its own.” Cutting said.

Higher electricity rates

Inflation, higher demand, natural disasters and upgrades to aging infrastructure have driven up electricity rates across the U.S. in the last five years.

And they’re expected to continue their upward trajectory, in large part due to the acceleration of artificial intelligence. Projected growth in data centers and cryptocurrency mining could increase average electricity generation costs in the U.S. 8% by 2030, with some regions seeing increases as high as 25%, according to the Open Energy Outlook Initiative.

More utilities are also shifting to “time-of-use” or “time-of-day” pricing, which sets higher electricity rates during peak hours, typically late afternoon and evening on weekdays.

A homeowner with solar panels and a battery back-up can draw from their stored energy – rather than the grid – during peak hours to save money, Schneider said.

These customers are also insulated from future energy rate hikes, said Corey Ziemann, solar program coordinator for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association.

“If you’re buying solar, you’re essentially buying all the energy you’re going to use from that system all at once. You’re locking in that rate so you won’t be subject to the increases that are coming,” Ziemann said.

The loss of the federal tax credit will likely stretch out the payback period for homeowners, Ziemann said. But another way to help make home solar more affordable is through “group buy” programs, which bring individuals from a community together to purchase in bulk.

The Midwest Renewable Energy Association’s Grow Solar team has facilitated more than 70 group buy programs in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri. An advisory committee made up of local stakeholders and officials review bids and vote on an installer to use.

Ziemann added that it’s cheaper for an installer to have crews working in a concentrated area.

“Typically, our group buys will be about 15%-18% below market rate, and then there can be additional discounts after that,” he said.

The association helped coordinate a group buy in eastern Iowa this fall, Ziemann said, which allowed over 30 homes and businesses in Jasper and Poweshiek counties to install solar.

Schneider with StraightUp Solar also sees potential with “Power Purchase Agreements” and lease programs, which he said his company and others have started to offer. Similar to leasing a car, Schneider said the homeowner uses the solar panels without owning them.

“You’re getting all the benefits from the utility. You’re getting the net metering; you’re getting the low utility bill because you’re getting solar energy directly to your house,” Schneider said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.",https://ipmnewsroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/solar_main.webp,N,,2025-12-16 08:59:21.509167

The Detroit-based automaker’s pivot away from large EVs and toward hybrids and extended-range EVs that come with a gas generator is proof that sustainable powertrains are easy on paper, but hard in reality.

Tesla is perhaps the biggest beneficiary of Ford’s decision, especially as it will no longer have to deal with the sole pure EV pickup that outsold it from time to time: the F-150 Lightning.

Here’s why:

Reduced Competition in the Electric Pickup Segment

The F-150 Lightning was the Tesla Cybertruck’s primary and direct rival in the full-size electric pickup market in the United States. With Ford’s decision to end pure EV production of its best-selling truck’s electric version and shifting to hybrids/EREVs, the Cybertruck faces significantly less competition.

This could drive more fleet and retail buyers toward the Cybertruck, especially those committed to fully electric vehicles without a gas generator backup.

Strengthened Market Leadership and Brand Perception in Pure EVs

Ford’s pullback from large EVs–citing unprofitability and lack of demand for EVs of that size–highlights the challenges legacy automakers face in scaling profitable battery-electric vehicles.

Tesla, as the established leader with efficient production and vertical integration, benefits from reinforced perception as the most viable and committed pure EV manufacturer.

This can boost consumer confidence in Tesla’s long-term ecosystem over competitors retreating to hybrids. With Ford making this move, it is totally reasonable that some car buyers could be reluctant to buy from other legacy automakers.

Profitability is a key reason companies build cars; they’re businesses, and they’re there to make money.

However, Ford’s new strategy could plant a seed in the head of some who plan to buy from companies like General Motors, Stellantis, or others, who could have second thoughts. With this backtrack in EVs, other things, like less education on these specific vehicles to technicians, could make repairs more costly and tougher to schedule.

Potential Increases in Market Share for Large EVs

Interestingly, this could play right into the hands of Tesla fans who have been asking for the company to make a larger EV, specifically a full-size SUV.

Customers seeking large, high-capability electric trucks or SUVs could now look to Tesla for its Cybertruck or potentially a future vehicle release, which the company has hinted at on several occasions this year.

With Ford reallocating resources away from large pure EVs and taking a $19.5 billion charge, Tesla stands to capture a larger slice of the remaining demand in this segment without a major U.S. competitor aggressively pursuing it.

Tesla’s domestic sales in China held steady in November with around 73,000 units delivered, but a closer look at the Model Y L’s numbers hints at an emerging shift towards pricier variants that could very well be boosting average selling prices and margins.

This suggests that the addition of the Model Y L to Tesla China’s lineup will not result in a case of cannibalization, but a possible case of “premiumization” instead.

Tesla China’s November domestic numbers

Data from the a Passenger Car Association (CPCA) indicated that Tesla China saw domestic deliveries of about 73,000 vehicles in November 2025. This number included 34,000 standard Model Y units, 26,000 Model 3 units, and 13,000 Model Y L units, as per industry watchers.

This means that the Model Y L accounted for roughly 27% of Tesla China’s total Model Y sales, despite the variant carrying a ~28% premium over the base RWD Model Y that is estimated to have dominated last year’s mix.

As per industry watcher @TSLAFanMtl, this suggests that Tesla China’s sales have moved towards more premium variants this year. Thus, direct year-over-year sales comparisons might miss the bigger picture. This is true even for the regular Model Y, as another premium trim, the Long Range RWD variant, was also added to the lineup this 2025.

November 2025 momentum

While Tesla China’s overall sales this year have seen challenges, the Model Y and Model 3 have remained strong sellers in the country. This is especially impressive as the Model Y and Model 3 are premium-priced vehicles, and they compete in the world’s most competitive electric vehicle market. Tesla China is also yet to roll out the latest capabilities of FSD in China, which means that its vehicles in the country could not tap into their latest capabilities yet.

Aggregated results from November suggest that the Tesla Model Y took the crown as China’s #1 best-selling SUV during the month, with roughly 34,000 deliveries. With the Model Y L, this number is even higher. The Tesla Model 3 also had a stellar month, seeing 25,700 deliveries during November 2025.

The Tesla Cybertruck has achieved the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s (IIHS) highest honor, earning a Top Safety Pick+ rating for 2025 models built after April 2025.

The full-size electric pickup truck’s safety rating is partly due to the vehicle’s strong performance in updated crash tests, superior front crash prevention, and effective headlights, among other factors. To commemorate the accolade, the official Cybertruck account celebrated the milestone on X.

Cybertruck’s IIHS rating

As per the IIHS, beginning with 2025 Cybertruck models built after April 2025, changes were made to the front underbody structure and footwell to improve occupant safety in driver-side and passenger-side small overlap front crashes. The moderate overlap front test earned a good rating, and the updated side impact test also received stellar marks.

The Cybertruck’s front crash prevention earned a good rating in pedestrian scenarios, with the standard Collision Avoidance Assist avoiding collisions in day and night tests across child, adult crossing, and parallel paths. Headlights with high-beam assist compensated for limitations, contributing to the top award.

Safest and most autonomous pickup

The Cybertruck is one of only two full-size pickups to receive the IIHS’ Top Safety Pick + rating. It is also the only one equipped with advanced self-driving features via Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) system. Thanks to FSD, the Cybertruck can navigate inner city streets and highways on its own with minimal supervision, adding a layer of safety beyond passive crash protection.

Community reactions poured in, with users praising the vehicle’s safety rating amidst skepticism from critics. Tesla itself highlighted this by starting its X post with a short clip of a Cybertruck critic who predicted that the vehicle will likely not pass safety tests. The only question now is, of course, if the vehicle’s Top Safety Pick+ rating from the IIHS will help the Cybertruck improve its sales.

Ford is canceling the all-electric F-150 Lightning and also announced it would take a $19.5 billion charge as it aims to quickly restructure its strategy regarding electrification efforts, a massive blow for the Detroit-based company that was once one of the most gung-ho on transitioning to EVs.

The announcement comes as the writing on the wall seemed to get bolder and more identifiable. Ford was bleeding money in EVs and, although it had a lot of success with the all-electric Lightning, it is aiming to push its efforts elsewhere.

It will also restructure its entire strategy on EVs, and the Lightning is not the only vehicle getting the boot. The T3 pickup, a long-awaited vehicle that was developed in part of a skunkworks program, is also no longer in the company’s plans.

Instead of continuing on with its large EVs, it will now shift its focus to hybrids and “extended-range EVs,” which will have an onboard gasoline engine to increase traveling distance, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs, and regulatory changes,” the company said in a statement.

While unfortunate, especially because the Lightning was a fantastic electric truck, Ford is ultimately a business, and a business needs to make money.

Ford has lost $13 billion on its EV business since 2023, and company executives are more than aware that they gave it plenty of time to flourish.

Andrew Frick, President of Ford, said:

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher returning areas, more trucks and van hybrids, extended range electric vehicles, affordable EVs, and entirely new opportunities like energy storage.”

CEO Jim Farley also commented on the decision:

“Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never make money, we are pivoting.”

Farley also said that the company now knows enough about the U.S. market “where we have a lot more certainty in this second inning.”",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/tesla-cybertruck-display-logo-1000x600.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:35.532618

Along with state and sector efforts, CAPs are a key component of Pennsylvania’s Chesapeake Bay Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan to reduce this pollution.","From Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection

On Friday, Dec. 12, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) awarded $17.7 million in 2026 Countywide Action Plan (CAP) Coordinator and Implementation Grants to county teams across Pennsylvania’s portion of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed to support the Commonwealth’s shared progress in reducing nutrient and sediment pollution to restore the health of local streams, rivers, and lakes.

The 2026 CAP Implementation Grant application round resulted in 222 approved projects that counties may complete over the next 12 to 24 months, resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 113,493 pounds/year of nitrogen, 28,816 pounds/year of phosphorus, and 11.8 million pounds/year of sediment delivered to the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania has reduced more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen in the past five years than in the previous 10 years, and water quality monitoring data show significant improvements in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment levels.

“Pennsylvania’s clean water successes are rooted in collaboration — state, local, federal, legislative, and non-governmental partners, and of course landowners,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “The work will continue to evolve, and our focus will remain on setting our collaborative partnerships up for success well beyond 2025. The momentum is real, and you can see it in our improved water quality.”

On Tuesday, Dec. 2, Governor Josh Shapiro was unanimously selected to serve a one-year term as chair of the Chesapeake Executive Council, marking the first time in 20 years that Pennsylvania has assumed leadership of the bipartisan body. The Chesapeake Executive Council is composed of the Governors of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting, the Chesapeake Executive Council also approved the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. The refreshed Watershed Agreement commits signatories to address nutrient and sediment goals and outcomes by 2040, with a midpoint assessment in 2033, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Program. Under the Shapiro Administration, Pennsylvania has accelerated progress toward its clean water goals by investing new financial resources, targeting high-performing pollution reduction strategies, implementing innovative technical solutions, listening to local leaders and stakeholders, and providing sustained support to implement county-based action plans.

The 2025 CAP Implementation Grants include $9.5 million from the state Environmental Stewardship Fund and $6.2 million in federal funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including $1.1 million in Local Government Implementation (LGI) Funds for project implementation in the Octoraro Watershed in Chester and Lancaster counties. The LGI projects will be reported to support pollution reduction goals under the multi-jurisdictional Conowingo Watershed Implementation Plan, which aims to reduce pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Conowingo Dam reservoir.

Through an innovative new arrangement, the block grant funding model of the CAP Implementation Grant has enabled DEP’s Bureau of Clean Water to provide $100,000 of 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds to Mifflin County in support of restoration of the Town Run Watershed and $114,000 of federal Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant funding through the Bureau of Watershed Restoration and Nonpoint Source Management for restoration efforts in the Hammer Creek Watershed. This is the first time the 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds have been targeted through a partnership between DEP programs toward the Countywide Action Plans.

Along with state and sector efforts, CAPs are a key component of Pennsylvania’s Chesapeake Bay Phase 3 Watershed Implementation Plan to reduce this pollution. All 34 counties that were asked to develop a CAP are currently engaged in implementing their CAPs.

The Phase 3 WIP takes a Healthy Waters, Healthy Communities approach, inviting county teams to take control of local water quality improvement, with state and other partners providing as much data, technical assistance, funding, and other support as possible. It encourages and equips counties to develop strategies and determine project sites and types that will benefit their communities and farmers, municipalities, businesses, and other landowners, while restoring the environment.

Countywide action teams have implemented a diverse range of projects and initiatives in the Chesapeake Bay watershed since 2021, including not only stream restorations, streambank tree plantings, rain gardens, and livestock crossing installations, but also a rapid stream delisting strategy, which aims to delist pollution-impaired streams from Pennsylvania’s list of agriculturally-impaired waterways by the year 2030.

What Comes Next The surge in megaproject construction is expected to continue shaping industry trends through 2026 and beyond, particularly in data centers, semiconductor manufacturing and energy export facilities.","A new wave of massive construction investments totaling hundreds of billions of dollars is preparing to break ground across the United States in 2026, signaling continued momentum in megaproject development even as broader construction markets face headwinds.

At least 10 projects valued at more than $1 billion each are scheduled to begin construction next year, spanning advanced manufacturing, energy production, transportation infrastructure and digital development. These large-scale ventures are expected to generate thousands of jobs while reinforcing U.S. competitiveness in strategically important industries.

As traditional commercial and residential construction shows signs of strain, megaprojects—defined as developments typically costing $1 billion or more—are increasingly serving as critical growth drivers. However, they also underscore ongoing challenges related to labor shortages, supply-chain constraints and shifting industrial priorities.

Recent data from the Dodge Construction Network (DCN) shows that investment growth remains heavily concentrated in a limited number of sectors, even as activity in others remains sluggish. These projects reflect a blend of federal, state and private investment and point to long-term bets on domestic manufacturing, clean energy and digital infrastructure.

Major Megaprojects Starting in 2026

Among the most significant developments is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s $165 billion investment in Arizona, which includes three advanced fabrication plants and a research and development center. The initiative is designed to strengthen domestic chip production and support next-generation semiconductor technologies.

In Texas, GlobalWafers plans to invest $7.5 billion to build the nation’s first 300mm silicon wafer manufacturing facility, aimed at securing a domestic supply of materials critical for advanced chip production used in artificial intelligence, electric vehicles and 5G technologies.

Arizona will also host a $5.5 billion manufacturing complex from LG Energy Solution focused on electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems, supporting the expanding EV and renewable energy markets.

Louisiana is set to see multiple large-scale investments, including a $5.8 billion ultra-low-carbon steel manufacturing plant using Electric Arc Furnace technology, as well as a $15.1 billion liquefied natural gas export terminal and pipeline project designed to expand U.S. energy exports.

In Tennessee, the multibillion-dollar Kingston Energy Complex will combine natural gas generation, battery storage and solar power, marking the retirement of nine coal-fired units and a major shift in regional energy infrastructure.

Transportation infrastructure will also see major investment, led by Brightline West’s more than $21 billion high-speed rail project connecting Las Vegas and Southern California. The rail line is expected to remove millions of cars from Interstate 15 each year while reducing congestion and emissions.

Maryland’s Northeast Corridor will benefit from a $5.9 billion modernization of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel, expanding capacity and improving reliability for millions of Amtrak passengers through new tracks, signaling and ventilation systems.

Digital infrastructure remains a dominant driver of megaproject growth. Meta is investing $7.5 billion in the Hyperion Data Centre in Louisiana, a multi-building campus spanning more than 1.4 million square feet. Amazon is also planning a $15 billion data center expansion in Indiana, which is expected to create more than 1,000 construction jobs and hundreds of permanent technology positions.

Industry Perspective

Sarah Martin, associate director of forecasting at DCN, said: ""Much of the momentum we’re seeing is still concentrated in big-ticket, high-tech projects. Outside those categories, the pace of expansion is noticeably steadier and more restrained.""

She added: ""Growth in construction starts continued to be propped up by high-value megaproject activity last month. Outside of these high-tech buildings, however, growth appears more moderate. In square footage terms, for example, nonresidential and residential starts declined by 4.3 percent over the month, and are down 5.4 percent year-to-date through October.""

Douglas Schrift, global head of infrastructure at Liberty Mutual, highlighted how rapidly the market has evolved, saying: ""Just three or four years ago, billion-dollar projects were rare. Now we see multiple projects of that size every month, and they continue to grow.""

What Comes Next

The surge in megaproject construction is expected to continue shaping industry trends through 2026 and beyond, particularly in data centers, semiconductor manufacturing and energy export facilities. However, experts caution that this growth remains uneven, with broader commercial, healthcare, education and smaller institutional projects lagging behind.

Long-term success for these developments will depend on the construction industry’s ability to address skilled labor shortages, manage supply-chain logistics and mitigate environmental impacts associated with large-scale builds.",,N,,2025-12-16 09:00:19.067458

According to the think tank, such measures disproportionately benefit households and companies with high energy consumption and higher incomes.

Most CTF spending is directed toward programmes without a clear social focus or into broad-based relief measures that tend to benefit higher-income households and businesses, the institute said in its review of budget plans for 2025 and 2026.

Socially targeted measures – such as income-tiered building renovation schemes, household energy-efficiency advice or the government's planned electric vehicle subsidy for low- and middle-income households – account for just 14 percent of expenditure, the analysis found.

The report also points to a shift in spending priorities in 2026 towards short-term energy price relief, while the share of investment spending is set to decline sharply and then stagnate. According to the think tank, such measures disproportionately benefit households and companies with high energy consumption and higher incomes.

The CTF is a central financing tool for Germany's efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions and reach climate neutrality by 2045. It is funded primarily through revenues from Germany's national carbon price on transport and heating, proceeds from the sale of EU emissions allowances under the Emissions Trading System (ETS), and transfers from a debt-financed 500-billion-euro fund for infrastructure and climate neutrality.

A recent analysis by the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) of 2024 data found that poorer households are proportionally more burdened by Germany's national carbon price on transport and heating, even though they cause considerably fewer emissions than more affluent groups in society.

Zukunft KlimaSozial said a socially balanced design of the fund was essential, noting that low- and middle-income households are particularly sensitive to rising energy and living costs.

At least initially here, I see the stock popping about a one and a half percent here in the after hours. What is your immediate response and reaction to that news, Garrett?

Sure, thanks for having me. I think the only thing that's really surprising is the magnitude. The 19.5 billion is is larger than we would expect. Um, I think uh it was a 8 billion of that was was related to EVs. I don't think it's a surprise. I think most investors have anticipated this. So I do agree with the uh takeaway. It's sort of a rip the band off bandaid off moment. Um, we saw General Motors take a uh charge of 1.6 billion back in October related to their EV assets. And really, it this became inevitable as soon as the federal EV tax credit uh went away at the end of September. Um, you know, EV companies looking at, um, you know, taking impairment charges related to their EV assets. And, um, overall, I think what we're what we've seen in the market is is all positive for Ford. Their US vehicle lineup is entirely comprised of trucks and SUVs at this point, aside from the Ford Mustang. So that's the only model they still produce that's not a truck or SUV. Um so they benefit from lower uh oil, lower oil and gas prices and uh declining interest rates. So they're they're really the big winner, and they didn't make as much of a bet on EVs as General Motors did. They took more of a balanced approach between EV, hybrid and uh internal combustion engine vehicle. And and Ford has done very well with their with their hybrids. So there's a lot of reason for optimism when looking at some of the hybrid models they have.

So reasons for optimism, but but Garrett, you still have a hold on this name, correct? Why, why are you still on the sidelines, Garrett?

Yeah, the stock's had a big rally in recent months and we think the risk reward is is pretty balanced here. Um, that said, you know, our 12-month price target is $15. It does imply some upside here. Uh, you have a nice dividend yield, um, for the for the stock. Um, we just like, uh, you know, some other names better. We like GM better, uh here. We we think they have a more favorable risk reward.

The awarded projects include roadways, water and wastewater systems, stormwater management, and utilities, according to IFA, which administers the program.

“Increasing Indiana’s housing supply is essential to supporting our growing workforce and strengthening local economies,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a news release.

“These investments will help communities keep pace with job growth, attract new talent, and ensure more Hoosier families have access to safe, affordable places to live,” he said. “When we expand housing opportunities, we’re laying the foundation for long-term economic success in every corner of our state.”

The awardees are:

Elkhart: $10 million

St. Joseph and New Carlisle: $4.5 million

Arcadia: $3 million

Austin: $1 million

Attica: $975,000

Texas has attracted a significant number of data and AI centers, second only to Virginia.
However, the Solar Energy Industries Association has concerns.
Fortunately, and according to Cleanview’s project tracker in November, politics are not slowing down renewable energy projects.
Hopefully, this could mitigate forecast energy cost increases over time.","Google’s announcement last month that it plans to construct three new data centers in Texas at a cost of $40 billion is the latest in a series of new projects proposed over the next few years.

At the present time, there are 375 data centers already operating in Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio, with another 70 currently under construction, according to research and advisory firm Baxtel.

Texas has attracted a significant number of data and AI centers, second only to Virginia. The state offers relatively cheap energy, great expanses of land and a business-friendly economic environment.

However, these facilities are power hungry. This either places more pressure on electrical grids already burdened with regular demand or means the centers themselves need to come up with their own power plan. That’s what Google intends to do.

“Google is committed to responsibly growing its infrastructure by bringing new energy resources onto the grid, paying for costs associated with its operations, and supporting community energy efficiency initiatives,” the company said. “In Texas, this includes a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to scale and accelerate energy initiatives, along with more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity contracted to date through power purchase agreements with energy developers.”

However, it’s not clear whether all the new data centers and AI facilities planned for Texas will be self-powering. Some may be hybrids like the Stargate project near Abilene, which will draw power from its own natural gas generator as well as from the grid.

In September 2024, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the independent, non-profit organization that operates most of the state’s electric grid, was reportedly tracking 56 gigawatts in large load interconnection requests. That number almost quadrupled to 205 gigawatts one year later.

Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT’s vice-president of system planning and weatherization, told a Public Utility Commission of Texas meeting in October the increased volume of the energy demand from large data centers, particularly those serving artificial intelligence, will require an adjustment of the planning processes to keep the grid reliable.

The demand increase is likely to cause concern among traditional Texas consumers. Summer heat results in peak power demands. Back in July, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said electricity prices for Texas residential customers and businesses were 24 per cent below the national average. In the current environment of data center growth, the cost of electricity is almost certain to increase significantly.

“The sharpest jump will occur in the ERCOT-North hub in Texas, where prices are forecast to surge 45 per cent due to high summer demand paired with limited supply,” writes Brien Sheahan, former chairman and CEO of the Illinois Commerce Commission. “While natural gas prices remain a major driver of power costs, the EIA notes that Texas’ 2026 increases reflect large hourly price spikes.”

The state needs to pull out all the stops in order to meet future forecast demands and renewable energy sources appear to be doing the job.

Sean Kelly, co-founder and CEO of energy forecasting company Amperon, writes over the last four years, ERCOT’s solar capacity had increased by more than 200 per cent. One reason is that renewables such as wind and solar can come online far faster than traditional natural gas power plants. Kelly also notes since solar has no fuel costs, it operates at a low marginal cost, thus pushing market prices down.

However, the Solar Energy Industries Association has concerns. It says the Donald Trump administration “is using every tool at its disposal to slow down solar and storage projects,” and that “under Washington’s new energy permitting bureaucracy, projects large and small are being trapped in limbo.”

It estimates Texas alone accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the at-risk projects. Further data suggests due to insufficient transmission capability, eight TWh of solar and wind power in Texas was curtailed in 2024.

Fortunately, and according to Cleanview’s project tracker in November, politics are not slowing down renewable energy projects. There were 877 solar projects alone under development in Texas. In fact, as of August, ERCOT reported five times the number of solar and wind interconnection requests versus natural gas.

“Combined, wind and solar can now supply up to nearly half of ERCOT’s total electricity demand, which makes the market less reactive to increases in the cost of natural gas,” Kelly continues.

Renewables and accompanying battery storage also help to stabilize supply during peak periods or disruptions of fuel supplies to traditional power plants.

Hopefully, this could mitigate forecast energy cost increases over time. The continued growth of renewables in Texas is the best outcome for all concerned. As Kelly warns, if supply is pinched and electricity costs do in fact increase as much as some are forecasting, those data centers won’t be coming to Texas at all, unless they find the added investment capital to somehow power themselves.

Kelly’s conclusion is compelling.

“The highly politicized national energy debates are missing the point. It’s not about ideology; it’s about doing what works. And what works in Texas is competition, consumer choice and resources that prove their worth economically. If we continue to let data — not dogma — drive energy decisions here, Texas will be fine, and we might just show the rest of the country a thing or two in the process.”",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/12/Stargate-Abilene-Open-AI-StargateMainWEB-US.png,N,,2025-12-16 07:57:32.681469

The US car giant cut back electric vehicle (EV) production, including the production of large battery-powered pickup trucks, because of a slump in demand from drivers.

Ford said “lower than expected” uptake of EVs had resulted in billions in losses.

Instead, the Detroit carmaker will plough more into building conventional trucks and vans and cheaper EVs, as well as launching a new battery energy storage business.

The $19.5bn writedown, announced to Wall Street on Monday, is one of the largest financial hits suffered by a carmaker to date as bets on EVs turn sour in the face of plummeting demand.

Ford’s writedown includes $6bn to close a joint venture with South Korean company SK Group. The duo had planned to build a massive battery factory in Kentucky to propel Ford’s EV vision but the plan has now been scrapped.

Jim Farley, Ford’s chief executive, said: “This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford.

“The operating reality has changed and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities”

The move comes amid a major regulatory shift after Donald Trump, the US president, weakened rules on carmakers to cut emissions.

Mr Trump has also ended $7,500 tax credits for drivers who buy EVs, suppressing demand across the US.

He has claimed without citing evidence that pro-EV policies brought in by Joe Biden, his Democratic predecessor, have driven up costs and prices while making cars “much worse”.

Ford said the majority of changes will take place in the fourth quarter, with a payment of about $5.5bn in cash to be paid mostly next year and the remainder being covered in 2027.

The company said it will continue to produce smaller, more affordable EVs instead of larger models.

Despite the move, Ford said it was raising its guidance for earnings this year to about $7bn, which is in line with a target set earlier in the year.

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, the head of Ford’s EV unit.

Still, the carmaker foresees about 50pc of its global volume to be in hybrid vehicles, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles by 2030 – up from 17pc this year.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/12/16/TELEMMGLPICT000453641356_17658770425760_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq5PHEjWUEYlSXIGf8T4kkZJwQOpIpveak-x4Rpo0__g8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:46.686591

If your eyes glaze over at the mention of the proposed zoning changes in Detroit, you are not alone.

Residents who have tried to make sense of the proposed changes have said they find them confusing, with too many being put forward at the same time. Even the Detroit City Council has struggled. The proposals hit councilmembers’ desks back in November, and that’s where they remain despite having top billing during an eight-hour-long end-of-year session.

Here’s the one-sentence summary: The changes would update zoning in residential neighborhoods to allow more types of development and make it easier to redevelop civic buildings.

Here’s the longer version: The “tactical preservation” proposal removes barriers to redeveloping civic buildings like libraries, fire stations and schools, allowing for them to be adapted into uses like child care centers and laundromats.

The “let’s build more housing” proposal would allow for more types of housing and make it easier to develop, so most neighborhoods can build units like “granny flats” or “backyard bungalows.”

City Council said it would dive back into the ordinances in January. As always, we’ll keep you updated. And if you have any questions, email kiran@outliermedia.org.

Detroit’s new zoning changes, explained

A new batch of proposals that would update Detroit zoning laws have caused some confusion. Here’s what to know.

🌡️ Faulty towers: City officials say a temporary boiler is up and running at Alden Towers. Parts of the riverfront apartment complex have had heat problems all season. The property has racked up more than $8,000 in blight tickets in the past three weeks. A spokesperson for Detroit’s Buildings, Safety, Engineering and Environmental Department said it’s inspecting temperatures, but tenants should report persistent problems by using the city’s website. (Metro Times, City of Detroit)

💔 Rebuilding again: Hitha Healing House, a maternal health nonprofit in Grixdale Farms, is now closed after a house fire. The healing house branded itself as a community hub for Black maternal health and wellness, offering classes on childbirth, meditation, massage and more. No one was injured in the fire or living in the house at the time. The owner is looking to raise money to support reconstruction of the space, which provides employment for 12 practitioners. (BridgeDetroit)

🗣️ Emily’s a big talker: Detroit’s Department of Neighborhoods is testing an artificial intelligence customer service agent in Districts 3 and 4, with the goal of answering questions about basic neighborhood services. But “Emily” is apparently more than a bit confused about whom it’s serving and why.

Outlier called the number listed for District 4 manager Nicholas Barnes and spoke with the AI agent for seven minutes. We asked, “When is the last day for curbside pickup of yard waste?”, and, “How often does my street get salted?” Emily’s answer for both questions: Contact the Department of Public Works, which handles such matters. The bot said the staff there would know the answer, but it didn’t know their phone number. Instead, it referred us to the city’s well-known detroitmi.gov where we could find it for ourselves.

When asked what kinds of questions she could answer, Emily said it could connect us with District 3 events and resources, or take reports of blight and other issues to file with the appropriate department. After clarifying that we called District 4, the agent admitted it’s only programmed to be in-the-know about District 3 and said there must be a routing error with the District 4 phone number — which it would report. Though fun and friendly, the conversation was not exactly helpful. We want to know so much more, like who folks in D4 should call now that Emily is answering the phones.

Fifty years ago, Detroit approved another water rate hike

by Michael Jackman

In 1975, rising costs convinced the Detroit Metropolitan Water Department to support a 39% increase in water rates for Detroiters and residents of 95 suburbs. The measure would raise typical Detroit water bills from $5.16 per quarter to $7.17 per quarter starting May 1. This came after a sewage rate hike took effect Sept. 1, tripling Detroiters’ sewerage bills, with varying hikes hitting suburbanites. The Detroit Free Press reported the water hike could raise Detroiters’ combined water and sewage bills as high as almost $49.56 a year. (That’s approximately $300 in 2025 dollars. Recently, a typical monthly Detroit water and sewerage bill for a family of four was about $112 per month, or about $1,340 a year.)

The company plans to use its EV battery manufacturing capacity in the country for large-scale energy storage systems to power data centers.

The automaker plans to convert its Glendale, Kentucky, facility to produce large-scale energy storage systems, creating a new revenue stream alongside vehicle manufacturing.

The battery storage systems will start shipping in 2027, and Ford plans to build 20GWh of annual capacity in this initiative. The company plans to inject roughly $2 billion to scale this business in the upcoming two years.

What’s in the plan?

According to the official source, the US automaker will convert its Kentucky site to build advanced battery energy storage systems larger than five megawatt-hours. This initiative includes the kind of hardware used by data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial companies – LFP prismatic cells, BESS modules, and 20-foot DC container systems.

Ford will aim to bring the initial production online within 18 months, leaning on its manufacturing experience and licensed battery technology.

The move follows a joint venture disposition agreement reached last week between Ford, SK On, SK Battery America, and BlueOval SK. Under the agreement, a Ford subsidiary will independently own and operate the Kentucky battery plants, while SK On will fully own and operate the Tennessee battery plant.

A new opportunity

Lisa Drake, Vice President of technology platform programs and EV systems at Ford, revealed how commercial grid customers will be a new opportunity for the new business. However, data centers will be secondary, and Ford will probably offer some home storage products.

“It was clear when we went out to the market that the technology of choice for most of these customers was an LFP prismatic type of container system,” Drake said.

“And given the fact that we already had a license to build that technology in the U.S., you couple that with our manufacturing experience over a century of high-scale manufacturing, it just made a lot of sense as a natural adjacency for us,” she continued.

A holistic strategy

Separately, the company will use its BlueOval Battery Park, Michigan, facility to produce smaller cells for residential energy storage and an upcoming midsize electric truck starting in 2026.

However, there will be one change at the Michigan factory, Ford revealed. The site will also produce smaller Amp-hour cells for residential energy storage, indicating the strategy will extend beyond commercial customers.

BlueOval Battery Park Michigan has seen multiple changes since it was announced. In February 2023, Ford pledged a $3.5 billion investment to build the plant to produce LFP batteries for its expanding electric vehicle lineup.

Construction was paused in September 2023, and two months later, Ford revealed a scaled-down plan, reducing the facility’s capacity to 20 gigawatt-hours, about 43 percent less than originally planned.",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ford-headquarters.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 08:58:33.270277

Deep winter greenhouses (DWGs) and geodesic dome greenhouses (GDGs) are promising systems for extending the growing season and supporting local food production in cold northern areas. Both systems use low-energy, passive designs to reduce heating needs while maintaining suitable growing conditions for crops.

Deep winter greenhouses fit the bill for frigid Midwestern winters

The Deep Winter Greenhouse (DWG) design, developed by University of Minnesota Extension (https://tinyurl.com/24v5jcep), features an insulated structure with a south-facing glazing wall at a 60° angle to efficiently capture sunlight, even on the shortest days of winter. Daytime heat is stored by funneling warm greenhouse air through a thermal mass of rock under the structure. At night, the rock gradually releases heat to maintain stable greenhouse temperatures, eliminating the need for supplemental winter heating.

As DWGs have been operating successfully across Minnesota, we recently tested how the DWG design would perform under Wisconsin conditions using computer simulations. In winter, average air temperatures are about 17 °F in Minnesota (Cook County) and 23 °F in Wisconsin (Grant County). Although outdoor temperatures often fall below freezing, soil temperatures at a depth of 40 inches, where the rock bed is located, remain above freezing (36.9 °F in Minnesota and 39.6 °F in Wisconsin).

Since both states receive similar levels of solar radiation during winter, DWGs have strong potential for crop production during Wisconsin’s cold winters. In summer, well-insulated DWG structures trap excessive heat, leading to interior temperatures over 95 °F. Ventilation fans are needed to remove hot air to maintain a suitable summer growing environment. Solar-powered ventilation systems provide renewable energy options for ventilation and air movement in DWGs.

Design of geodesic dome greenhouses offers many benefits

Geodesic dome greenhouses (GDGs) offer another design option. A dome’s aerodynamic, spherical shape minimizes heat loss and maximizes wind tolerance, while providing uniform light distribution. An important feature of geodesic dome greenhouses is an above-ground pond for heat storage. The design takes advantage of seasonal variation in the sun’s angle.

During winter, low-angle sunlight falls on the insulated north wall, reflecting light toward the pond and warming it up. The pond’s stored heat is gradually released at night, warming the greenhouse. In summer, when the sun is higher in the sky, the north wall remains shaded, preventing excessive warming.

In addition to the pond, the system also uses a fan to draw air from the pond area through pipes buried under raised beds along the greenhouse perimeter. This circulation pathway transfers stored heat into the soil, promoting stable root-zone conditions during colder periods. In summary, although GDGs do not eliminate heating needs entirely, they provide a substantial reduction during winter and contribute to more stable energy use throughout the year.

But now it’s clear that the AI-fueled tech industry boom is poised to push our electrical grid to the brink.

The question is: Will Pennsylvania keep its place as America’s energy leader? Or will we fall behind our neighboring states and leave consumers stuck with sky-high electric bills in the process?

Pennsylvania is already starting to lose its grip as the region’s leading power player. Our neighboring states are making moves that could position them ahead of us – especially in nuclear energy.

Now that Pennsylvania is officially out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), there can be no more excuses for sitting on the sidelines of the new nuclear energy production surge.

To be sure, there are some exciting developments in Pennsylvania nuclear news.

Three Mile Island Unit 1 is gearing up to restart under the new name of Crane Clean Energy Center – ironically getting new life entirely because of the AI boom, as Microsoft has an exclusive deal to purchase the more than 800 megawatts of electricity that the plant will generate and add to the regional power grid.

But traditional nuclear power plants are a part of the energy puzzle. Pennsylvania needs to add new capacity to the electric grid, and that means fostering investment in exciting new clean energy sources – from advanced nuclear, such as small modular reactors (SMR) to geothermal and carbon-capture technologies.

The Pennsylvania House of Representatives recently took a great first step when it passed legislation to reduce fees for SMRs, to align those fees with the size of SMR projects and make them more financially feasible to develop across the commonwealth.

Why SMRs? To put it simply, they are smaller, safer, more flexible and faster to build than traditional nuclear reactors – at a fraction of the upfront costs.

Other states are already betting big on new nuclear – both SMRs and advanced versions of large reactors – to help address surging electricity demand and spiking prices. New York has a goal of adding 1 gigawatt of clean energy to the grid through advanced nuclear, while Maryland is working on nuclear production incentives.

Pennsylvania needs new energy sources, but our laws and regulations are simply not keeping up with today’s technologies.

As an example, Pennsylvania’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards (AEPS) are woefully outdated. The AEPS is meant to boost the total supply of energy generation by requiring electricity suppliers to generate their electricity from a broad array of sources – including clean energy sources.

But missing from the AEPS list is nuclear power – both traditional and advanced reactors – a major clean energy source that will be needed to boost grid capacity.

Also missing: carbon capture. If carbon capture was added to Pennsylvania’s AEPS, natural gas producers would be incentivized to add it to their projects, resulting in cleaner wells and a new, clean energy source.

Adding to Pennsylvania’s energy crunch is the glacially slow pace at which new energy production sources are added to the grid. That’s due in part to the red tape involved with getting large-scale energy projects approved. We need energy siting reform to streamline the permitting process and get more energy projects approved and online as fast as possible.

Pennsylvania consumers and businesses are already feeling the pinch of rising electricity rates, and we know prices are expected to keep going up at an alarming rate.

For years, our elected leaders in Harrisburg have pointed to the political debate and ensuing legal battle over RGGI as the reason why Pennsylvania couldn’t move forward with a real strategy for boosting energy production. Well, RGGI is gone. So now what?

We are well past time for Pennsylvania to have a robust and nation-leading energy strategy that will compete not just with our neighboring states but with other nations around the globe.

The roadmap is there. Now we just need our elected leaders in Harrisburg to take the wheel, put their foot on the pedal, and drive us to energy dominance.

The proposal currently is open for public comment.

Some environmental advocates say they’re concerned fast-tracking these permits for data centers will leave out reviews that ensure public health and safety. The Ohio EPA says the move is necessary to accommodate important social and economic development.

Ohio EPA issues draft general permit for data centers

Ohio has more than 200 data centers, according to Data Center Map. They are warehouses filled with computer equipment that generates a lot of heat. To cool down the computers, data centers use massive amounts of water.

If data centers want to get rid of that water after it’s been used, they have to apply for a permit called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) through the Ohio EPA. University of Cincinnati College of Law Professor Brad Mank says the permits regulate and limit the amount of pollution any manufacturer can discharge into waters like the Ohio River.

Currently, data centers must apply for an individual NPDES permit, which is detailed and unique to its operations.

That could soon change. The Ohio EPA has issued a draft general NPDES permit for wastewater and stormwater discharges from data centers, which covers facilities with similar operations and types of discharge.

In an emailed statement, the Ohio EPA said it aims “to provide a streamlined permit application and approval process for sites that are generally consistent in their potential discharges and environmental impact.”

Several other types of businesses are regulated through general permits, such as dry cleaners.

An expedited permitting process

Mank, the UC Law professor, says applying for a general permit is designed to be an expedited process.

“General permits make it a lot easier for industry to operate without many restrictions — they basically have uniform restrictions that apply to everybody,” Mank said. “So, they can basically send a postcard saying, ‘We're operating our business,’ and that's all they have to do.”

Under the general permit, eligible data centers would have to submit a notice of intent form before discharging pollutants like heavy metals and corrosion inhibitors into waterways. Several discharges associated with data centers would not be authorized by the general permit, like discharges located within 500 yards upstream of a public water supply surface water intake.

Mank says having a simplified permitting process could draw more data center developers to Ohio over other states.

“We'd be seen as one of the states that's making it easier for data centers to operate, because one of the big things they need to do is use lots of water,” Mank said. “So, if it's relatively easy to use the water without a lot of restrictions, that would mean, if I'm thinking about where I'm siting a data center, Ohio would be included on my list of states that are data center friendly.”

In an emailed statement, the Ohio EPA said, “The general permit includes the same or more monitoring and reporting requirements compared to an individual NPDES permit.”

Data center developers already are incentivized to build in Ohio by state and local tax breaks.

Environmental advocates raise concerns

Some environmental advocates are voicing concerns over the proposed change.

Save Ohio Parks, an organization advocating for the end of fracking on public land, says it is worried water quality would suffer.

The Ohio EPA wrote in its draft general permit, “It has been determined that a lowering of water quality of various waters of the state associated with granting coverage under this permit is necessary to accommodate important social and economic development in the state of Ohio.”

In a blog post published Dec. 14, Save Ohio Parks wrote, “General permits are intended for situations of minimal environmental impact. Yet this general permit says up front that it will result in lower water quality. That’s not acceptable!”

The organization also says it’s concerned that the general permit does not consider the variety of sizes, designs and locations of data centers, and that it does not mention forever chemicals, also known as PFAS, which data centers often use in their cooling systems.

The agency says the draft permit will be issued as a final action unless the director revises it after considering the record of a public hearing or written comments, or upon disapproval by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA.

How to weigh in

The draft wastewater general permit for data centers is currently open for comment. You can submit a written comment via the Ohio EPA’s online comment portal through Dec. 17.

The Ohio EPA also is holding a public hearing Dec. 17 at 2:30 p.m. both virtually and in-person in Columbus at the Lazarus Government Center, 6th Floor Conference Room A (Autumn Room), 50 West Town Street, Suite 700.

The Detroit automaker said it will cancel plans for select larger EVs — including its F-150 Lightning — due to weak demand, elevated costs and regulatory changes, marking a significant shift in strategy as the industry grapples with slower-than-expected electric vehicle adoption.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” CEO Jim Farley said.

“The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.”

The shift by Ford comes just days after President Donald Trump moved to revoke tougher fuel-economy standards put in place by his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, which had prompted US companies to embrace a transition to electric vehicles.

Farley at the time praised Trump for “aligning fuel economy standards with market realities,” calling it “a win for customers and common sense.”

Trump has railed against what he calls an EV “mandate,” while Republicans in Congress have repealed clean-energy tax credits that had also stoked demand for EVs.

Remaining EV efforts at Ford will now concentrate on a family of smaller, affordable electric vehicles, instead of higher-cost larger vehicles.

Ford said it had halted production of the current F-150 Lightning electric pickup, which it once hoped would spearhead a transition to EVs.

Instead, the next-generation Lightning will be hybrid, combining battery power with a gasoline engine, offering an estimated 700-plus mile range, the company said.

Ford also canceled plans for new electric commercial vans in Europe and North America, replacing them with gas and hybrid models to be manufactured at its Ohio assembly plant starting in 2029.

In the shift, the company will repurpose its Tennessee facility, renaming the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center to Tennessee Truck Plant, to build new affordable gas-powered trucks beginning in 2029 instead of electric vehicles.

Ford said it was also launching a battery energy storage business, converting a Kentucky plant to manufacture products for data centers and power companies.

Most of the $19.5 billion charge will be recorded in 2025 and 2026, with $5.5 billion in cash effects extending into 2027. Ford said about $8.5 billion is tied to canceled EV programs, $6 billion to ending a battery joint venture with South Korea's SK On and roughly $5 billion to program-related expenses.

For Context: Ford's EV division has lost more than $12 billion since 2023 as sales slowed and costs rose. The shift comes as other automakers also rethink EV plans following softer consumer demand and changes in US policy, including the expiration of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and looser emissions enforcement. Ford executives said the strategy reflects a ""customer-driven shift"" toward higher-return products, as the broader auto industry adjusts to a slower transition to fully electric vehicles.

How the Media Covered It: Outlets across the political spectrum noted the impact of President Trump's policies on the EV industry. New York Post (Lean Right bias) and Newsmax (Right) both emphasized the amount of money Ford invested in EVs and quoted a Ford executive saying, ""Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas."" Newsmax said the move ""underscores growing skepticism"" from the auto industry about EV profitability. Many outlets on the Left and in the Center, including, heavily cited Ford's reasoning behind the move and positives of the new strategy. Many included Ford CEO's quote that it was a ""customer-driven shift"" and ""positive for jobs"". Bloomberg (Lean Left) noted the move is a ""testament"" to the difficulty Ford's faced making EVs profitable and argued Trump's policy changes are likely to worsen those challenges. Wall Street Journal (Center) mentioned previous EV policy from the Biden administration and pushback from Republicans. It said the move is ""a fresh sign"" that America's roadways will continue to have a large number of gas-powered cars. The Verge (Lean Left) and Forbes (Center) both mentioned long-term difficulties selling EVs.",https://img.allsides.com/sites/default/files/screenshot-2025-12-15-204808.png,N,,2025-12-16 11:07:50.278871

With fossil fuel demand expected to peak between 2030 and 2035, the state faces potential challenges to revenues and employment linked to its mining-dependent economy.

The report sets out a framework for Green Economic Diversification, identifying pathways to leverage Jharkhand’s existing industrial base while reducing long-term fiscal and workforce vulnerabilities. It focuses on four high-potential sectors: Clean Power, Green Molecules, Sustainable Mobility, and Green Equipment Manufacturing. Together, these sectors could generate an estimated USD 1.43 billion in annual state tax revenue, helping impact future in fossil fuel–related income.

Delivering this transition will require an estimated USD 41.4 billion in cumulative investment. The roadmap proposes a phased strategy, beginning with an Enabling Phase (2026–2035) that prioritises reinvestment of current fossil fuel revenues into infrastructure development, workforce reskilling, and a dedicated transition finance framework. Subsequent phases focus on scaling new industries and sustaining long-term economic resilience.

Investment Opportunity by Sector

The roadmap estimates a total cumulative investment requirement of USD 41.4 billion (INR 351,900 crore) to anchor new green industries in Jharkhand:

Green Molecules Production – USD 21.8 billion (INR 185,300 crore)

Investments in bioethanol, compressed biogas, and green hydrogen/ammonia production.

Sustainable Mobility and Components – USD 14.3 billion (INR 121,550 crore)

Manufacturing of electric vehicles (two-wheelers, cars, and commercial vehicles) and hydrogen-based internal combustion engine heavy commercial vehicles.

Green Equipment Manufacturing – USD 5.3 billion (INR 45,050 crore)

Integrated manufacturing hubs for solar PV cells and modules, and lithium-ion battery cells and packs.

Key Takeaways

Revenue substitution: Emerging green sectors could generate approximately USD 1.43 billion in annual state tax revenue, helping replace declining mining-related revenues.

Employment potential: Green manufacturing and MSME growth could create a net-positive employment outcome, exceeding job losses in the fossil fuel sector.

Capital mobilisation: Achieving this transition requires USD 41.4 billion in cumulative investment across power, mobility, and manufacturing.

Phased implementation: The roadmap follows a three-stage pathway—Enabling (2026–2035), Scaling Up (2036–2047), and Viksit Bharat (2048–2070)—to support a just, resilient, and future-ready economy for Jharkhand.",https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1415368447.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 08:59:31.110132

Why it matters: The gap exposes how far behind American automakers have fallen in the EV race they once claimed to lead.

The Details

The top three EV sellers globally (BYD, Geely, and Tesla) together control nearly 40% of the market, while all three Detroit automakers combined hold less than 5%.

Ford’s EV division has lost approximately $13 billion since 2021 and expects to record $19.5 billion in charges in Q4 2025, mostly tied to its struggling electric vehicle business.

BloombergNEF estimates 24% fewer EVs will be sold in the U.S. in Q4 2025 compared to the prior year, following the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit.

Chinese EV-focused brands launch a new model every 1.8 years compared to 5.2 years for non-Chinese brands like Tesla, according to AlixPartners.

Ford is developing a cheaper electric pickup targeting $30,000 with a 2027 launch date, using 20% fewer parts to compete with Chinese rivals.

Global EV Market Share (Q1-Q3 2025)

BYD: Approximately 22%

Geely: Approximately 10%

Tesla: Approximately 9%

Volkswagen: Approximately 7%

Chery Automobile: Approximately 5%

Stellantis: Less than 3%

General Motors: Less than 2%

Ford Motor: Less than 2%

EVXL’s Take

The Wall Street Journal’s analysis confirms what EVXL has documented for over a year: Detroit bet on expensive electric trucks and SUVs that required $7,500 in taxpayer subsidies to find buyers. When the tax credit expired in September 2025, that strategy collapsed overnight. Ford’s F-150 Lightning now faces potential cancellation while GM laid off 3,400 workers at its battery plants.

The pivot back to profitable gas vehicles may boost short-term earnings, but it hands the EV future to Chinese competitors who built genuinely affordable cars without subsidy dependence. As we reported last week, Morgan Stanley now projects an “EV winter” lasting into 2026. Detroit’s less-than-5% market share isn’t a temporary setback. It’s the scoreboard after a decade of missed opportunities.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why are Detroit automakers pivoting back to gas vehicles?

Eased emissions regulations and the expiration of EV tax credits have made gasoline trucks and SUVs more profitable. TD Cowen estimates Ford, GM, and Stellantis could collectively gain $8 billion in profits from relaxed fuel economy standards.

Can American automakers catch up to Chinese EV rivals?

BloombergNEF’s Colin McKerracher says lack of manufacturing scale is why American automakers lose money on EVs.

INDIANAPOLIS – A full page open letter in the Sunday papers of the Indianapolis Star calls on the country’s largest technology company CEOs — Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella — to power their data centers with clean energy, or risk failing to meet their own climate goals.

The open letter says, in part:

We call on you to follow your climate goals by publicly calling on utilities to commit to no new gas and zero delayed coal plant retirements to power your data centers. As the largest customers on the grid, tell utilities you need an affordable and reliable decarbonized grid that benefits all customers.

AI data center proposals have continued to surge across Indiana and utilities have sought to capitalize off the proposals by introducing new gas plant projects or delaying coal plant closures to power these data centers, thereby raising energy costs for customers. Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) estimates that Big Tech’s data centers could more than double the need for power in its service territory, and by 2030, just a handful of I&M’s service area could use more electricity than all 6.8 million Hoosiers use in their homes combined.

Organizations signing the letter include Faith in Place, Earth Charter Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council, Indiana Environmental Clean Energy J40, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen, and the Sierra Club.

Megan Anderson, Senior Campaign Representative, Sierra Club:

“As Big Tech continues to introduce energy-hungry AI data centers in our communities, we need their leadership to course correct to make good on their climate commitments by using their dollars to build renewable energy and infrastructure that makes our electric grid more efficient and resilient. Plans to build out more fossil fuel power for these AI data centers not only betrays their own company values, but puts Hoosiers in the position to foot the bill. Our local leaders and Big Tech leaders need to be loud and clear: Hoosier families and small businesses shouldn’t be forced to subsidize the energy needs of Big Tech through higher energy bills and Big Tech shouldn’t be increasing pollution in Indiana communities.”

Shannon Anderson, Director of Advocacy, Earth Charter Indiana:

“Meeting the existential threat of climate with significant action was already going to be the fight of our lives. The rapid, unchecked development of hyper-scale data centers powered largely by natural gas obliterates our hopes of achieving near net zero emissions by mid century, a commitment these companies and several of our Hoosier cities have made to our children. It’s not just wrong, it’s cruel to abandon our kids this way.”

Sam Carpenter, Executive Director, Hoosier Environmental Council:

“Hoosier Environmental Council calls on the tech industry to focus on sustainability, affordable electric bills for Hoosiers, and transparency as they seek sites for AI data centers.

The problem, according to Aaron Zubaty, the concerned storage developer, is that power plants can now be reassigned unpredictably between ancillary services and energy.
He pulled his 350-megawatt battery fleet out of the day-ahead ancillary services the day that RTC+B took effect.
Plant owners can still secure a higher payment by committing their batteries in the day-ahead market for ancillary services.
There wasn’t a meltdown, as Zubaty put it, ​“in totally bland weather and market conditions.” But for an uneventful day, the ancillary service market got pretty spicy.","Texas has witnessed the country’s most dynamic grid battery expansion in recent years, thanks in large part to its famously competitive energy markets. Now, a wonky rule change could undermine batteries’ role in the grid.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas instituted new rules on Dec. 5 called ​“real-time co-optimization plus batteries,” or RTC+B. The idea is to allow ERCOT to reassign power plants between two major categories of grid activities: ancillary services, the rapid-response actions designed to keep the system stable and outage-free; and energy, the bulk delivery of megawatt-hours for consumption.

On paper, RTC+B sounds agreeable, and other grid operators in the country have been co-optimizing markets for years. ERCOT President and CEO Pablo Vegas said the update would bring greater efficiency and reliability to the system. He even called it ​“the most substantial enhancement to the Real-Time Nodal market design since its inception in 2010.” ERCOT leadership has promised more than $1 billion of wholesale market savings each year from the update.

But a major storage developer active in ERCOT is sounding the alarm about the risks these new rules create for storage operators — and initial metrics from Day 1 of RTC+B are consistent with what you’d expect if a bunch of battery owners pulled out of the ancillary service market because of uncertainty.

The problem, according to Aaron Zubaty, the concerned storage developer, is that power plants can now be reassigned unpredictably between ancillary services and energy. That uncertainty, plus additional stipulations around minimum state-of-charge levels for batteries to be chosen for ancillary services, could limit batteries’ ability to compete in those markets, where they had become a dominant force.

Zubaty runs Eolian, which built one of the first 100-megawatt energy storage plants in ERCOT in 2021 and is now building what would be Texas’ biggest battery. He pulled his 350-megawatt battery fleet out of the day-ahead ancillary services the day that RTC+B took effect.

“Storage is definitely in a different risk world than it was before RTC+B, because of added duration requirements that changed previously negotiated rules, which may not have been widely understood,” Zubaty said.

RTC+B enforces new requirements for the level of charge that batteries need in order to be dispatched for each ancillary service, which now happens every five minutes (these services used to be procured by the hour). Plant owners can still secure a higher payment by committing their batteries in the day-ahead market for ancillary services. But now, they could find their batteries getting reassigned to the energy market based on the RTC+B optimization algorithm, which might leave them with less energy than they need to qualify for ancillary service obligations later in the day. Not showing up for an obligation incurs financial penalties.

“ERCOT is managing Ancillary Service duration requirements more strictly,” a spokesperson told Canary Media in an email, adding that RTC+B considers a battery’s state of charge in the economic optimization calculation. ​“To the extent that the storage resources believe there are deployment risks, they can account for this in their offer strategy.”

After posting his concerns on LinkedIn ahead of the new rules, Zubaty said he heard from several other battery operators who shared his concerns about the new and poorly understood risks.

The behavior on Dec. 5 could prove to be a onetime blip. But if it becomes a pattern, especially on days of extreme demand, it could undo the state’s progress in tapping batteries to make the grid cheaper and more reliable for consumers.

Higher prices on the first day of new storage rules

The good news for Texans is that the grid didn’t break as operators and plant owners adjusted to the new rules. It helped that the weather cooperated, with no unseasonable cold spell to push the limit at a sensitive time. There wasn’t a meltdown, as Zubaty put it, ​“in totally bland weather and market conditions.”

But for an uneventful day, the ancillary service market got pretty spicy.

“Batteries have basically dominated the ancillary services market in the past few years, but they’ve also cratered the prices,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. Batteries can respond almost instantly, and don’t burn fuel, so they are particularly competitive at these grid services.

But day-ahead clearing prices shot up for Dec. 5, especially for a service called non-spin reserve. This service needs to respond in half an hour — ​“glacial compared to how fast batteries move,” Rhodes said. But to participate, batteries must be able to run for four hours, which is a higher bar for them to meet, given their limited runtime.

That day, ERCOT demand peaked at just under 60 gigawatts, with nearly 19 gigawatts of thermal plant outages; evening wind production was meager, barely generating 4 gigawatts as the sun set. Under those conditions, the day-ahead clearing price for non-spin rose to nearly $78.

To pick a comparison from that week, December 1 shared the key characteristics noted above: Load reached 60 gigawatts, thermal outages just passed 20 gigawatts, and evening wind barely passed 6 gigawatts. But on that day, before RTC+B, non-spin maxed out at just $25.

In other words, with major grid-performance metrics held constant, the change to RTC+B produced a tripling of the clearing price for this particular ancillary service. That’s exactly the kind of jump one would expect if the fleet of batteries ceded competition to a smaller group of fuel-burning power plants. Other, more-rapid-response ancillary services — ERCOT contingency reserve service, responsive reserve service, and regulation up — were also raised by 50% at the evening peak on Dec. 5, compared with Dec. 1. But they cleared at about half the price of non-spin.

“If the lowest-value service is now commanding the highest price, there’s probably something amiss,” Rhodes noted.

To be clear, those elevated prices haven’t returned in the days since. This could indicate that storage operators are dipping their toes back in the market after opening-day jitters or simply reflect how the mild weather in Texas is making things easy for the grid. ERCOT releases the details on winning bids 60 days after the fact, so the full picture won’t be clear until then.

Miguel Garcia, who runs bidding strategy for SMT Energy’s 13-project battery fleet in ERCOT, said that short-term pricing dislocations are to be expected with a big structural change like RTC+B. But he isn’t giving up on ancillary services.

“We’re being more deliberate about when and how we participate, based on system conditions, price signals, and state-of-charge positioning,” he said. ​“Ancillaries are no longer a ​‘set it and forget it’ product under RTC+B, but for operators who understand ERCOT dynamics, they remain very viable.”

Another experienced battery owner in ERCOT said they are still bidding into ancillary services, but they expect that the new state-of-charge rules will reduce storage participation in those markets, leading to higher prices. And when ancillary prices go up, energy prices tend to follow.

The real test for this new market design will come when the weather isn’t nice, Rhodes said — when a cold snap hits or if a heat wave strikes in May, when many thermal plants are still offline for spring maintenance.

If that happens, batteries probably won’t bid into day-ahead ancillary services as much as they would have under the old rules, Zubaty said. Then Texans will have to rely on a smaller number of older, more expensive natural gas and coal generators to play those essential grid-supporting roles. Constraining participation from batteries could lead prices to skyrocket unnecessarily.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Texas_battery-storage_Blue-Jay1688984188.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=648a3cb3d8e671e7daa4fe8a075ab5e2,N,,2025-12-16 04:58:51.125911

The presentation outlined a human-centered environmental strategy and called for renewed legislative collaboration to strengthen national policy.

Bárcena emphasized the central role of Indigenous peoples and local communities in conservation, noting that “more than 180 ecosystems have been safeguarded thanks to the ancestral knowledge of nearly 25 million people from Indigenous communities.” She described these groups as the country’s primary stewards of biodiversity and stressed the importance of their participation in environmental planning.

The minister said Mexico faces the challenge of reversing environmental degradation and shifting away from extractive development models. “We must balance economic development and the protection of ecosystems every day,” she said. “No nation, no matter how powerful, can stop the ecological transition the world demands.”

Bárcena outlined several priority objectives for the ministry, including the remediation of the Lerma, Santiago, Atoyac and Tula rivers; achieving a 35% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions under Mexico’s updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0); restoring 200,000 hectares of forest and 18,000 hectares of mangroves; and advancing a circular-economy agenda aimed at a “Zero Waste Republic.” She reiterated that Mexico intends to expand conservation areas to meet the global commitment of protecting 30% of terrestrial and marine territory.

She also called for a complete overhaul of the General Law of Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection, describing its reform as an urgent task that requires coordinated work with legislators. Strengthening public participation and ecological restoration, she said, is essential to ensuring social and environmental justice. “There can be no social justice without environmental justice,” she added.

Bárcena highlighted the Escazú Agreement as a key instrument for safeguarding environmental defenders. “Escazú is the only international treaty that protects environmental defenders, and we will promote it with full conviction,” she said.

A recent analysis we did showed that social aspects have not been sufficiently taken into account in CTF spending to date. Low- and middle-income households in particular benefit little from these subsidies, even though they bear a large part of the burden of CO₂ pricing. This should be made fairer.

In addition, it remains to be seen whether the funds from the Special Fund for Infrastructure and Climate Neutrality are being used sensibly, where the heating law reform is heading, and how the national CO2 price will develop.

Next year, crucial political decisions will have to be made if Germany wants to achieve its climate targets and, above all, enable lower-income households to achieve a socially just transition to climate neutrality.

The government aims to adopt the upcoming Climate Action Programme by March. What should be part of it?

The decisive factor for the impact on people's everyday lives will be how the social dimension is addressed in programme and whether it includes measures that go beyond the planned electric car subsidies based on income.

Germany is currently failing to meet its Effort Sharing Regulation targets, which set binding emission reduction targets for each EU country. This threatens to result in costs running into the billions by 2030, which would be better invested now in the transition: In the energy-efficient renovation of buildings, the replacement of fossil fuel heating systems, the socially tiered subsidy scheme for electric cars, and a high-performance public transport system, including bicycle infrastructure.

The federal government must now take significant corrective action, especially as price-dampening mechanisms in the ETS 2 are likely to keep prices significantly lower for the time being, making complementary instruments more important.

Has the coalition government done a good job integrating social and climate policy since it took office?

There is a real risk that the government backtracks on climate action, as can be seen, for example, in the debate on the phase-out of combustion engine cars and the heating law.

So far, the only positive measure that brings climate and social policy together is the announced programme to promote electric cars.

There’s no set formula for solar grazing, Weaver added.
Now, with solar grazing, the opportunity exists to raise a large number of sheep at scale and make a good living doing it.”","The wide expanses of rural America are foundational to one of the nation’s oldest businesses — raising crops and farm animals — along with one of the youngest: producing cheap, renewable energy.

Sometimes in conflict but often in harmony, the two industries are coming together in Raleigh, North Carolina, to form one of the Southeast’s first training facilities for agrivoltaics, in which the same land is used for agriculture and solar photovoltaic panels.

North Carolina State University launched the site last month and next semester will offer hands-on learning that focuses on solar grazing — sheep feeding on grasses and other vegetation beneath large ground-mounted arrays.

At the training ground, engineering students and solar professionals will be able to tinker with three rows of solar panels, learning how to mount and dismount panels from a unique racking system built for hilly terrain. Many might pet a sheep for the first time.

Meanwhile, would-be shepherds studying at N.C. State and practicing farmers could glimpse their first solar panels up close and learn how livestock interact with the equipment and its wires, inverters, and other related contraptions.

“A lot of sheep producers, they might be interested in solar grazing, but they’ve never stood next to a solar panel,” said Andrew Weaver, an assistant professor in animal science at the university. ​“What do these solar panels look like? How do they work? How do you graze around that panel?”

When it comes to large-scale solar projects, many rural communities in North Carolina and beyond have faced a steep learning curve. Just ask Steve Kalland, longtime director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, based at N.C. State.

The center has been conducting outreach sessions in rural North Carolina for years, countering both misinformation and a genuine lack of knowledge about whether solar panels degrade soil or threaten the state’s agricultural lands. Though the answer to both queries is generally no, he believes cooperation beats confrontation.

“We’re top five in the country in solar deployment and under 1% of agricultural land that’s being used for solar,” said Kalland, relaying stats backed up by the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association. ​“So I’m not worried about using up all of the agricultural land in the short run, the medium run, or even the long run. But finding ways to do things better together is always a better outcome.”

That’s why bringing solar and agriculture together for instruction at the university ​“is a perfect marriage in a lot of ways,” Kalland said.

Solar made for the farm

Nevados, which produces solar mounting systems engineered for slopes of up to 37%, donated equipment for the Raleigh site and helped design the curriculum. The Oakland, California–based company wanted an East Coast ​“sandbox” to better connect with the solar developers that buy its product on the other side of the country.

The Nevados technology, which repositions solar panels throughout the day to follow the sun, doesn’t require leveling the ground. That makes it well suited for agrivoltaics: Pastureland often undulates, and cropland is best undisturbed, said Rahul Chandra, vice president of product marketing at the company.

“What makes it special is that we can get away with almost zero grading underneath the array,” Chandra said. ​“That gives you some advantages, whether it’s for livestock grazing or maintaining crop production [and] natural soil chemistry. Our whole ethos with the technology is ​‘don’t touch the topsoil.’”

Many members of the solar industry are risk averse, Chandra said, making exposure to the relatively new Nevados design — which has been on the market for five years — vital to the tech’s takeoff.

“The N.C. State training is two parts,” he said. ​“You spend a few hours in the boring classroom right next door, and then you get to go hands-on with the tracking system. It’s a proven model in the solar industry.”

Weaver is eager to give his students practical experience, too. A sheep and goat specialist, he teaches a class on managing the ruminants that includes a lecture on solar grazing.

With the new training center up and running, Weaver said, he can better help pupils grapple with the nuances of raising sheep around solar infrastructure. ​“What can you touch? What don’t you touch? When do you call the solar company?”

Solar developers and operators can also learn some subtleties of sheep management, Weaver said. How do technicians move the livestock away from an area that needs repair while ensuring the animals still have water and a place to graze? When do they need to call a shepherd?

There’s no set formula for solar grazing, Weaver added. An acre of solar field can usually sustain between one and five sheep. Some immense solar projects can host a flock of sheep year-round; others contract with grazers the same way they would a mowing company.

A general rule of thumb is that grazing can cut mowing frequency in half, reducing the need for fossil-fueled combustion engines, Weaver said. ​“To me, mowing is kind of hypocritical if we want to preach clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

Like all livestock, sheep produce climate-warming pollution of their own, mostly in the form of methane. But solar grazing proponents say some of that can be offset with management practices that enhance a pasture’s ability to soak up carbon from the atmosphere.

A chance for the next generation of sheep farmers

Weaver is passionate about how solar projects could help foster a new generation of farmers who wouldn’t need to own land for pasture.

“Unless you come from family ground, it’s just about impossible to afford land these days,” he said. ​“Solar has really opened a door that the sheep industry hasn’t had for 50-plus years.”

Indeed, solar grazing is on the rise in North Carolina and across the country, with some 113,000 sheep responsible for maintaining the vegetation beneath 129,000 acres of solar panels, according to the American Solar Grazing Association.

The group doesn’t publish breakdowns by state, but the South leads the way, with nearly 62,000 sheep and over 87,000 acres — largely thanks to solar-abundant Texas.

And though the domestic lamb market today is small, with most of the meat Americans consume originating in Australia or New Zealand, that could change if more solar developers and sheep farmers work together, Weaver believes.

“You have a product that is 10,000 miles fresher, potentially has been harvested within the last week, and has a great story behind it,” he said.

“There’s a lot of young people that want to farm and don’t want to sit at a desk all day,” Weaver said. ​“Ten years ago, they didn’t have a choice: Finding that job in town was the only option. Now, with solar grazing, the opportunity exists to raise a large number of sheep at scale and make a good living doing it.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/11.25-nc-agrivoltaics-racking-sheep-panels-wider-view.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=02491ae046996ad5403a444a8699f70a,N,,2025-12-16 03:57:59.895041

JOHN, Associated Press, ALEXA ST. JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://cw39.com/news/business/ap-business/ap-ford-scraps-f150-lightning-as-mounting-losses-and-falling-consumer-interest-hits-ev-plans/,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is pivoting away from its once-ambitious electric vehicle plans amid financial losses and waning consumer demand for the vehicles in lieu of investment in more efficient gasoline-engines and hybrid EVs, the company said Monday.
“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.
“Ford’s elimination of the electric F-150 Lightning is not much of a surprise after the truck failed to come close to filling the plant’s capacity.
Biden targeted half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.
The Trump administration has since slashed that target, eliminated EV tax credits and proposed weakening the emissions and gas mileage rules.","DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. is pivoting away from its once-ambitious electric vehicle plans amid financial losses and waning consumer demand for the vehicles in lieu of investment in more efficient gasoline-engines and hybrid EVs, the company said Monday.

The Detroit automaker, which has poured billions of dollars into electrification along with most of its industry peers, said it will no longer make the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck, instead opting for an extended range version of the vehicle.

Ford will also introduce some manufacturing changes; its Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center — part of the BlueOval City campus and once the future of Ford’s EVs and batteries — is being renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant and will produce new affordable gas-powered trucks instead. Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant will produce a new gas and hybrid van.

The company has lost $13 billion on EVs since 2023 and said it expects to take a $19.5 billion hit largely in the fourth quarter due to the EV business.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” CEO Jim Farley said in a statement. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

Ford said it now expects half of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs — which also incorporate a gasoline-powered engine — and full EVs by 2030, up from 17% this year.

“Ford’s elimination of the electric F-150 Lightning is not much of a surprise after the truck failed to come close to filling the plant’s capacity. Ford’s choice to convert an existing gas-powered truck to accept the electric drivetrain helped reduce their upfront costs which, in hindsight, was the right move,” Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.

“For months, the future of Blue Oval City has been in question and this announcement locks in the direction of this large plant,” Fiorani added. “Adding an affordable vehicle to the Ford lineup fills a glaring gap in the market.”

Several other automakers have made changes to their electrified product plans in recent years as consumer demand for EVs in the U.S. hasn’t quite met expectations.

EVs accounted for about 8% of new vehicles sales in the U.S. last year, but factors such as cost and charging infrastructure remain concerns for mainstream buyers.

The average transaction price for a new EV last month was $58,638, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Meanwhile, while public charging availability has improved, the industry has relied on home charging as a selling point for prospective buyers, and not everyone has access to charging at-home.

Since taking office for a second time, President Donald Trump has drastically shifted U.S. policy away from EVs, calling EV-friendly policy set under former President Joe Biden a “mandate.”

Though Biden-era policies — including generous tax incentives for consumers, and tailpipe and fuel economy rules for automakers — encouraged EV adoption, no policies required the industry to sell or Americans to buy EVs. Biden targeted half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Trump administration has since slashed that target, eliminated EV tax credits and proposed weakening the emissions and gas mileage rules.

“The one-two punch of the public’s slow EV adoption and the Trump administration’s softer stance on fuel economy and emissions has encouraged every automaker to re-think their current direction,” Fiorani added. “Electric vehicles are still the future, but the transition to EVs was always going to take longer than automakers have been promising the public.”

According to the latest report from SNE Research, global EV battery capacity reached 933.5 GWh in 2025, a 35.2% year-on-year (YoY) increase. Here are five key takeaways from the report, featuring direct quotes from SNE Research.

1. Global EV battery usage grows by 35.2%

SNE Research reports that global EV battery usage reached 933.5GWh during the first ten months of 2025, reflecting a 35.2% YoY increase. This growth highlights the accelerating adoption of EVs worldwide, driven by consumer demand and advancements in battery technology.

According to the report, “The amount of energy held by batteries for electric vehicles (EV, PHEV, HEV) registered worldwide was approximately 933.5GWh, a 35.2% YoY growth.” This surge demonstrates the industry’s ability to scale production and meet the growing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.

2. CATL and BYD lead the market

Chinese manufacturers continue to dominate the global EV battery market. CATL retained its top position with 355.2GWh usage, growing 36.6% YoY, supported by partnerships with major automakers like Tesla, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. BYD, which produces both EVs and batteries in-house, ranked second with 157.9GWh usage, growing 36.1% YoY.

SNE Research notes, “BYD has been expanding its presence not only in the Chinese domestic market but also in the overseas market. In particular, BYD has boasted a noticeable growth in the European market. Between Jan and Oct 2025, BYD’s battery usage in Europe reached 11.2GWh, exhibiting a 216.4% increase year-on-year.”

These figures highlight the dominance of Chinese manufacturers, who leverage their scale, cost efficiency, and technological innovation to maintain a competitive edge.

3. Korean manufacturers see market share decline

The report highlights a decline in the combined market share of Korean battery makers (e.g., LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Samsung SDI), which fell to 16.0%, a 3.5 percentage point drop YoY.

SNE Research states, “The combined market shares of LG Energy Solution, SK On, and Samsung SDI in global electric vehicle battery usage from Jan to Oct in 2025 posted 16.0%, a 3.5% percentage point decline from the same period last year.” While LG Energy Solution experienced growth due to strong sales of Kia EV3 and Chevrolet EV models, it faced challenges from declining Tesla-related battery usage. SK On benefited from steady sales of Hyundai, Volkswagen, and Ford EVs, while Samsung SDI struggled with reduced demand from Rivian and competition from Gotion’s LFP batteries.

4. Regional policy shifts reshape the market

SNE Research emphasizes the impact of regional policy changes on the EV battery market. In North America, automakers are securing long-term procurement agreements to stabilize costs and reduce supply risks. Europe is accelerating efforts to localize battery production and material sourcing, aiming to reduce dependence on imports. Meanwhile, Asian manufacturers are focusing on product differentiation through advanced technologies like high-energy-density cells and next-generation battery management systems (BMS).

The report notes, “By the end of 2025, the global EV battery market continues to experience demand growth, while shifts in regional policy environments and restructuring of technology strategies are making the competitive landscape increasingly complex.”

5. Future competitiveness depends on strategic portfolios

Looking ahead, SNE Research predicts that after 2026, market competitiveness will hinge on manufacturers’ ability to operate strategic portfolios tailored to regional conditions. Companies will need to balance technological innovation, production scale, and flexible supply chains to respond to evolving policies and market demands.

The report concludes, “Ultimately, after 2026, market competitiveness will be determined less by global expansion and more by the ability to operate strategic portfolios tailored to the regulatory, demand, and supply conditions of each region.”

The SNE Research report provides valuable insights into the global EV battery market, highlighting robust growth and the increasing complexity of the competitive landscape. As manufacturers navigate these changes, their ability to innovate, scale production, and adapt to local conditions will be critical to sustaining growth and maintaining competitiveness in the years ahead.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt298168e5ea645c91/69407928587e50a36932e457/EV_Batt_Insights.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-16 08:59:16.412551

This change would mean that classification determinations could consider economic impacts when evaluating listings and critical habitat designations.
The current 4(d) “blanket rule” extends a majority of the Section 9 protections that apply to endangered species to threatened species.
AB 1319 directs the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to monitor federal actions that may decrease federal protections for endangered or threatened species.
This document is intended to provide you with general information regarding possible changes to endangered species laws.","As we speed towards 2026, the federal government has taken steps to resuscitate regulations adopted by the first Trump administration related to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has published four proposed rules—two in conjunction with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)—and proposed changes that largely revert the regulations back to what the previous Trump administration put in place in 2019.

These proposed regulations would:

Modify elements of the process for the listing of endangered and threatened species and critical habitat designation (50 CFR 424)

Make changes to the Section 7 consultation with FWS and NMFS (50 CFR part 402)

Change protections for threatened species under section 4(d)

Change critical habitat exclusions (50 CFR 17; section 4(b)(2))

The proposed revisions are prospective in nature and would not affect current listed species or critical habitat designations.

The comment period for these proposed rules is open until Dec. 22, 2025. Comments may be submitted electronically on the Federal eRulemaking Portal or by visiting the links above.

Why are FWS and NMFS Proposing Rule Revisions?

According to the FWS press release, the proposed changes are part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to “strengthen American energy, improve regulatory predictability, and ensure federal actions align with the best reading of the law.” FWS and NMFS have indicated that the proposed rules are, in part, a response to executive orders (EO) issued in early 2025, primarily EO 14154 “Unleashing American Energy” and EO 14219 “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s Department of Government Efficiency Deregulatory Initiative.” These EOs directed agencies to review rules that impose “undue burdens” or lack “clear statutory authority.” The proposed changes also respond to pending lawsuits challenging 2019 and 2024 rules implementing the ESA as well as the 2024 Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which overturned prior caselaw that had accorded judicial deference to an agency’s reading of a statute (commonly referred to as “Chevron deference”).

These proposed regulations follow earlier steps by the current administration to modify regulatory burdens. Other examples include FWS and NMFS’s proposed rulemaking to rescind the regulatory definition of “harm,” FWS’s request for input on changes to Section 10 permitting regulations, and the Department of Interior’s request for comments on regulatory reform.

Proposed Changes to Species Listing and Critical Habitat Designation (50 CFR Part 424)

The proposed rule revises factors for listing, delisting and reclassifying species under the ESA to return to the version of these regulations promulgated in 2019.

Economic Impacts: The proposed rule removes the phrase “without reference to possible economic or other impacts of such determination” when making classification determinations. This change would mean that classification determinations could consider economic impacts when evaluating listings and critical habitat designations.

Foreseeable Future: Under the ESA, a “threatened species” is any species that is likely to become an endangered species in the “foreseeable future.” The proposed rule would change the definition of “foreseeable future” to “extend only so far into the future as FWS and NMFS can reasonably determine that both the future threats and the species’ responses to those threats are likely.” This change likely narrows the definition of threatened species.

Delisting Species: The proposed rule makes the parameters for delisting the species the same as the standards for deciding not to list a species in the first instance. Current criteria includes delisting a species if it has recovered. The proposal removes the reference to recovery and modifies the delisting criteria to include three circumstances in which it is appropriate to delist a species: (1) the species is extinct, (2) the species does not meet the definition of an endangered species or a threatened species, or (3) the listed entity does not meet the definition of a species.

The proposed rule also makes revisions to the criteria for designating critical habitat:

No-Prudent Determinations: The proposed rule enumerates specific circumstances in which the FWS and NMFS may find that it is not prudent to designate critical habitat, including when threats to a species’ habitat stem solely from causes that cannot be addressed by management actions identified in a Section 7(a)(2) consultation.

Designating Unoccupied Areas: The proposed rule would make it so that FWS and NMFS cannot designate unoccupied areas as critical habitat unless the occupied areas are “inadequate to ensure the conservation of species.”

Both of these revisions will likely result in less areas considered for and designated as critical habitat.

Proposed Changes to Section 7 Consultation (50 CFR part 402)

Under Section 7 of the ESA, federal agencies are required to consult with FWS and NMFS to ensure that any federal action is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. The proposed rule largely reinstates the interagency cooperation regulations in place during the first Trump administration, which provide a framework for how the Section 7 consultation is to be carried out. The rule clarifies that non-discretionary federal action is not subject to Section 7 consultation.

In addition, the proposed rule:

Changes the definition of “effects of the action” by limiting the effects to those that are a causal response reasonably certain to occur and that would otherwise not occur but for the proposed action.

Clarifies when activities and effects are “reasonably certain to occur” by providing a non-exhaustive list of factors that must be considered by agencies.

Changes the definition of “environmental baseline” to refer to the current condition of the species or its designated critical habitat as would reasonably be expected to occur without the consequences caused by the action at the time of the proposed action.

Removes the option for offsetting as a reasonable and prudent measure in an incidental take statement.

Proposal to Remove the “Blanket Rule” for Threatened Species (50 CFR part 17; section 4(d))

Section 4(d) of the ESA directs the secretary of the Interior to issue protective regulations deemed “necessary and advisable for the conservation of” threatened species. Section 9 of the ESA provides a specific list of prohibited actions related to endangered animals but does not provide these same prohibitions for plants or threatened animals. The current 4(d) “blanket rule” extends a majority of the Section 9 protections that apply to endangered species to threatened species.

The proposed rule would eliminate the “blanket-rule” and instead require FWS to issue species-specific 4(d) rules (or prohibited actions) for newly listed threatened species. The FWS argues that removing the “blanket rule” allows for more tailored protection of threatened animals.

NMFS does not have a corresponding 4(d) “blanket rule” and currently develops specific 4(d) rules for each threatened species.

Proposed Changes to Critical Habitat Exclusion Analysis (50 CFR part 17; section 4(b)(2))

Under Section 4(b)(2) of the ESA, when FWS designates critical habitat for listed species, it may exclude an area from designation if it determines that the benefits of excluding outweigh the benefits of including the area in a critical habitat designation. The proposed rule, which only applies to FWS’s implementation of the ESA, articulates when and how FWS will undertake an exclusion analysis when designating critical habitat. Among other things, the proposed regulation requires FWS to consider the economic impact, impact on national security and any other relevant impacts prior to designation.

Response in California

Perhaps anticipating actions by the federal government that might reduce federal protection of threatened and endangered species, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill (AB) 1319, which was signed into law in October 2025. AB 1319 directs the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to monitor federal actions that may decrease federal protections for endangered or threatened species. If the CDFW finds that such actions would “substantially impact” federally listed species, it may provisionally list those species as long as it determines that doing so would “significantly reduce” the impact. Under AB 1319, a “federally listed species” must be (1) native to California, (2) listed or a candidate for listing under the federal ESA as of Jan. 1, 2025, and (3) not currently protected by the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) (Fish and Game Code Section 2050 et seq.). The bill defines a decrease in federal protections to be an action that reduces the level of protection provided to a federally listed species, including, but not limited to, delisting species, changing the listing status of species from endangered to threatened, eliminating or changing the prohibitions on take, or decreasing the amount of mitigation required for permits or other approvals. The provisional listing of a species under AB 1319 does not affect the obligations of entities that are operating under a federal “take” authorization that was in place as of Jan. 19, 2025. The bill will automatically be repealed on Jan. 1, 2032.

AB 1319 could step in to protect species affected by the proposed federal rules—for example, if a federally threatened species loses section 4(d) protections or is delisted—but only if CDFW determines that the federal change will substantially impact a specific species and that provisional listing will significantly reduce that impact.

And in the background, CDFW and the California Fish and Game Commission continue to work through a list of pending petitions to list species under CESA. These include: burrowing owl, white sturgeon, southern resident killer whales, pacific pocket mouse, western spadefoot toad and petitions for 23 different plant species. Unlike the ESA, species that the Fish and Game Commission finds may meet the standard for listing (i.e., “candidate species”) receive full protection under state law. The standard to find a species qualifies as a candidate species is a relatively easy hurdle. The Fish and Game Commission will be taking further action to process and decide these petitions over the course of 2026.

Ford had invested heavily in battery plants to supply EV production lines that are now idling.","It was supposed to be the dawn of a new era for America’s best-selling vehicle. When Ford unveiled the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup in 2021, the announcement landed like a thunderclap across the automotive world. The company promised a future where the iconic truck would not only haul, tow, and power worksites, but do it all with zero tailpipe emissions and a starting price of just $40,000. Fast-forward to December 2025, and that bold vision has hit a wall. Ford has officially ended production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, pivoting sharply away from its full-EV strategy and toward a mix of gasoline, hybrid, and range-extended electric vehicles.

According to NPR, the company wrapped up production of the 2025 F-150 Lightning this month, less than five years after its much-hyped launch. The decision, Ford executives say, is driven by a combination of stubborn market realities, shifting consumer preferences, and a tough financial picture. ""This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,"" CEO Jim Farley explained in a statement, as reported by Driving. ""The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.""

Andrew Frick, president of Ford Blue and Ford Model e, echoed that sentiment on a call with reporters: ""The American consumer is speaking clearly and they want the benefits of electrification like instant torque and mobile power. But they also demand affordability … rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas."" (NPR)

The Lightning’s demise comes after a turbulent run. Ford’s Model e division, responsible for electric vehicles, lost about $5 billion last year (Driving). The company had once planned for up to 150,000 annual Lightning sales, but the real number never surpassed 40,000 units a year (Motor1). The Lightning was also supposed to start at $40,000, but by the time the 2025 model hit showrooms, the sticker price was closer to $55,000—and most versions sold for $60,000 to $90,000, putting them well out of reach for many buyers. Even with generous incentives, the truck failed to meet expectations.

Production headaches didn’t help. Earlier this year, a fire at one of Ford’s aluminum suppliers caused a scarcity of the metal, forcing a halt in Lightning production. When the lines restarted, Ford prioritized the more profitable gas-burning F-150s, which remain America’s favorite vehicle. Employees from the electric vehicle plant were reassigned to support increased shifts for gas and hybrid truck production in Dearborn (Motor1).

Despite these challenges, the Lightning managed to rack up accolades. It won the 2023 Truck of the Year from Motortrend and the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards, and was Kelley Blue Book’s top pick for electric trucks in 2024 (NPR). Ford says it was also the best-selling electric truck in America last quarter. Yet, as NPR notes, the entire EV pickup segment struggled with performance, affordability, and reliability—especially when it came to towing range, a crucial metric for truck buyers.

So what’s next for Ford’s electrification push? The company isn’t abandoning electric vehicles entirely, but it’s dramatically changing course. The next-generation F-150 Lightning, which may keep the Lightning name, will be a range-extended EV (EREV)—a plug-in hybrid where the wheels are always powered by an electric motor, but a gasoline engine acts as a generator to recharge the battery on the go. This move, Ford hopes, will appeal to a much broader swath of customers who want the benefits of electrification without the limitations of battery-only range. Pure internal-combustion trucks will also remain in the lineup.

Ford’s shift comes with a hefty price tag. The company estimates the pivot away from full EVs will cost about $20 billion in write-offs and cash this year (Driving, NPR). But executives argue it’s a necessary step to replace money-losing models with ones that stand a chance of turning a profit. The 15th-generation F-150 is expected to debut in 2028, and the new EREV Lightning will be built in Michigan rather than the originally planned Tennessee plant. That Tennessee facility, meanwhile, will be repurposed to produce an affordable gas-powered truck starting in 2029—a model not currently found in Ford’s lineup (Driving).

Another major consequence of the Lightning’s demise is what happens to all those batteries. Ford had invested heavily in battery plants to supply EV production lines that are now idling. Rather than let that capacity go to waste, Ford will revamp a battery production site in Kentucky to build batteries for stationary storage. These batteries will help balance the electric grid—charging up when renewable energy is abundant and discharging when electricity is scarce. They’ll also be sold to data centers and other industrial customers, opening a new revenue stream for the automaker (NPR).

Ford’s future EV plans are shrinking in size and price. The company is targeting a $30,000 midsize EV pickup, with production expected to start roughly a year from now. It also reaffirmed support for the Universal Electric Vehicle platform, which will underpin a $30,000 compact truck starting in 2027 (Motor1, NPR).

Industry analysts point to a confluence of factors behind Ford’s pivot. The EV market grew more slowly than expected, and the Lightning’s close resemblance to its gas-powered sibling made it a tough sell—why pay $10,000 to $15,000 more for a truck that looks the same, is less familiar, and can’t tow as far? Meanwhile, changes in the U.S. regulatory environment have also played a role. The Trump administration has rolled back EV tax credits and fuel economy standards that once pushed automakers to keep unprofitable electric vehicles in production. With those incentives gone, Ford and others have less reason to stick with costly EVs that aren’t selling (NPR).

For some, the Lightning’s end is a cautionary tale about the challenges of electrifying America’s favorite vehicles. For others, it’s a pragmatic response to market realities and an evolving regulatory landscape. As Ford pivots toward hybrids, range-extended EVs, and smaller electric trucks, the story of the F-150 Lightning serves as a reminder that even the boldest bets can fizzle out when the numbers don’t add up.

In the end, the Lightning’s brief but eventful run leaves Ford with lessons learned, a new direction, and—perhaps—a clearer view of what American truck buyers really want.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/7szq7geOVzZmzIC5gLZhKni5kZQ=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F0fee8c6f-61d5-465e-9b8b-20e4d4b7d86e.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 05:57:46.970774

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

Proposed Acquisition of TRC for a total cash purchase price of US$3.3 billion (approximately $4.5 billion based on the exchange rate of $1.3762 USD/CAD as of December 15, 2025).

Acquisition price represents 14.5x TRC’s Pre-IFRS 16 CY2026E Adjusted EBITDA7 pre-synergies and 12.5x after including run-rate synergies.8 (TRC’s Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and earnings before net interest and income tax for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 were approximately US$192.3 million ($268.5 million) and US$87.5 million ($122.1 million), respectively).

Expected to be low-to-mid single-digit percentage accretive to WSP’s adjusted net earnings per share before synergies. WSP expects 2027 Accretion (as defined below) to be high single-digit percentage accretive once cost synergies are fully realized (WSP’s basic net earnings per share attributable to shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share were $5.40 and $8.05 respectively, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024).2 9

Expected cost synergies to exceed 3% of TRC’s net revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 20257, plus potential cross-selling revenue synergy opportunities in alignment with our POWER Engineers experience (TRC's net revenues and revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 2025 were approximately US$1,192.2 million and US$1,498.9 million, respectively).8

Transaction to be financed with US$3.3 billion of Committed Acquisition Financing (as defined below).

Estimated pro forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio6 of ~2.4x upon closing of the Acquisition with the expectation to return to below 2.0x within 12 months6 (WSP's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 27, 2025 was 1.4x and adjusted EBITDA and earnings before net financing expense and income taxes for the same period were approximately $2,501.4 million and $1,481.0 million, respectively).

Equity raise of approximately $850 million: $732 million bought deal public offering and approximately $118 million private placement of common shares of WSP (“Common Shares”) expected to close on or about December 22, 2025, with a corresponding reduction of the amounts drawn from the Committed Acquisition Financing. WSP may also opportunistically access debt capital markets to repay a further portion of the Committed Acquisition Financing should market conditions be favourable.

WEBCAST

WSP will host a webcast today at 4:45 p.m. (Eastern Daylight Time) to discuss the Acquisition. Exceptionally, there will be no question-and-answer session, given the concurrent equity offering.

To join the webcast, please register at https://www.icastpro.ca/rp92yd or access https://www.wsp.com/en-gl/investors.

CONDITIONS TO THE ACQUISITION

Subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals, the Acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

ACQUISITION FINANCING

Equity Financing

The Equity Financing (as defined below) comprises:

$732 million bought deal public offering (the “Offering”) of common shares (the “Offering Common Shares”) at a price of $232.80 per Offering Common Share (the “Offer Price”); and

Approximately $118 million private placement (the “Concurrent Private Placement” and together with the Offering, the “Equity Financing”) of common shares (the “Placement Common Shares”) at the Offer Price to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“La Caisse”).

WSP intends to use the net proceeds from the Equity Financing to fund in part the purchase price payable in respect of the Acquisition (and related costs and expenses) and accordingly reduce amounts to be drawn on the closing of the Acquisition under the Committed Acquisition Financing to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition.

Public Offering

WSP has entered into an agreement with CIBC Capital Markets, BMO Capital Markets and National Bank Capital Markets (the “Joint Bookrunners”), on behalf of a syndicate of underwriters (the “Underwriters”), to issue and sell, on a “bought deal” basis, 3,145,000 Offering Common Shares at the Offer Price for gross proceeds to the Corporation of $732 million.

The Corporation has granted the Underwriters an over-allotment option (the “Over-Allotment Option”), exercisable in whole or in part, for a period of 30 days following the date of the closing of the Offering to purchase up to an additional number of Offering Common Shares equal to 15% of the Offering Common Shares to be sold pursuant to the Offering at the Offer Price to cover over-allotments, if any, and for market stabilization purposes.

The Offering Common Shares distributed pursuant to the Offering will be offered in all provinces and territories of Canada pursuant to a prospectus supplement (the “Prospectus Supplement”) to the short form base shelf prospectus of WSP dated August 8, 2024 (the “Base Shelf Prospectus”) to be filed by WSP on or about December 17, 2025, as well as in the United States by way of private placement to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”).

The completion of the Offering is subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”). Closing of the Offering is expected to occur on or about December 22, 2025 and is conditional upon the concurrent completion of the Concurrent Private Placement.

No securities regulatory authority has either approved or disapproved the contents of this press release. The Offering Common Shares have not been, and will not be, registered under the 1933 Act, or any state securities laws. Accordingly, the Offering Common Shares may not be offered or sold within the United States unless registered under the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws or pursuant to exemptions from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States, nor shall there be any sale of the Offering Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Delivery of the Prospectus Supplement, and any amendments to the documents will be provided in accordance with securities legislation relating to procedures for providing access to a shelf prospectus supplement, and any amendment. The Prospectus Supplement will be (within two business days of the date hereof) accessible on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. An electronic or paper copy of the Prospectus Supplement, and any amendment to the documents, may be obtained without charge from CIBC Capital Markets at 161 Bay Street, 5th Floor, Toronto, ON M5J 2S8 or by telephone at 1-416-956-6378 or by email at mailbox.Canadianprospectus@cibc.com by providing the contact with an email address or address, as applicable. The Prospectus Supplement contains important, detailed information about the Corporation and the proposed Offering. Prospective investors should read the Prospectus Supplement (when filed) before making an investment decision.

Concurrent Private Placement

Concurrently with this announcement, WSP has also entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which the Corporation will complete the Concurrent Private Placement at the Offer Price with La Caisse for aggregate gross proceeds to the Corporation of approximately $118 million.

La Caisse has also been granted an option (the “Additional Subscription Option”) to purchase a number of additional Placement Common Shares representing up to 15% of the number of Placement Common Shares subscribed by them on closing, subject to, and in the same proportion as the Over-Allotment Option being exercised by the Underwriters.

The issuance of the Placement Common Shares under the Concurrent Private Placement is subject to the approval of the TSX. Closing of the Concurrent Private Placement is scheduled to occur concurrently with the closing of the Offering and is conditional upon the concurrent completion of the Offering.

Assuming completion of the Concurrent Private Placement and the Offering, but not the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option or the Additional Subscription Option, La Caisse will beneficially own, or exercise control or direction over, directly or indirectly, an aggregate of 18,619,100 Common Shares representing approximately 13.9% of the then issued and outstanding Common Shares.

The Placement Common Shares will be subject to a four-month hold from the closing date of the Concurrent Private Placement. In accordance with the terms of the Subscription Agreement, the Placement Common Shares will also be subject to contractual lockups for a period of four (4) months following the date of issuance of such Placement Common Shares.

La Caisse (or their respective designee) will be entitled to a capital commitment fee equal to 4% of the aggregate purchase price for the Placement Common Shares for which they have subscribed (and any additional Placement Common Shares they have subscribed pursuant to the Additional Subscription Option, as applicable).

Committed Acquisition Financing

Concurrently with the announcement of the Acquisition, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as co-lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, provided commitments for US$3,300 million senior unsecured non-revolving term loans (collectively, the “Committed Acquisition Financing”). The Committed Acquisition Financing will be governed by an incremental facility supplement to the Corporation’s seventh amended and restated credit agreement dated as of April 27, 2023, as amended and supplemented from time to time, with a syndicate of financial institutions to be entered into on or before the closing of the Acquisition.

All of the above elements of the Acquisition financing plan have been designed and structured with a view to preserving WSP’s investment grade rating.

Related Party Transaction Matters

La Caisse beneficially owns, or has control or direction over, directly or indirectly, Common Shares representing more than 10% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares of WSP. As a result of the foregoing, the Concurrent Private Placement is a “related party transaction” for the purposes of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of minority security holders in special transactions (“MI 61-101”). The Corporation has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority approvals of MI 61-101 contained in paragraphs 5.5(a) and 5.7(a) of MI 61-101 on the basis that neither the fair market value of the Concurrent Private Placement (including the capital commitment fee payable thereunder), nor the consideration thereof, exceeds 25% of the market capitalization of the Corporation.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain information contained herein is not based on historical facts and may constitute forward-looking statements or forward-looking information under Canadian securities laws (collectively, “forward-looking statements”). Forward-looking statements may include estimates, plans, strategic ambitions, objectives, expectations, opinions, forecasts, projections, guidance, outlook, expectations regarding the requirements of various end markets, demand for and investments in power and energy related services and infrastructure, trends or other statements that are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements made by the Corporation in this document may include statements about the Acquisition, the benefits, synergies and opportunities of the Acquisition, the Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement and the use of proceeds therefrom; the closing of the Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement; the conditions precedent to the closing of the Acquisition; the expected closing date of the Acquisition; the Committed Acquisition Financing, available liquidities, the attractiveness of the Acquisition from a financial perspective and expected accretion in various financial metrics (including estimated 2027 Accretion, Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and WSP’s Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio upon closing of the Acquisition and within 12 months following closing of the Acquisition); expectations regarding anticipated cost savings and synergies; the strength, complementarity and compatibility of TRC’s business with WSP’s existing business and teams; other anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and their expected impact on WSP’s delivery of its strategic plan and its long-term vision, future growth, results of operations, financial performance, business, prospects and opportunities, WSP’s business outlook, objectives, development, plans, integration, growth strategies and other strategic priorities, and WSP’s leadership position in its markets; and statements relating to WSP’s future growth, results of operations, performance business, prospects and opportunities, the expected synergies to be realized and certain expected financial ratios and other statements that are not historical facts. Forward-looking statements can typically be identified by terminology such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “forecast,” “project,” “intend,” “target,” “potential,” “continue” or the negative of these terms or terminology of a similar nature. Such forward-looking statements reflect current beliefs of Management and are based on certain factors and assumptions, which by their nature are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties. While the Corporation considers these factors and assumptions to be reasonable based on information available as at the date hereof, actual events or results could differ materially from the results, predictions, forecasts, conclusions or projections expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements made by WSP are based on a number of assumptions believed by WSP to be reasonable as at the date hereof, including assumptions set out through this document and including, without limitation, principal assumptions about the satisfaction of all closing conditions and the successful completion of the Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement within the anticipated timeframe; the expected timing of completion of the Acquisition and the conditions precedent to the closing of the Acquisition (including the receipt of regulatory approvals); WSP’s ability to retain and attract new business, achieve synergies and maintain market position arising from successful integration plans relating to the Acquisition; WSP’s ability to otherwise complete the integration of TRC within anticipated time periods and at expected cost levels; WSP’s ability to attract and retain key employees in connection with the Acquisition; Management’s estimates and expectations in relation to future economic and business conditions and other factors in relation to the Acquisition and resulting impact on growth and accretion in various financial metrics; Management’s expectations in relation to the future performance and economic conditions and other factors in relation to TRC; the realization of the expected strategic, financial and other benefits of the Acquisition in the timeframe anticipated; the accuracy and completeness of the information (including financial information) provided by TRC and publicly available information; the absence of significant undisclosed costs or liabilities associated with the Acquisition; general economic and political conditions; organic growth expectations; economic and market assumptions regarding competition; the state of the global economy and the economies of the regions in which WSP or TRC operates; the state of and access to global and local capital and credit markets; interest rates; working capital requirements; the collection of accounts receivable; WSP obtaining new contract awards; the type of contracts entered into by WSP; the anticipated margins under new contract awards; the adequate utilization of WSP’s workforce; the ability of WSP to attract new clients; the ability of WSP to retain current clients; changes in contract performance; project delivery; WSP’s competitors; the ability of the Corporation to successfully integrate businesses; the acquisition and integration of businesses in the future; WSP’s ability to manage growth; external factors affecting the global operations of WSP; the state of WSP’s backlog and pipeline of opportunities in various reportable segments; the joint arrangements into which WSP has entered or will enter; capital investments made by the public and private sectors; relationships with suppliers and subconsultants; relationships with management, key professionals and other employees of WSP; the maintenance of sufficient insurance; the management of environmental, social and health and safety risks; the sufficiency of the WSP’s current and planned information systems, communications technology and other technology; the sufficiency of the Corporation’s cybersecurity measures; compliance with laws and regulations; future legal proceedings; the sufficiency of internal and disclosure controls; the regulatory environment; impairment of goodwill; foreign currency fluctuation; the expected benefits of acquisitions and the expected synergies to be realized as a result thereof; the tax legislation and regulations to which WSP is subject and the state of WSP’s benefit plans, as well as the assumptions underlying the 2025 financial outlook set out in WSP’s press releases dated February 12, 2025, August 6, 2025 and November 5, 2025. If any of these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, WSP’s actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements.

In evaluating these forward-looking statements, investors should specifically consider various risk factors, which, if realized, could cause WSP’s actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to: risks and uncertainties relating to the dilutive effect of the Offering on holders of Common Shares; the fact that the declaration of dividends on the Common Shares is at the discretion of the board of directors of WSP; the fact that the price at which the Common Shares under the Offering are sold by the Underwriters may be less than the Offering Price; the fact that the Concurrent Private Placement may not be completed; Management’s broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds of the Offering if the Acquisition is not completed; WSP’s inability to successfully integrate TRC’s business upon completion of the Acquisition; the possible delay or failure to close the Acquisition; the potential failure to realize anticipated benefits from the Acquisition; the potential failure to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all; the currency exchange risk and foreign currency exposure related to the purchase price payable in respect of the Acquisition; WSP’s reliance upon publicly available information and information provided by TRC in connection with, and for the purposes of, the Acquisition; risks associated with historical and pro forma financial information; potential undisclosed costs or liabilities associated with the Acquisition; the fact that WSP does not currently own TRC and that no assurance of TRC’s future performance can be given; WSP’s or TRC’s businesses being adversely impacted during the pendency of the Acquisition; change of control and other similar provisions and fees; risks relating to the post-Acquisition business and operations of WSP and TRC, as well as other risk factors discussed in greater detail in section 20, “Risk Factors,” of WSP’s Management Discussion and Analysis for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024 and in section 17, “Risk Factors,” of WSP’s Management Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 27, 2025, and as may be supplemented from time to time in reports filed by the Corporation with securities regulators or securities commissions or other documents that the Corporation makes public, which are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and which sections are incorporated herein by reference into this cautionary statement.

Although we have attempted to identify important risk factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other risk factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material that could also cause actual results or future events to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. WSP cautions that the foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other unknown or unpredictable factors could have also a material adverse effect on the performance or results of WSP or TRC. Actual results and events may be significantly different from what we currently expect because of the risks associated with our business, industry and global economy and of the assumptions made in relation to these risks. As such, there can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with forward-looking statements. The completion of the Acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, termination rights and other risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation and as applicable, regulatory approvals, and there can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be completed. There can also be no assurance that if the Acquisition is completed, the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Acquisition will be realized.

To the extent any forward-looking statement in this document constitutes financial outlook or future-oriented financial information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws, such information is intended to provide investors with information regarding the Corporation, including the Corporation’s assessment of future financial plans, and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Financial outlook (including assumptions about future events, including economic conditions and proposed courses of action, based on the Corporation’s assessment of the relevant information currently available), as with forward-looking statements generally, is based on current estimates, expectations and assumptions and is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and other factors. Any financial outlook or future oriented financial information included in this document has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent auditor of the Corporation, has not audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to any such financial outlook or future-oriented financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion with respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in the Prospectus Supplement relates to the Corporation’s previously issued financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2024. It does not extend to any financial outlook or future-oriented financial information and should not be read to do so.

Differences could arise because of events announced or completed after the date of this press release. All of the forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of the date hereof (unless otherwise specified) and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except to the extent required by applicable law, WSP does not assume any obligation to publicly update or to revise any forward-looking statements made in this document or otherwise, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Readers are also referred to cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements included in the Prospectus Supplement.

Additional Underlying Assumptions

The Corporation cautions that the assumptions used to prepare the estimated 2027 Accretion, Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, and WSP’s Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio upon closing of the Acquisition and within 12 months following closing of the Acquisition could prove to be incorrect or inaccurate. Accordingly, the actual results could differ materially from the Corporation’s expectations as set out in this press release. The Corporation considered numerous economic and market assumptions regarding the foreign exchange rate, competition, political environment, and economic performance of each region where the Corporation and TRC operate. In addition to the assumptions disclosed above under “Forward-Looking Statements”, the following assumptions were used to develop these forward-looking financial measures:

2027 Accretion:

WSP’s net revenue organic growth of approximately the same level as the average of the last three years for each of the years until 2027 (WSP’s revenue and net revenue were $16,166.8 million and $12,172.2 million, respectively, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024);

TRC’s net revenue organic growth in line with the last 4-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) revenue growth (TRC revenue and net revenue were approximately US$1,498.9 million and US$1,192.2 million, respectively for the financial year ended June 30, 2025);

TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion supported by a combination of levers, including utilization and pricing, where significant opportunity has been identified;

Expected cost synergies of the Acquisition being fully realized by the end of 2027, with 50% expected to be realized in the first 12 months after closing of the Acquisition.

Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition:

The Acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive upon closing, excluding synergies.

WSP’s net revenue organic growth of approximately the same level as the average of the last three years for each of the years until 2027 (WSP’s revenue and net revenue were $16,166.8 million and $12,172.2 million, respectively, for the financial year ended December 31, 2024);

TRC’s net revenue organic growth in line with the last 4-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) revenue growth (TRC revenue and net revenue were approximately US$1,498.9 million and US$1,192.2 million, respectively for the financial year ended June 30, 2025);

TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion supported by a combination of levers, including utilization and pricing, where significant opportunity has been identified.

TRC Pre-IFRS-16 Adjusted EBITDA and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA:

TRC high single digit revenue organic growth for the financial year ending December 31, 2026, in line with TRC’s actual performance for the last four years.

TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion supported by a combination of levers, including utilization and pricing, where significant opportunity has been identified;

WSP’s Pro Forma Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio (upon closing of the Acquisition, and a targeted range within 12 months following closing of the Acquisition):

Acquisition closing date assumed to be March 28, 2026;

WSP’s Adjusted EBITDA2 for the financial year ending December 31, 2025 ranging from $2.54 billion to $2.56 billion10 ;

TRC’s Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ending June 30, 2026 being in line with TRC’s actual performance of the first 3 months of the financial year ending June 30, 2026;

All elements of WSP’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the applicable period being in line with those generally experienced by WSP in comparable periods;

WSP’s net revenue between $13.8 billion and $14.0 billion for the financial year ending December 31, 2025 (WSP’s net revenue was $12,172.2 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2024, and WSP’s revenue was $16,166.8 million for the financial year ended December 31, 2024); and

Cash flow of TRC for the financial year ending June 30, 2026 being in line with TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the first 3 months of the financial year ending June 30, 2026.

NON-IFRS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES

The Corporation reports its financial results in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 Interim Financial Reporting. WSP uses a number of financial measures when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. Some of these financial measures are not calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards Accounting Standards (""IFRS""). Regulation 52-112 respecting Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure prescribes disclosure requirements that apply to the following types of measures used by the Corporation: (i) non-IFRS financial measures; (ii) non-IFRS ratios; (iii) total of segments measures; (iv) capital management measures; and (v) supplementary financial measures.

In this document, the following non-IFRS and other financial measures may be used by the Corporation: 2027 Accretion; Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition; Net Revenues; Net Revenue Organic Growth, Adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted Net Earnings; Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share; and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio. Other than in respect of 2027 Accretion and Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition which are each defined below, explanations of the composition and usefulness of these measures can be found in section 19, “Glossary of segment reporting measures, non-IFRS and other financial measures” of WSP’s MD&A for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 27, 2025 (the “Q3 2025 MD&A”), which section is incorporated by reference in this document, as posted on WSP’s website at www.wsp.com, and filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Reconciliations of such measures to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS are provided in section 8, “Financial Review” and section 9, “Liquidity” in each of WSP's MD&A for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 29, 2024, WSP’s MD&A for the third quarter and nine-month period ended September 28, 2024, WSP’s MD&A for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, WSP’s MD&A for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 28, 2025 and in the Q3 2025 MD&A, which sections are also incorporated by reference in this document, as posted on WSP’s website at www.wsp.com, and filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

The information in this document also includes non-U.S. GAAP financial measures and non-U.S. GAAP financial ratios with respect to TRC, namely TRC Net Revenues, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin. These measures are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, including WSP’s. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement U.S. GAAP measures by providing further understanding of TRC’s results of operations. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of TRC’s financial statements reported under U.S. GAAP. WSP discloses TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA because this non-U.S. GAAP measure is a key measure used by TRC to evaluate its business, measure its operating performance and make strategic decisions. WSP believes TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operations results in the same manner as TRC. However, TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, income before income taxes, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Using this non-U.S. GAAP financial measure to analyze TRC’s business would have material limitations because the calculations are based on the subjective determination of Management regarding the nature and classification of events and circumstances that investors may find significant. In addition, although other companies in its industry may report measures titled adjusted EBITDA or similar measures, such non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from how TRC calculates non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, which reduces their overall usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, you should consider these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including net income and TRC’s other financial results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

These measures are defined as follows:

""TRC Net Revenues” has the same definition as WSP’s definition of “net revenues,” being revenues less direct costs for subconsultants and other direct expenses that are recoverable directly from clients.

“TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as TRC earnings before net interest and income taxes, excluding depreciation, amortization and acquisition and integration expenses and unusual items.

“TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as the TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for operating lease costs.

“TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as the TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, divided by TRC Net Revenues.

“TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as the TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, divided by TRC Net Revenues.

“2027 Accretion” or “accretive” is calculated as the increase in WSP’s forecasted pro forma adjusted net earnings per share for the financial year ending December 31, 2027 after giving effect to the Acquisition, the Offering, the Concurrent Private Placement, advances and funds expected to be drawn under the Committed Acquisition Financing and any Acquisition-related adjustments, as if it had been completed on January 1, 2027, as compared to WSP’s forecasted adjusted net earnings per share for the financial year ending December 31, 2027 on a stand-alone basis. Refer to “Additional Underlying Assumptions” in this document.

“Accretion Upon Closing of the Acquisition” is calculated as the increase in WSP’s forecasted pro forma adjusted net earnings per share immediately after giving effect to the Acquisition, the Offering, the Concurrent Private Placement, advances and funds expected to be drawn under the Committed Acquisition Financing and any Acquisition-related adjustments, as compared to WSP’s forecasted adjusted net earnings per share on a stand-alone basis. Refer to “Additional Underlying Assumptions” in this document.

A reconciliation of TRC earnings before net interest and income tax to TRC Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and TRC Post-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the financial year ended June 30, 2025, is provided in the table below:

A reconciliation of TRC Revenues to TRC Net Revenues for the financial year ended June 30, 2025, is provided in the table below:

A reconciliation of WSP’s Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended September 27, 2025 for WSP and financial year ended June 30, 2025 for TRC, is provided in the table below:

A reconciliation of WSP’s Pro Forma Net Revenues for the trailing twelve months ended June 28, 2025 for WSP and financial year ended June 30, 2025 for TRC, is provided in the table below:

A reconciliation of WSP’s Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months ended June 28, 2025 for WSP and financial year ended June 30, 2025 for TRC, is provided in the table below:

The non-IFRS and other financial measures used in this document do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS. Management of the Corporation believes that these non-IFRS and other financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation and the other entities referenced herein as they provide additional key metrics of their performance. Refer to section 19 “Glossary of segment reporting, non-IFRS and other financial measures” of the Q3 2025 MD&A for more information on the usefulness to investors of each such measures. These non-IFRS and other financial measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meanings prescribed under IFRS and may differ from similar computations as reported by other issuers, and accordingly may not be comparable. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to “$” in this document are to Canadian dollars and all references to “US$” refer to United States dollars. Where financial information of TRC has been converted from U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars for purposes of comparison to and combination with, financial information of WSP, U.S. dollars have been converted to Canadian dollars at an exchange rate of $1.3952 Canadian dollars per US$1.00.

TRC’s financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). IFRS differs in certain material respects from U.S. GAAP. The financial information of TRC presented in this document has not been adjusted to give effect to the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS or to accounting policies that comply with IFRS and as applied by WSP, nor has such financial information been conformed from accounting principles under U.S. GAAP to IFRS as issued by the IASB, and thus may not be directly comparable to WSP’s financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS. We have assessed the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for TRC and have determined the impact to be immaterial except for Lease Accounting. Under IFRS, Lease Accounting is governed by IFRS 16 while under U.S. GAAP, it is governed by Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842. While similar with regards to the recognition of leases on the balance sheet, the standards have many differences in application. However, the impact of the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS for Lease Accounting on the pro forma financial measures presented in this document, namely WSP Pro Forma Net Revenue and WSP Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, is immaterial, such that no adjustments would be necessary.

WSP’s financial information for the trailing 12-month period ended June 28, 2025 presented herein has been derived by adding WSP’s unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the six-month period ended June 28, 2025 to its audited consolidated financial information for the financial year ended December 31, 2024, and subtracting its unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the six-month period ended June 29, 2024. WSP’s financial information for the trailing 12-month period ended September 27, 2025, presented herein has been derived by adding WSP’s unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine-month period ended September 27, 2025 to its audited consolidated financial information for financial year ended December 31, 2024, and subtracting its unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024.

The move reflects a more cautious approach to pure electric vehicles amid softer-than-expected demand, rising costs, and shifting regulatory dynamics, even as Ford maintains its long-term electrification ambitions. By 2030, the automaker expects about half of its global vehicle volume to come from hybrids, extended-range EVs, and fully electric vehicles, up from roughly 17% today.

Central to the strategy is Ford’s decision to narrow its EV focus to smaller, more affordable models built on a new Universal EV Platform, while expanding its hybrid lineup across nearly its entire portfolio by the end of the decade. The platform’s first model will be a midsize electric pickup, slated for production in 2027 at the Louisville Assembly Plant.

Ford is also reworking its flagship electric truck. The next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift from a fully battery-electric design to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture, combining electric drive with an onboard range-extending power source. The company claims the new Lightning could deliver more than 700 miles of range, addressing customer concerns around towing and long-distance use.

At the same time, Ford is shelving plans for certain larger electric vehicles, including a previously announced electric commercial van for North America, replacing it with a more affordable gas and hybrid van to be built in Ohio.

The strategic reset includes major changes to Ford’s U.S. manufacturing footprint. BlueOval City in Tennessee, initially conceived as a next-generation EV hub, will instead become a truck-focused complex producing new gas-powered pickups starting in 2029. The Ohio Assembly Plant will expand its role as a Ford Pro hub, building new gas and hybrid commercial vans alongside Super Duty chassis cabs.

Ford said these shifts will support thousands of new U.S. jobs over the coming years, reinforcing its emphasis on domestic production at a time when many automakers are reassessing EV investment timelines.

Beyond vehicles, Ford is entering the fast-growing battery energy storage systems market, targeting demand from data centers, utilities, and grid infrastructure. The company plans to repurpose underutilized EV battery capacity at its Kentucky and Michigan facilities to produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and containerized storage systems.

Ford aims to begin shipping BESS products in 2027, ramping up to at least 20 GWh of annual capacity. The automaker plans to invest about $2 billion over the next two years to scale the business, positioning energy storage as a new, diversified revenue stream that leverages its manufacturing and battery expertise.

The move comes as soaring power demand from artificial intelligence-driven data centers and grid reliability concerns accelerate investment in large-scale storage across the U.S.

The strategy overhaul comes with a significant accounting hit. Ford expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items related mainly to U.S. EV assets and product cancellations, with roughly $5.5 billion in associated cash costs spread across 2026 and 2027.

Despite the charges, Ford raised its 2025 adjusted EBIT guidance to about $7 billion, citing underlying business strength and cost improvements. Adjusted free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion was reaffirmed, trending toward the upper end of the range.

Ford’s EV unit, Model e, is now expected to reach profitability by 2029, with incremental margin improvements beginning in 2026, while Ford Pro and Ford Blue are also expected to benefit from the capital reallocation.

Ford’s pivot mirrors a broader recalibration underway across the global auto industry, as automakers temper aggressive EV rollouts in favor of hybrids and flexible powertrain strategies. High interest rates, uneven charging infrastructure, and slowing EV adoption in key markets have forced manufacturers to prioritize near-term returns and operational resilience.

By doubling down on its core strengths—trucks, vans, hybrids, and manufacturing scale—Ford is betting that a more pragmatic electrification path will deliver steadier profits while keeping it positioned for a lower-carbon future.

Gov. Henry McMaster and South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) Director Myra Reece have unveiled an updated South Carolina State Water Plan.

Developed at the governor's direction by SCDES and the WaterSC Water Resources Working Group and other key contributors from across the state, the updated plan focuses on the sustainable management of water resources as South Carolina experiences record-breaking economic and population growth.

""South Carolina's booming population and record-breaking economic development have brought new demands on our water system, and it is our responsibility to ensure our water resources remain secure,"" McMaster said. ""This updated State Water Plan provides a clear, long-term strategy for maintaining reliable water supplies over the next 50 years.”

McMaster added, “I am confident in the work SCDES and WaterSC have done to ensure South Carolina is prepared to meet the demands of today and tomorrow.""

To help ensure water resources are managed in the best interest of all South Carolinians, McMaster proactively established WaterSC in September 2024 to unite key stakeholders — including those from farming and agriculture, public drinking water, energy, industry, tourism, forestry, conservation, academia, and more — to provide necessary input to the state’s water plan.

The executive order that established WaterSC required SCDES to submit an updated State Water Plan to the Governor’s Office by Dec. 31, 2025 — a goal the agency achieved on Dec. 11 and announced with McMaster at the Statehouse.

The plan is available at des.sc.gov/WaterSC.

The State Water Plan is a data-driven report that captures input from WaterSC participants and other key stakeholders. It focuses on topics such as water demand by sector, water availability assessments, drought response preparations, and conceptual considerations for water policies.

The plan focuses on ensuring water availability for all water users for the next 50 years.

Key takeaways and concepts of the plan are summarized in Our Water Future: The Leadership Guide to South Carolina’s Water Plan.

""The updated State Water Plan isn’t just a report — it’s a roadmap that prepares us for growth, protects us in times of drought, and safeguards the water resources that sustain our way of life,"" Reece said.

Reece added, ""While South Carolina’s water resources are abundant, they are not limitless. If we continue to plan wisely and collaboratively, we will have the water we need to support our residents and economy for generations to come.""

This is the third version of the South Carolina State Water Plan. The previous two versions, developed in 1998 and updated in 2004, were written by the S.C. Department of Natural Resources (DNR), which was responsible for water planning activities prior to the establishment of SCDES in 2024.

The state’s eight River Basin Councils contributed data, technical analysis, and modeling to support the updated plan.

Additionally, considerable input was received during the public comment period for the draft water plan, all of which was reviewed by water plan development staff.

As part of the planning process, six public listening sessions were held throughout the state over the past several months to engage and inform residents about the importance of water planning and sustainable use.

Said Reece: ""While we achieved this important milestone for sustainable water use and protection, there is still work to be done as more and more people and businesses call South Carolina home. Our work to protect South Carolina’s water resources will continue.""

Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc. (Nasdaq: GREE), a vertically integrated cryptocurrency data center and power generation company, announced Dec. 11, 2025, the closing of the sale of its 152-acre property located in Spartanburg, South Carolina, to an affiliate of The Lightstone Group and LightHouse Data Centers.

The consideration for the transaction consists of $18 million in cash at closing (subject to upward adjustment) and the right to receive up to $18 million in additional earnout payments.

The earnout payments are payable at $180,000 per megawatt (MW) of power capacity made available to the property before 2031, to the extent such capacity exceeds the 60 MW Greenidge previously secured for delivery by September 2026.

Said Jordan Kovler, chief executive officer of Greenidge: “The sale of our South Carolina property validates our disciplined playbook of identifying overlooked, low-cost power assets, maximizing their capacity, and monetizing them at the optimal time. This is the same playbook driving progress on our Mississippi expansion site, where 40 megawatts are expected to be available by March 2027.”

Kovler added, “By delivering substantial, immediate liquidity while retaining meaningful upside, we are diversifying our revenue streams, optimizing every megawatt under our control, and creating lasting value for shareholders.”

Over the past year, Greenidge has reduced the principal on its 2026 senior indebtedness to approximately $37.8 million through a series of public and privately negotiated tender and exchange offers.

Through divesting non-core assets, Greenidge has raised approximately $22.1 million in cash, inclusive of approximately $17.9 million in net proceeds from this transaction.

With existing cash and bitcoin holdings of approximately $9.8 million as of Nov. 30, 2025, Greenidge’s pro forma net debt has improved to approximately $12.4 million, from $52.9 million at the beginning of the year.

The Greenville Chamber released its 2026 Public Policy Agenda on Dec. 12, 2025, at the Annual Legislative Breakfast, outlining priorities of the Greenville business community for Greenville County and the state of South Carolina.

According to Greenville Chamber President/CEO, Carlos Phillips, “The Greenville Chamber’s 2026 Public Policy Agenda reflects our continued commitment to advancing bold, practical policies that drive shared economic prosperity.”

The Greenville Chamber's 2026 agenda prioritizes forward-looking, balanced solutions that strengthen South Carolina’s economic competitiveness and enhance quality of life for current and future residents.

Key statewide priorities include strengthening workforce participation by expanding access to affordable dependent care; improving transportation infrastructure; encouraging responsible growth through smart planning and targeted investment; expanding access to affordable housing; and improving the state’s insurance climate through predictable and fair legal frameworks.

Chamber officials said they will also continue to advocate for its core policy pillars, including tort reform, protecting the rights of private businesses, securing reliable tourism funding, advancing sustainable land use, promoting equitable and competitive tax policies, and expanding licensing access for individuals with valid work authorization.

Locally, the officials said, the Chamber remains focused on preparing Greenville for continued population growth by supporting affordable housing initiatives, encouraging incentives for mixed-use and commercial development, and advancing zoning updates that promote responsible, future-focused growth.

The officials said the agenda reflects the shared priorities of thousands of founders, entrepreneurs, and employers throughout Greenville County and across the Upstate, developed in partnership with 13 regional chamber partners through the Upstate Chamber Coalition.

The agenda-setting process included a fall survey, industry roundtables, and collaboration with chambers and business organizations across the region.

The Annual Legislative Breakfast is the Greenville Chamber’s premier legislative event, attended by more than 250 business and political leaders.

The Greenville Chamber also recognized legislators whose voting record reflected alignment with Greenville Chamber policy positions.

“2025 Business Guardians,” defined as voting for Greenville Chamber agenda items (when voting) at 100 percent included Sens. Thomas Alexander, Tom Corbin, Jason Elliott, Mike Gambrell, Billy Garrett, Josh Kimbrell, Ross Turner and Danny Verdin, as well as Reps. Neal Collins and Scott Montgomery.

During the event, the Greenville Chamber emphasized the importance of pairing private-sector leadership with effective public policy and reaffirmed its commitment to convening corporate partners, universities, and nonprofit organizations to address Greenville’s most pressing needs.

The Chamber also reiterated its focus on accelerating economic mobility by supporting measures that ensure all people and businesses have opportunities to achieve economic prosperity.

New York Finalizes Mandatory GHG Reporting Rule for Large Emitters Starting 2027

New York has finalized new regulations requiring mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting for major emitters beginning in 2027, according to DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton. The move comes as the Trump administration works to dismantle federal climate transparency programs, including ending the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and blocking the SEC’s climate disclosure rules.

The new mandate follows Governor Kathy Hochul’s directive to establish a statewide reporting system to identify major polluters, support emissions-reduction policies and help track progress toward climate goals. Facilities emitting 10,000 metric tons of CO₂e annually — including power plants, landfills, waste-to-energy sites, natural gas infrastructure, petroleum and fuel suppliers, agricultural operations and waste transporters — must report data to the DEC each year.

Some large sources will also be required to obtain third-party verification. DEC received over 3,000 public comments during consultation and made adjustments such as easing early-year verification deadlines. Lefton said the program is “critical” to protecting public health and the environment.

UK Conservatives Plan to End 2030 Petrol and Diesel Car Ban

The UK Conservative party has said it would scrap the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and end the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which legally requires carmakers to sell a rising share of electric vehicles — reaching 80% of new cars by 2030 and 100% by 2035.

Party leader Kemi Badenoch argued the rules are too costly for families and manufacturers, and said removing non-R&D subsidies would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Labour, however, recently reinstated the 2035 zero-emission target, saying it provides clarity to consumers and industry.

Environmental groups including Greenpeace UK warned that reversing EV policies now would confuse the market, risk jobs and push the UK behind faster-moving competitors such as China.

The government responded that it still plans to phase out all new non-zero-emission cars and vans by 2035, and highlighted £7.5bn in funding to support the shift to electric vehicles.

Amazon Rainforest Could Shift Into ‘Hypertropical’ Climate by 2100, Scientists Warn

A new Nature study led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley warns that the Amazon may enter a “hypertropical” climate by 2100 — a hotter, drier and more unstable state not seen on Earth for at least 10 million years. The team found the region could experience up to 150 days of “hot drought” conditions each year without major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

Using 30 years of temperature, humidity, soil moisture and light data from research plots north of Manaus, scientists observed how trees struggle during extreme heat: shutting leaf pores, losing carbon-absorption capacity, and developing sap embolisms that block water flow. Fast-growing, low wood-density species — common in secondary forests — were especially vulnerable.

Tree mortality could rise from just above 1% today to 1.55% by 2100, a massive loss across the world’s largest rainforest. A weakened Amazon carbon sink could accelerate global warming and pose similar risks to tropical forests in West Africa and Southeast Asia.

""But they also demand affordability … rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.""

The Lightning's design evolved from what was once a gas-powered truck. And now it will come full circle; an upcoming plug-in hybrid version of the truck will once again have a gasoline engine, in the form of a generator that will allow the vehicle to keep driving even if the battery runs out of juice. The all-electric Lightning is dead; the extended-range Lightning is on its way.

The all-electric F-150 Lightning was a big deal to Ford. It was announced in 2021 with great fanfare and an appealingly low price of just $40,000. But once it actually hit production lines, Ford was never able to sell it for anything close to the promised price tag; the 2025 model started at around $55,000.

The truck was designed to appeal to mainstream truck enthusiasts, with no quirky EV styling. It came festooned with outlets everywhere, leveraging the onboard battery so drivers could run tools at a worksite, power appliances at a tailgate party and even run their house on it, using it like a generator during a power outage.

The Lightning won 2023 Truck of the Year from Motortrend, unanimously, and from the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards. It was Kelley Blue Book's top pick for electric trucks in 2024. And it was the best-selling electric truck in America last quarter, Ford says.

But that category as a whole was struggling, as electric pickups failed to live up to lofty expectations — for performance and affordability, and as a result, for sales. The Lightning, in particular, struggled with reliability. Shoppers were turned off by its limited range when towing; why buy a truck that can't do truck stuff?

And, more to the point, Ford lost money on every vehicle, even at the higher-than-promised price point. EV sales have been lower than automakers had expected in the past few years. Production costs didn't come down as much as Ford had hoped.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pulled a 180 on EV policy, eliminating incentives and requirements that pushed buyers and automakers alike toward electric vehicles.

That includes stripping away a $7,500 tax credit that had made some EVs more affordable, and removing emissions and fuel economy standards that gave Ford — among other EV makers — an incentive to keep unprofitable vehicles in production. Those rules, which required automakers to make their new vehicle fleets cleaner, on average, over time, are being dialed down — which means automakers can make more big gas- and diesel-powered trucks and fewer EVs without running afoul of federal regulations.

Frick said that ""changes in the regulatory environment"" were part of the ""entire landscape"" that pushed Ford to discontinue the vehicle and work on the extended-range version instead.

Meanwhile, Ford's all-electric ambitions will be smaller — literally, with more compact and affordable vehicles at the heart of the company's EV plans, starting with the midsize pickup truck the company announced in August. Ford is targeting a price point of $30,000 and expects to roll them out roughly a year from now.

The change in plans will cost Ford billions of dollars in write-offs and cash this year, but the company says it will make up for it by replacing a money-losing vehicle with ones it hopes will be profitable.

The pivot also leaves Ford with far more battery production capacity than it needs, since the company had invested heavily to build battery factories to supply the EV production lines that it's now idling.

So it announced a new line of business: Ford will be revamping a battery production site in Kentucky to build batteries for stationary storage instead of for trucks. Those batteries can be sold to balance the electric grid — batteries can charge up when electricity is cheap, like when wind and solar are abundant, and discharge it when electricity is scarce, a phenomenon that's already reshaping the electric grids in California and Texas.

They'll also be sold to data centers and other industrial customers, Ford says.

Each can be accessed using the links above. Key takeaways from the RA Study include the following:

There are resource adequacy challenges in PJM and MISO which are likely to affect the costs and reliability of electricity supply for Illinois businesses and consumers.

There are pathways for Illinois to achieve its climate goals in the electricity sector while ensuring a reliable electric grid, using available commercialized technologies.

Illinois has the responsibility, authority, and policy tools to conduct planning, identify solutions, and support implementing actions to address these challenges.

Upcoming Releases and Stakeholder Engagement

In addition to the release of the comprehensive RA Study Report, the Agencies will also publish a comprehensive set of data files on December 22, providing the underlying inputs, assumptions, and modeling datasets used to produce the Resource Adequacy Study results. These materials will be available on the Resource Adequacy Study web page, organized into a dedicated section for stakeholders to access and download.

The Agencies will host a stakeholder workshop in late January 2026 presenting the findings of the Resource Adequacy Study. That workshop will also outline next steps in support of the next phases of the study as defined in Section 9.15(o) of the IEPA Act, including the process and timeline associated with the development of a mitigation plan. Following the workshop, the Agencies will open a new request for stakeholder feedback.

Additionally, recently-passed Senate Bill 25 directs the Illinois Commerce Commission (in consultation with the IPA and other agencies) to develop a comprehensive Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) that “addresses any resource adequacy challenges in the 5 years immediately following approval of the plan, while also taking into account the 10 years following the plan.” To facilitate solutions, the ICC may “order changes to existing programs, direct specific actions within existing programs including the authorization to support the expansion of an existing program.” Because the activities associated with the RA Study and the IRP are so closely linked, the Resource Adequacy Study provides a foundational analysis that will feed into and support IRP development throughout 2026.",,N,,2025-12-15 23:59:00.762744

The Bureau of Labor Statistics' most recent consumer price index (CPI) report showed that in September, electricity prices were up 5.1% compared with a year ago despite decreasing by 0.5% on a monthly basis.

Rising demand for electricity from data centers used to power artificial intelligence (AI) tools has contributed to the increase in electricity prices, which has prompted a push to increase the supply of energy from a variety of sources.

""But the electricity sector is a big, complicated machine that, for four years, the Biden administration shut down coal plants, shut down natural gas plants.

So why are investors still showing a belief in Texas?
Colin Sherman, director of hospitality market analytics, Texas & U.S. South for CoStar, said history is driving their decisions.
“From what I can gather, particularly in the Texas landscape, they're looking at the historical fundamentals of hotel investment,” Sherman said.
The Dallas market, in particular, has a lot of new supply coming in, particularly on the luxury side.","NATIONAL REPORT — A challenging RevPAR environment for the top four cities in Texas hasn’t kept hotel investors away from the Lone Star State. In fact, the opposite is true.

“Institutional full-service will continue to be extremely attractive for investors in Texas, really, across the four major cities,” said Brian Nordahl, executive vice president for CBRE Hotels, who is based in Dallas and specializes in institutional investment in Texas and the South Central U.S. “It’s really these national level uncertainties that are impacting the markets, and once we get some clarity on that, I absolutely anticipate that Texas will continue to be the number one place that people are going to look for a hotel investment.”

According to data from CoStar, the top five markets in Texas (which includes Austin, Houston, San Antonio and Dallas as well as Fort Worth-Arlington in DFW market) are seeing negative RevPAR performance through the first three quarters of 2025: Austin is down 6.3% year-over-year, Dallas is down 1.5%, Fort Worth/Arlington is down 0.8%, Houston is down 9.6% and San Antonio is down 3.6%.

Add to that a challenging environment where both the Austin and Dallas markets have closed their convention centers for renovations for the next few years (Austin’s convention center closed in April for a $1.6 billion development with demolition complete and construction underway for a new larger facility while Dallas’ Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center isn’t fully closed but is undergoing a major $3.7 billion renovation/redevelopment that has limited its ability to host events). Both convention centers are scheduled to reopen in 2029.

So why are investors still showing a belief in Texas? Colin Sherman, director of hospitality market analytics, Texas & U.S. South for CoStar, said history is driving their decisions.

“From what I can gather, particularly in the Texas landscape, they're looking at the historical fundamentals of hotel investment,” Sherman said. “Yes, this year is down… But in the long run, they see that there's an opportunity and they continue to maintain that optimism.”

Those strong fundamentals are also showing up in Texas hotel sales data for 2025, Sherman said.

“If we're not even looking at development, but just sales in general, we've seen an uptick in sales this year across the five major metros that STR follows,” he said. “We're starting to see investments come back.”

Through November across those five markets, Sherman said STR data shows that 18,570 rooms have changed hands, up a whopping 45% from 12,794 rooms through the same period last year.

“It's gone up quite a bit and that's a good indicator that investors are still willing to buy and buyers are looking for deals,” he said. “They're hedging their bets, basically, that everything is going to be back and it's still a good investment, considering the growth and the population that's coming to all major metros around Texas.”

The strongest hotel investment market in Texas also has the nation’s strongest hotel pipeline for the past two years, Nordahl said — Dallas-Fort Worth.

“DFW continues to be the number one location for investors nationwide,” Nordahl said. “It's the number one market where people want to be, no matter what's happening with the convention center.”

If anything, Nordahl said, investors look at the buildup to a new convention center in 2029 as a positive.

“Because when you [acquire] them, a lot of these hotels need to be renovated. So you do your renovation over 24 months, and then you're ready to rock and roll when those convention centers come back online, there's significant citywide demand and the hotels will benefit greatly,” he said. “Most of these investors are underwriting five to 10-year return horizons, so it falls well within those horizons to have new convention centers.”

Challenges for Texas markets

Each of the top four cities is facing unique challenges.

In Austin, the city is facing RevPAR headwinds, especially in the last two quarters (Q2 RevPAR was down 14.3% YOY, and Q3 was off 6.3%), and is focusing on what it calls a “mini-wide” concept to host events (namely, SXSW) while its convention center is closed.

“They’re turning their downtown into a campus-style, convention center, where they're using all the available meeting spaces around different hotels to fill that gap,” Sherman said.

While the city has long been known as a luxury market, developers have recently been working to fill the middle-tier hotel gap, according to Sherman.

“That middle-tier traveler is what they're trying to appeal to now, and developers are trying to fill that gap throughout the Austin area, not just in downtown, but also in some of the peripheral submarkets,” he said.

The RevPAR challenges are less apparent in Dallas-Fort Worth, which has the two best-performing major markets in Texas. The Dallas market, in particular, has a lot of new supply coming in, particularly on the luxury side. Those luxury hotels are unique, Sherman said, because they are often anchoring mixed-use developments around the city (while it’s more typical for the hotels to come in later in the development process).

The Arlington-Fort Worth market has benefited from steady demand and new supply and is especially buoyed by all the sports demand created in Arlington with the NFL, baseball and special events, notably next year’s World Cup, when Arlington will host nine matches at AT&T Stadium, the most of any host city.

Nordahl said several submarkets in DFW aside from Arlington will benefit from the event, including Frisco, as well as hotels around DFW Airport.

“We've heard advanced bookings that are extremely strong at individual hotels,” he said. “[Next year] should be a great year in particular and a great summer for DFW as a whole,” he said.

Houston’s RevPAR headwinds are more notable, but mainly because of challenging comps due to 2024 hurricane (RevPAR was down 25.1% YOY in Q3). Sherman said that, with little new supply entering the market, the investment focus has shifted away from the city’s urban core.

“From an investor standpoint, we're seeing those peripheral submarkets being filled more on the entertainment side and a little bit further outside of downtown,” he said.

San Antonio has also seen RevPAR headwinds this year (Q1 was down 3.7% — the only major market to be down in the first quarter; Q2 was down 3.3%; and Q3 was down 3.4%) due to steady supply growth offset by lower demand. But Sherman said there’s a lot to look forward to in the market with several upper-tier hotels opening in the downtown area over the past year.

“A lot of supply has entered the market, particularly on that luxury scale,” he said. “A lot is going on down there, and it's being driven by new projects that the city and independent developers are bringing to the city,” he said, noting the significance of Project Marvel, an ambitious, multi-billion downtown revitalization plan.

Speaking to investor interest is all of the potential future demand for business in these markets, especially when the Austin and Dallas convention centers fully come back online. Those citywide events create compression, Nordahl said, which can spread the benefits to hotels around the city.

“The big word that matters is compression… even if your hotel is not benefiting directly from convention center demand, the fact that there's a major event citywide or even a large group creates that compression in the market that allows various hotels that might benefit from getting better occupancy and better average daily rate,” he said.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/HIT/uploadedImages/Articles/News_Articles/Development/Owners/New%20Austin%20Convention%20Center.png?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-15 22:00:44.597785

Data centers drive overall growth Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield.
“The increase in air conditioning should not be used to assign investments made to serve data centers to residential customers.
We should directly assign data center costs to data centers,” Jenks said.
“Both the PUC Staff and CUB have advocated direct assignment when a cost is incurred primarily to serve data centers,” he said, “and that the direct assignment lasts until there is evidence that the asset is no longer primarily serving data centers.”","The company doesn’t plan to simply assign the costs of energy investments needed to support data centers, to data centers, but to focus on all drivers of “peak demand”

Oregon’s largest electrical utility is proposing to make residential customers pay at least part of the long-term cost of supplying large data centers, despite a new law requiring it to charge the centers’ developers, not other customers.

This summer, Oregon became one of just a few states to pass a law requiring data centers to foot the costs of growing energy and transmission infrastructure that’s needed to power them.

The POWER Act mandated Oregon’s three monopoly electric utilities create a separate rate class for data centers to ensure residential customers and other medium and industrial customers weren’t subsidizing the new costs associated with the data centers’ anomalous growth.

But months after the law passed, a plan to comply with the new law from Oregon’s largest electric utility — Portland General Electric — reveals the company could be trying to find a work-around that would only directly charge data centers for the first three years of costs associated with a typical 50-year infrastructure investment.

Residential customers and other customers would help pay for the rest over the remaining 47 years.

Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens’ Utility Board, said PGE’s plan invokes a “twisted logic” to try and skirt the new law. The utilities’ watchdog group was established by Oregon voters in 1984 to represent the interests of the state’s consumers who are captive to the monopoly utilities.

PGE Spokesperson Drew Hanson says it will ensure all customers “pay their fair share of system costs.”

The three-member Oregon Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a decision on PGE’s plan at the end of April.

Data centers drive overall growth

Oregon’s data center market is the fifth largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and X, formerly named Twitter, have massive data centers in eastern Oregon as well as in The Dalles, Hillsboro and Prineville that require enormous amounts of energy to operate.

Between 2013 and 2023, Oregon’s overall electricity consumption rose by more than 20%, the analysis found, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

“Data centers undoubtedly drove a major share, if not almost all, of this growth,” analysts wrote.

PGE serves 930,000 customers, and absorbed the most data center load growth of any private utility in the state during the last decade, according to that analysis.

The company also raised residential rates 50% during the last five years in part to pay for system upgrades and growth.

As a customer class, residential users’ demand on PGE’s system has grown by about 1% a year during that last ten years, or about 10% in the last decade. Demand from the class of customers that data centers fall into — the class for the largest industrial users of power — demand grew nearly 70% during that same period.

The plan

In its plan to comply with the POWER Act, PGE proposes a new tool for figuring out who pays for new infrastructure meant to meet growing demand called the “Peak Growth Modifier.”

For the first three years of a new infrastructure investment — typically spread out over 50 years — the user driving overall system growth would be assigned the bulk of costs of a new investment. That means for the first three years, data centers would likely pay.

After three years, the remaining costs would roll back into PGE’s historic pricing method, which spreads those infrastructure costs across all customers based not just on how much they drive overall demand growth on the system, but how much they drive growth in “peak demand.”

Expanding and updating the electric grid and connecting it to new energy resources is meant to make sure customers are reliably served, “at moments when usage is at its highest point,” PGE spokesperson Drew Hanson said in an email.

That is: demand that peaks in moments when it’s really cold or really warm and heat and air conditioners are turned on. Each customer class is charged by the proportion of energy they require during the highest demand hour each month.

Though residential users have contributed to roughly 10% of the total new load growth to the system during the last decade they’ve contributed to 42% of the peak load demand growth during that decade. That’s in part because there are just way more residential customers than there are in any other customer class, Hanson said.

Directly assigning costs

Jenks acknowledged that PGE’s residential customers have caused energy demand to spike during hot summer days due to air conditioning, but winter peaks have declined in recent years due to the growing use of energy efficient heat pumps.

“The increase in air conditioning should not be used to assign investments made to serve data centers to residential customers. We should directly assign data center costs to data centers,” Jenks said.

Jenks used the example of PGE’s recent Hillsboro Reliability Project, a transmission project bringing a lot of power to new data centers. Jenks said the publicly available estimates put the cost at about $210 million.

Demand for the project came mostly from data centers and high-tech facilities such as semiconductor chip manufacturers like Intel, Jenks said. And under the Peak Growth Modifier, those companies would pay most for the first three years of the costs of the project.

But, residential customers would be chipping in a large share of the remaining costs of that project over the next 47 years, since they are considered significant “peak demand” drivers on the system.

Hanson said the Hillsboro project was not just meant to meet new demand from data centers, industrial manufacturing and high-tech businesses in the area, but also residential expansion. He did not, however, provide details about which of those energy users drove most of the demand.

“These projects serve the overall electricity needs of Hillsboro and surrounding communities,” he said.

The growth modifier, at the end of the day, will result in data centers paying more for their growing energy needs than they currently do, he said. The company remains flexible to Peak Growth Modifier tweaks, including charging data centers for more than the first three years of a new large infrastructure project meant to serve them.

Jenks countered that PGE should just do what PUC staff and the Citizens’ Utility Board have asked them to do in previous rate cases when discussions about data center demand have come up.

“Both the PUC Staff and CUB have advocated direct assignment when a cost is incurred primarily to serve data centers,” he said, “and that the direct assignment lasts until there is evidence that the asset is no longer primarily serving data centers.”",https://beavertonvalleytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/12/QTS-Data-Centers-in-Hillsboro-on-Oct.-11-2024.-Despite-data-centers-driving-overall-system-dema.jpg?w=729,N,,2025-12-16 02:58:08.559612

TXNM officials said Monday that its Texas arm, Texas-New Mexico Power Co., had agreed to terms with local stakeholders, including Walmart Inc., Public Utility Commission of Texas staff, Texas Industrial Energy Consumers, the Office of Public Utility Counsel, Texas Energy Association for Marketers and the cities it serves.

The settlement agreement means hearings that were scheduled to begin Monday have been canceled, and Texas regulators will make a final decision on the sale of TXNM to Blackstone as early as next month, a TXNM spokesperson said.

The news comes as a big win for TXNM and Blackstone, which filed their applications with Texas, New Mexico and federal regulators in August to sell the Albuquerque-based company to the private equity firm for $11.5 billion.

Texas-New Mexico Power serves some 260,000 customers across the state, including in towns near Dallas and Houston. But its New Mexico arm Public Service Company of New Mexico, or PNM, serves over 550,000 customers, making it by far the largest electric utility in the state.

On Monday, Blackstone and TXNM also filed the proposed sale with additional regulatory bodies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, the spokesperson said.

TXNM and Blackstone still need to file with the Federal Communications Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

The deal has not yet received any regulatory approvals, but an OK from the Public Utility Commission of Texas looks likely to be the first.

In the settlement agreement announced Monday, TXNM and Blackstone said Texas-New Mexico Power will provide nearly $46 million in customer rate credits over four years for its Texas customers, not reduce wages or implement workforce reductions, and “not seek recovery of transaction-related goodwill or acquisition costs in customer rates.”

Blackstone’s proposed purchase of TXNM recently gained the attention of U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who wrote in a letter to the private equity firm’s CEO earlier this month that the deal isn’t in the public’s best interest.

Ford, which has lost $13 billion on its EV business since 2023, said it would bolster its lineup of gas-powered vehicles while shifting to hybrid and so-called extended-range electric vehicles that include onboard gasoline engines. NEW YORK TIMES, July 25, 2021: “In statements, Toyota said that it was in no way opposed to electric vehicles. We agree and embrace the fact that all-electric vehicles are the future, Eric Booth, a Toyota spokesman, said. But Toyota thinks that too little attention is being paid to what happens between today, when 98 percent of the cars and trucks sold are powered at least in part by gasoline, and that fully electrified future, he said. “Until then, Mr. Booth said, it makes sense for Toyota to lean on its existing hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles to reduce emissions. Hydrogen fuel cell technology should also play a role. And any efficiency standards should be informed by what technology can realistically deliver and help keep vehicles affordable, the company said.” Ford’s Farley only now has come to appreciate what Toyota understood more than four years ago about the market for EVs in America, even when heavily subsidized by U.S. taxpayers. Toyota is having a banner year selling hybrids, which now account for about 50 percent of its fleet and have higher profit margins than gas engine vehicles. To Jim Farley’s credit, he has acknowledged that large, all-electric vehicles in the U.S. market aren’t economically viable and is redeploying capital accordingly. Ford is ending the current all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning and replacing it with an extended-range model, despite the Lightning being the best-selling electric pickup in America. GM’s Mary Barra, who fashions herself as running a technology company, still will not concede that large electric pickups and SUVs were a financial and market misread. Some of GM’s heaviest and most expensive EVs are built at Factory Zero in Detroit. Instead of an adult pivot, GM cut roughly half the plant’s staff after first telling workers the layoffs would be temporary. Speculation is rife among plant workers that GM will ultimately shut it down. It is called Factory Zero because it was meant to embody Barra’s zero-emissions ambition. Volkswagen’s board fired a CEO widely regarded as one of Europe’s strongest over concerns he pushed EVs too aggressively. Stellantis dismissed its CEO after a weak quarter despite that executive’s success integrating a merger. Yet Farley and Barra not only keep their jobs, but they are also paid roughly 80% more than Toyota’s CEO. https://lnkd.in/gV5fMvHx #electricvehicles",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D5627AQHGrFcKdIeBlQ/articleshare-shrink_800/B56Zsj1XvnIYAI-/0/1765832752419?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=yB4I0GEm_za0LNkptYWB4VV5OzfZZTlXnOsDKIpNHgc,N,,2025-12-15 22:59:03.311226

Plus, setting up your desired cabin temperature and scheduling your departure time allows the software to decide what works best.
In short, preconditioning is about more than just a cozy cabin — it improves driving range, prolongs the battery life, and helps with faster charging speeds.","Electric propulsion comes with its fair share of pros and cons. While range anxiety has solutions, as do concerns about charging infrastructure, something else that worries many EV owners is how the driving range is affected when it's cold and wintery.

Not everyone lives in an area suitable for optimal battery output. Extreme weather can take a toll on the power pack, with studies showing up to a 33% drop in EV driving range during winter weather conditions. A significant push forward in terms of battery health and performance came with the introduction of preconditioning, a quality-of-life feature that's fairly common on most modern EVs, like the polarizing 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 6. However, while owners often associate preconditioning with merely warming up the cabin, there's more to it than meets the eye. Put simply, preconditioning is the process of bringing the battery to its ideal temperature range. Not only do you get a cozy interior, but it also ensures that your EV performs properly.

Drivers living in cold climates can benefit from the feature, as it enables the battery pack to operate more efficiently. However, it works the other way around, too — if you live in a hotter climate, the built-in system cools down the battery to enable peak performance.

Batteries are temperature sensitive and have a specific window — usually between 60 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit –in which performance is optimum. Output often fluctuates when temperatures fall below 32 degrees or climb above 113 degrees. Therefore, EVs in colder environments operate better when they're warmed up before setting off.

Most of the time, your EV's thermal management system (TMS) takes care of this automatically, but some marques offer you the option of preconditioning through their dedicated mobile apps. It's advised that you precondition while plugged in, as most modern EVs are designed to draw power from the grid, rather than the battery itself. Plus, setting up your desired cabin temperature and scheduling your departure time allows the software to decide what works best.

Preconditioning is also wise if you're en route to a fast charger. Cold batteries tend to charge slowly. Preconditioning on the go can help improve things, although it comes at the expense of increased battery drain. That said, the loss is offset by shorter wait times at the charging station, as the system does not have to waste time bringing the battery up to temperature.

In short, preconditioning is about more than just a cozy cabin — it improves driving range, prolongs the battery life, and helps with faster charging speeds. As for how long you should precondition, it's better if you leave that for the built-in software to decide. It's a lot smarter than we give it credit for.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/why-preconditioning-your-electric-car-in-winter-is-about-more-than-just-a-warm-cabin/l-intro-1764873967.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 22:00:32.899448

Ford says the move is following customer demand, and reflecting the reality that the all-electric Lightning was a money-loser — and Ford, concluded, it always would be.
The all-electric Lightning is dead; the extended-range Lightning is on its way.
The all-electric F-150 Lightning was a big deal to Ford.
And it was the best-selling electric truck in America last quarter, Ford says.","Ford Motor Company has ceased production of the all-electric F-150 Lightning, its flagship full-size electric pickup, and will focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a future line of smaller, cheaper EVs. Battery plants once intended to supply Ford trucks will now be sending batteries to bolster the electric grid instead.

Ford says the move is following customer demand, and reflecting the reality that the all-electric Lightning was a money-loser — and Ford, concluded, it always would be.

""The American consumer is speaking clearly and they want the benefits of electrification like instant torque and mobile power,"" said Andrew Frick, the president of Ford Blue and Ford model e, the company's commercial and electric divisions. He spoke to reporters on a call on Monday. ""But they also demand affordability … rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas.""

The Lightning's design evolved from what was once a gas-powered truck. And now it will come full circle; an upcoming plug-in hybrid version of the truck will once again have a gasoline engine, in the form of a generator that will allow the vehicle to keep driving even if the battery runs out of juice. The all-electric Lightning is dead; the extended-range Lightning is on its way.

The all-electric F-150 Lightning was a big deal to Ford. It was announced in 2021 with great fanfare and an appealingly low price of just $40,000. But once it actually hit production lines, Ford was never able to sell it for anything close to the promised price tag; the 2025 model started at around $55,000.

The truck was designed to appeal to mainstream truck enthusiasts, with no quirky EV styling. It came festooned with outlets everywhere, leveraging the onboard battery so drivers could run tools at a worksite, power appliances at a tailgate party and even run their house on it, using it like a generator during a power outage.

The Lightning won 2023 Truck of the Year from Motortrend, unanimously, and from the North American Car, Utility and Truck of the Year Awards. It was Kelley Blue Book's top pick for electric trucks in 2024. And it was the best-selling electric truck in America last quarter, Ford says.

But that category as a whole was struggling, as electric pickups failed to live up to lofty expectations — for performance and affordability, and as a result, for sales. The Lightning, in particular, struggled with reliability. Shoppers were turned off by its limited range when towing; why buy a truck that can't do truck stuff?

And, more to the point, Ford lost money on every vehicle, even at the higher-than-promised price point. EV sales have been lower than automakers had expected in the past few years. Production costs didn't come down as much as Ford had hoped.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has pulled a 180 on EV policy, eliminating incentives and requirements that pushed buyers and automakers alike toward electric vehicles.

That includes stripping away a $7,500 tax credit that had made some EVs more affordable, and removing emissions and fuel economy standards that gave Ford — among other EV makers — an incentive to keep unprofitable vehicles in production. Those rules, which required automakers to make their new vehicle fleets cleaner, on average, over time, are being dialed down — which means automakers can make more big gas- and diesel-powered trucks and fewer EVs without running afoul of federal regulations.

Frick said that ""changes in the regulatory environment"" were part of the ""entire landscape"" that pushed Ford to discontinue the vehicle and work on the extended-range version instead.

Meanwhile, Ford's all-electric ambitions will be smaller — literally, with more compact and affordable vehicles at the heart of the company's EV plans, starting with the midsize pickup truck the company announced in August. Ford is targeting a price point of $30,000 and expects to roll them out roughly a year from now.

The change in plans will cost Ford billions of dollars in write-offs and cash this year, but the company says it will make up for it by replacing a money-losing vehicle with ones it hopes will be profitable.

The pivot also leaves Ford with far more battery production capacity than it needs, since the company had invested heavily to build battery factories to supply the EV production lines that it's now idling.

So it announced a new line of business: Ford will be revamping a battery production site in Kentucky to build batteries for stationary storage instead of for trucks. Those batteries can be sold to balance the electric grid — batteries can charge up when electricity is cheap, like when wind and solar are abundant, and discharge it when electricity is scarce, a phenomenon that's already reshaping the electric grids in California and Texas.

They'll also be sold to data centers and other industrial customers, Ford says.

BlueOval SK was not Ford’s only EV venture in Kentucky.","Despite about 1,600 anticipated layoffs at electric vehicle battery maker BlueOval SK, Gov. Andy Beshear said, “Kentucky will remain the EV battery capital of the U.S.”

Ford Motor Co. announced Monday that it will repurpose the facilities at BlueOval SK in Glendale for an energy storage operation. The now defunct joint venture between the automaker and the South Korean battery maker to produce batteries for electric vehicles will be converted to manufacture a special kind of lithium-ion cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot modular data center containers.

Roughly 1,600 people working at BlueOval SK will be laid off in the transition, Ford executive Andrew Frick said Dec. 15. The new energy storage business in Kentucky will have 2,100 employees, about 400 fewer than were anticipated to work at one of two completed facilities in Glendale.

BlueOval SK employees will be given the required 60-day notice of termination required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and will be given the opportunity to reapply for a job with Ford as it starts its new energy storage business.

Beshear said in a statement to the Herald-Leader he and his team were in direct contact with Ford leadership, “working together to ensure the restructured project moves forward and is successful for both the company, Kentucky and our workforce.

“Right now, our primary focus is helping the affected BlueOval employees find new jobs,” Beshear continued. “Team Kentucky is coordinating with company and community leaders to directly support these employees, in addition to planning job fairs and creating a website offering resources.”

Ford’s announcement of it repurposing the facility were shared Dec. 15 along with a series of actions the automaker plans to deploy in the new year to shift to higher-return opportunities for its shareholders, like adding trucks and vans to its vehicle lineup and ending plans to produce large EVs.

The restructuring news came Monday just four days after South Korean battery maker SK On ended its joint venture with Ford for U.S. production of parts for electric vehicles. That joint venture began in 2022 with an initial investment across U.S. facilities of about $11 billion and a promise to employ more than 10,000 people.

The split is the result of slow EV demand, federal tax credits for their purchase sunsetting and federal policy favoring gasoline-powered cars.

“EV is — and will be — part of America’s future despite the President’s shortsighted attacks on the industry,” Beshear said. “We have that same confidence in our longtime partner Ford, which recently invested $2 billion in Louisville’s Assembly Plant to establish production of an electric midsize pickup truck.”

The two businesses, Ford and SK On, began building a nearly $6 billion, 1,500-acre campus in Hardin County in 2022. Two plants, each estimated to employ 2,500 people, are being constructed at the site where batteries were being made to power EVs.

In December 2022, Kentucky economic development officials gave final approval for $250 million in upfront public subsidies in the form of loans that could only be forgiven if the companies hit job and wage targets. The state also spent $25 million establishing a workforce training center at the Elizabethtown Community & Technical College.

As with any company that makes changes to its original incentive agreement, terms for Ford are being renegotiated.

BlueOval SK was not Ford’s only EV venture in Kentucky. In August, the automaker said it would pump $2 billion into its Louisville Assembly Plant for assembly of a new, midsize electric truck and facility expansion to support a universal EV platform.

The company has had a more than 100-year-old history in Kentucky, supplying thousands with jobs and generating millions in economic development dollars and more. In October, Ford looked to its Kentucky Truck Plant to make up for revenue and production volume loss following a fire that temporarily took out its aluminum supplier.

Reps. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, and Steve Bratcher, R-Elizabethtown, said in a joint statement their focus remained on those whose jobs have been impacted and, “that going forward this new project delivers real, lasting investment and meaningful employment for the families and communities surrounding Glendale.”

The two state legislators who represent the area surrounding the BlueOval SK plants said they were “optimistic” about Ford’s takeover of the plant and its transition, especially since the project has faced significant challenges.

“At the same time, optimism must be matched with both caution and accountability, and we will be watching closely to ensure commitments are met and honored,” Heavrin and Bratcher said.

From the other body of the Kentucky General Assembly, Sen. Matt Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, said there will be “short-term challenges” associated with Ford’s transition.

“Ford’s $2 billion commitment to the Glendale facilities, coupled with its expansion of energy-storage battery production to serve a broad range of industrial and utility needs, underscores the company’s long-term commitment to this community,” Deneen said.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/epqg34/picture307305781/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/LEX_02_250527Beshear_rh,N,,2025-12-15 20:58:50.303189

UN says world must jointly tackle issues of climate change, pollution, biodiversity and land loss

TAMMY WEBBER

Associated Press

Published: December 16, 2025

The most comprehensive global environment assessment ever undertaken calls for a new approach to jointly tackle the most pressing environmental issues including climate change and biodiversity loss that threaten over 1 million plant and animal species with extinction.

The U.N. Environment Assembly — which the U.S. government didn't attend — produced the new report this week by almost 300 scientists from 83 countries.

The issues, which also include land degradation and pollution, are inextricably linked and require solutions that include increased spending and financial incentives to transition away from fossil fuels, encourage sustainable agricultural practices, curb pollution and limit waste, the authors of the U.N. Environment Programme's Global Environment Outlook said.

""You can't think of climate change without thinking of biodiversity, land degradation and pollution,"" said Bob Watson, one of the lead authors and a former top NASA and British climate scientist. ""You can't think of biodiversity loss without thinking about the implications of climate change and pollution.""

They're ""all undermining our economy,"" worsening health and poverty and threatening food and water security and even national security, Watson said.

Experts have warned that the world is nearing a tipping point on climate change, species and land loss and other harms. But efforts to address those problems largely have been pursued through individual agreements that haven't made nearly enough progress, they said.

Instead, they advocate an approach that involves every area of government, the financial sector, industry and citizens and a circular economy that recognizes that natural resources are limited.

""What we're saying is we can become much more sustainable, but it will take unprecedented change to transform these systems,"" Watson said. ""It has to be done rapidly now because we're running out of time.""

Global tipping point

The report lays out a dire future if the world continues on its current path.

Emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases — primarily from burning fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil — reached a new high in 2024, despite decades of negotiations between countries to curb emissions.

Ten years ago, almost 200 nations signed the Paris Agreement with the goal of limiting future warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times to avoid or lessen the most catastrophic effects of climate change. But on the current trajectory, the climate could warm by 2.4 degrees Celsius (4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, Watson said.

Scientists say climate change is contributing to wilder weather extremes, including more intense storms, drought, heat and wildfires.

What's more, climate change is a threat multiplier, meaning that it makes things like land degradation, deforestation and biodiversity loss worse, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, who wasn't involved in the report.

""If we don't fix climate change, we're not going to be able to fix these other issues too,"" Hayhoe said.

Among other challenges: Up to 40% of land area globally is degraded, and pollution contributes to an estimated 9 million deaths a year.

Adopting a comprehensive approach would be expensive, scientists acknowledge, but cost far less than the harms that otherwise could result.

The report says that to achieve a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and restore biodiversity, about $8 trillion in global investment is needed every year. But starting in 2050, economic benefits will surpass spending, growing to $20 trillion a year by 2070 and $100 trillion a year thereafter.

Nations also must look beyond gross domestic product as a barometer for economic health, because it doesn't measure whether growth is sustainable or recognize its potential harms, Watson said.

Environmental issues aren't the only things interlinked, Watson said. He also said governments, nonprofits, industry and the financial sector also must ensure that there are incentives and funding for renewable energy and sustainable agricultural practices, for example.

University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann, who wasn't involved in the report, welcomed its emphasis on tackling issues across governments and society.

""We must do what is right, rather than what seems politically expedient,"" Mann said. ""The stakes are simply too great.""

International cooperation falters

Despite the report's urgent call for action, international cooperation is anything but guaranteed, scientists say — especially as U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to participate in many of the discussions.

Trump, who withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, has called climate change a hoax. He's promoted fossil fuel use, canceled permits for renewable energy and is abandoning automobile fuel-efficiency standards.

""International action and agreements are becoming harder and harder,"" Watson said, noting that this year's U.N. climate conference in Brazil failed to ""move in the direction we needed it to move"" with stronger commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

Talks this summer on a treaty to address plastic pollution in Geneva ended without an agreement, though a U.N. conference earlier in the year garnered commitments for funding to protect global biodiversity.

Watson said that the U.S. didn't attend the intergovernmental meeting in Nairobi, but joined discussions on the last day and ""said they didn't agree with anything in the report.""

""Some countries might say if the U.S. is not willing to act, why should we act?"" Watson said.

Still, he believes that some countries will move forward, while others, including the U.S., could fall behind.

Hayhoe, the Texas Tech scientist, said that she's confident changes will happen, because the stakes are becoming too great.

""It is not about saving the planet. The planet will be orbiting the sun long after we're gone,"" Hayhoe said. ""The question is, will there be a healthy, thriving human society on that planet? And the answer to that question is very much up for grabs at this point.""

BRUSSELS — The U.S. has demanded that the European Union exempt its oil and gas from obligations under the bloc’s methane emissions law on fuel imports until 2035, a U.S. government document seen by Reuters showed.

Starting this year, the EU requires importers of oil and gas to Europe to monitor and report methane emissions associated with those imports, in a bid to curb emissions of the potent planet-warming gas.

The world-first climate policy has faced opposition from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has called it impossible to implement and warned it could disrupt U.S. gas supplies to Europe. European countries have increased imports of U.S. liquefied natural gas as they phase out oil and gas from Russia.

The U.S. document said that in the absence of a “full repeal” of the EU law, Washington was asking the EU to “delay requiring U.S. emissions data reporting under the EUMR [EU Methane Regulation] until October 2035″.

“The EU Methane Regulations is a critical non-tariff trade barrier that imposes an undue burden on U.S. exporters and our trade relationship,” said the document, circulated to EU member governments ahead of a meeting of their energy ministers in Brussels on Monday.

The EU said last week it would offer companies simpler routes to prove compliance with the law. But EU officials have refused to weaken the policy’s core requirements on fuel imports, which will become tougher over time.

“We will help … in making sure that we can implement this. But we will not change the legislation. We are very proud of this legislation,” EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen told reporters on Monday.

Methane emissions are the second-biggest cause of global warming, after carbon dioxide.

The U.S. document also asked the EU to deem U.S. methane emissions laws equivalent to its own – meaning U.S. producers would automatically comply – and for Brussels to commit to not apply penalties if U.S. oil and gas imports breach the rules.

Industry sources said it was unlikely the U.S. could be granted this “equivalence”, since the Trump administration has moved to roll back its federal emissions reporting requirements, including by suspending some for the oil and gas sector until 2034.

A joint paper by U.S. and EU oil and gas industry groups, seen by Reuters, also called for changes to the policy – including delaying tougher obligations due to apply from 2027 – but stopped short of demanding an exemption for U.S. oil and gas.

A spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the EU did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://journalrecord.com/files/2025/12/MethanePage-7-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 22:00:59.297066

On December 8, Morgan Stanley began coverage of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) with an Equal Weight rating and $14 price target. The move is part of the firm’s 2026 outlook for the autos and shared mobility sector following the change in analysts. The firm said it is “leaning more cautious” heading into next year, expecting the electric vehicle “winter” to continue through 2026. This cautious view is partially balanced by a “moderately more positive” outlook on internal combustion engines and hybrids, the analysts noted in a research update.

On December 9, Renault announced a partnership with Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to develop small, more affordable electric vehicles for the European market and to jointly produce commercial vans. The collaboration is aimed at reducing costs and addressing rising competition from Chinese automakers.

As part of the partnership, the first of the two planned small EVs will be built at a Renault plant in northern France and is expected to reach European showrooms in 2028. According to Farley, CEO of Ford, these vehicles will be smaller than anything Ford plans for the US market and will fill a gap in the automaker’s lineup.

The two companies will also work together to develop Renault and Ford brand vans for Europe. The partnership came together after a renewed team visited Ford’s Detroit headquarters in March.

On Monday, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley announced a “customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable” company. How does it plan to do that? As part of its latest pivot, it will move to “higher-return opportunities”, taking a $19.5 billion hit in the process as it reprioritizes production away from large electric vehicles.

Broadly speaking, Ford is stepping away from models like the battery-powered F-150 Lightning. Instead, the next-generation model will become a range-extended electric vehicle (REEV), like the Ram 1500 REV. The automaker also seems to be following more or less in Stellantis’ path on this one, as the fully electric Ram pickup is also officially dead.

Ford also plans to cancel its electric successor to the E-Transit commercial van. Instead, a new and more affordable van, backed by internal combustion and hybrid models, will launch from the Ohio plant that builds the E-Series in 2029.

Overall, Ford is shifting its focus to the new Universal EV platform, from which it already announced a midsize truck will emerge from the Louisville, Kentucky assembly plant in 2027. That new focus will also expand to include passenger car models, as well, as Ford plans to bring “five new affordable vehicles” to market by the end of the decade. Of those models, Ford says four of them will be assembled in the United States, as well. Nearly every vehicle in the range, will feature “multi-energy” powertrain options by 2030.

This plan, Ford claims, will help up its global sales share for electrified vehicles (hybrids, extended-range hybrids and full EVs) to 50%, up from 17% today. The move may also bring the company’s “Model e” electric division to profitability by 2029.

The automaker also announced plans to bring battery energy storage into the mix. That repurposes former electric vehicle battery capacity from vehicles toward static energy storage.

Military conflicts, regulatory ambiguity and general government instability are all unsavory risks that they must assume when working in a global setting.

Danos is no newcomer to international work, but having to respond recently to a potential air attack on one of its jobsites was most definitely not in its wheelhouse.

The ink had barely dried on the acquisition of Performance Energy Services last year when it had to evacuate a 200-person Performance crew from a Chevron offshore platform off the coast of Israel.

“During the conflict between Israel and Iran, there was concern that Iran would attack critical infrastructure, so we got our people off the platform immediately via a marine transport, which took them to another country, and we were able to fly them home,” says Paul Danos, CEO of the Gray-headquartered company.

The entire evacuation took only 36 hours. “We had an advantage being on a platform,” Danos adds. “The airspace over Israel was locked down, and we wouldn’t have been able to leave. As it was, we were able to get them on a ship, move them to a different location and fly them out.”

In its role, the Danos team—through its acquisition of Performance—provides construction services for Chevron, a major player in the development of natural gas fields in the Mediterranean.

“It has turned Israel from being dependent on foreign sources of hydrocarbons to now being an actual exporter,” Danos says. “They’re able to meet their own country’s natural gas needs as well as deliver natural gas to countries in the region, which from a geopolitical security standpoint is huge for them. In effect, Israel is leaning on south Louisiana knowhow to develop their oil and gas fields.”

Danos is also turning its attention to Guyana’s burgeoning offshore market. ExxonMobil discovered one of the largest offshore finds in the world near the country, and is currently operating several FPSOs—floating production storage and offloading—facilities there.

Danos’ business development team is currently making the necessary connections, as well as identifying a Guyana-based business partner.

“Many countries have requirements that you must have a local partner and that you employ a certain number of local people, so we’re working through that in Guyana,” he adds. “We’re excited about the opportunities there.”

More commonly, Danos finds itself working in domestic waters for an internationally owned company.

In June, the company was awarded a three-year contract renewal with Italian energy company Eni to provide production labor in the Gulf. The agreement includes approximately 50 offshore positions, such as production operators, instrumentation and electrical technicians, mechanics and electricians.

The contract builds on Danos’ longstanding relationship with Eni. In addition to production services, Danos also provides Eni with fabrication, construction and scaffolding services support through Performance Energy Services, the company’s project services offering.

Paul Danos says other challenges encountered when working overseas are, thankfully, not military in nature. “You have logistical challenges and language barriers, of course, but the biggest challenge over the years—generally speaking—has been a lack of certainty with the political and regulatory environment,” he notes.

“While we’ve had our regulatory challenges here in the U.S., relative to the rest of the world we have a very stable market. We know what to expect, we know what the rules are, and we follow the rules.

“Administrations come and go, and the rules shift a bit, but we know what the rules are, the rules are enforced fairly, and we can plan on that.”

That’s not necessarily the case in international markets, where companies must contend with significant uncertainty from a regulatory, tax or legal standpoint. A lot of business takes place “under the table” and breaking the rules is sometimes necessary for a company to win a bid or turn a profit.

“Frankly, that’s why we’ve pulled back from some markets,” Danos says. “We weren’t going to go and just blatantly break the rules.”

Other Louisiana companies are leveraging the expertise of overseas partners to grow their domestic portfolios. In July, Bollinger formed a strategic international partnership with Rauma Shipyards and Aker Arctic, both of Finland, and Seaspan Shipyards of Canada, for a very domestic purpose: to produce the lowest-risk, fastest delivery solution of best-in-class Arctic Security Cutters to the U.S. Coast Guard.

Together, the companies represent some of the world’s premier icebreaker shipbuilding companies. Bollinger, the largest privately-owned shipbuilder in the U.S., has delivered nearly 200 high-performance vessels to the U.S. Coast Guard in the last 40 years, while Rauma is Finland’s largest “ice-class” shipyard.

“We haven’t been awarded that yet, but I certainly feel like we’re well positioned to win that program,” says Ben Bordelon, president and CEO of Bollinger. “The administration wants vessels fast and they want them now, so we put a team in place that I feel has the best design, as well as the best shipyard (Rauma) for icebreakers and complex vessels. They have the capacity now, and our combined effort will get vessels delivered quickly while ensuring that much of this program is built here in the U.S.”

Being privately owned helped Bollinger put the deal together quickly. The strategic partnership leverages the trilateral ICE Pact framework between the U.S., Canada and Finland to rapidly grow a modernized U.S. icebreaking fleet, with delivery of the first vessel within 36 months of award.

So far, Bollinger has gone through the vetting process, created a proposal and submitted the plan to the White House.

“I spent some time in Finland, along with some of my management team, and got a chance to get my boots on the ground and meet the CEO of the Rauma facility,” Bordelon says.

Diversification has been critical to Bollinger’s business model, ever since the precipitous decline in the offshore oil and gas market a decade ago. “I consider Bollinger a three-legged stool of a business where we have commercial work, government work and then repair,” Bordelon says.

“I feel like we have a great structure and a great footprint of facilities. We have 80 years that we’re going to be celebrating next year, but we’re also very forward leaning and progressive. We need to keep growing, pushing and developing our facilities, not only from a footprint, structure and technology standpoint, but our workforce as well.”

Domestic Work with Foreign Ties

Some companies stick to domestic work but nonetheless find themselves interacting with international clients. In its capacity as one of the largest industrial contractors in the region, Performance Contractors of Baton Rouge frequently works with overseas-headquartered owners and engineers.

At times, they’ll send managers overseas to assist engineering firms with preliminary designs and “constructability” issues on large mega projects. When that happens, key members of the Performance team might work for up to a year in a European or Asian office.

“It’s usually for the client’s convenience,” says Lee Jenkins, senior vice president of Performance. “They prefer to have us come to them, and we’re happy to do it. When we do that, we’re saddled with them 8 to 12 hours a day for months at a time. It’s a totally dedicated effort, so being together in the same office and in the same time zone has the potential to impact the project in a positive way.”

It also helps build relationships, which can reap benefits during construction.

But even when working on U.S.-based jobsites, local contractors must often contend with incompatible international policies.

“You have to deal with what I would consider to be an international business model … a cultural model that is typically seen overseas that we don’t see quite as often in the U.S., in terms of how projects are executed,” Jenkins adds.

Foreign owners typically prefer a unit price contract—where payment is based on the quantity of work performed at a predetermined price for each unit of work or material—“and that has not proven to be a successful strategy here. That’s not something that U.S. contractors are going to be too interested in.”

Recent hikes in international tariffs have added another wrinkle, particularly in the procurement of materials. Some owners prefer that certain equipment or materials be purchased internationally, but that might not be cost feasible in today’s market.

Jenkins points to differing management styles and contract compliance expectations as additional sticking points.

“From a quality assurance and control perspective, the reporting expectations could vary,” he adds. “Not to say that they’re better or worse, but language barriers, management styles, cultures in the workplace … all these things can definitely have an impact.”",https://www.1012industryreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Paul-Danos-1-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-15 20:00:56.657756

Ford on Monday also announced that it is taking a $19.5 billion writedown and canceling several electric vehicle models in the face of Trump administration policies and lackluster demand for electric vehicles.

In a press release, the company said the conversion of the Glendale plant, which began operations in August, would “serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market” by leveraging “currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford.” The company said it would invest $2 billion over two years to scale the energy storage business and deploy at least 20 gigawatt-hours annually of energy storage batteries by late 2027.

These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers,” the company wrote in its press release.

The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that Ford executive Andrew Frick said the BlueOval SK battery plant is expected to lay off all of its approximately 1,500 employees in the near future, though the final date of employment has not been announced. The newspaper reported the retooled plant would employ 2,100 workers with some currently employed workers anticipated to reapply.

Workers at the battery plant had sought to unionize with the United Auto Workers, with the results of an union election held in August still being contested before the National Labor Relations Council.

Ford said production of a previously announced electric truck and universal electric vehicle platform to be built in Louisville continues to progress with production set to start in 2027.

The battery plant located on Interstate 65 in Glendale, was previously a joint venture between Ford and South Korea-based SK On. The companies announced last week they were ending the partnership.

Originally planned to be two plants with billions of dollars of cumulative investment, the companies announced in 2023 that the second plant would be indefinitely idled due in part to softening electric vehicle demand.

Republican lawmakers in the Kentucky legislature who represent Hardin County issued statements expressing both optimism and caution about the announced conversion.

State Reps. Samara Heavrin, R-Leitchfield, and Steve Bratcher, R-Elizabethtown, in a joint statement said their focus remained “on making sure the men and women whose jobs are impacted by this decision have the support and resources they need to find new employment and that going forward this new project delivers real, lasting investment and meaningful employment for the families and communities surrounding Glendale.”

“We are optimistic about Ford Motor Company’s decision to take over the Glendale facility and transition the project toward energy storage, particularly as initial plans for the project have faced significant challenges from the outset. At the same time, optimism must be matched with both caution and accountability, and we will be watching closely to ensure commitments are met and honored,” the two Republicans said in their statement.

State Sen. Matt Deneen, R-Elizabethtown, in a statement said there would be “short-term challenges” but that Ford’s investment in Glendale “underscores the company’s long-term commitment to this community.”

Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear previously blamed Republicans in Washington for federal policies that jeopardized the EV battery plant. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles, and the Trump administration has targeted Biden administration regulations that sought to encourage the production of electric vehicles.

Beshear in a statement provided through a spokesperson said the state would remain “the EV battery capital of the U.S. because EV is — and will be — part of America’s future, despite the President’s shortsighted attacks on the industry.” He said the main focus was to find new jobs for impacted BlueOval employees.

He also said he remained confident in Ford and that he was in “direct contact” with the company’s leadership “to ensure the restructured project moves forward and is successful for both the company, Kentucky and our workforce.”

A Beshear spokesperson said the terms of the state’s incentive agreement with Ford were being renegotiated. Kentucky had offered $250 million in public monies for the BlueOval SK operation.

The company is poised to launch its first electric vehicle, the eVitara, in the Indian market next year, which is already being exported to international markets.

When Maruti Suzuki entered the Indian automotive landscape in the early 1980s, it encountered a lack of supply chains, limited service networks, and minimal consumer confidence. The company invested years in developing these essential components to establish a functioning market. Now, it believes that the transition to electric vehicles requires a similar foundational approach.

Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer for Marketing and Sales at Maruti Suzuki, emphasised the importance of building trust with consumers. “At that time there was no industry. We created it,” he stated during a media roundtable. He acknowledged that several concerns still hinder the adoption of electric vehicles, including range anxiety, insufficient charging infrastructure, and the need for reliable after-sales service. “EV penetration is low because confidence is low. The ecosystem has to come first,” he added.

In response to these challenges, Maruti Suzuki is making significant investments to establish the necessary ecosystem. The company has set up 2,000 dedicated charging points throughout its sales and service network. Additionally, its nationwide workforce is undergoing retraining to support electric drivetrains and software-based diagnostics. Maruti is also preparing a service model that prioritises breakdown support over routine maintenance, which is less frequent for electric vehicles.

The company is offering several initiatives to encourage adoption, including an assured buyback programme, a Battery as a Service (BaaS) model, and subscription options for consumers.

Banerjee highlighted that the primary barrier to EV adoption lies in consumer psychology. Many households remain hesitant to consider electric vehicles as their main mode of transport due to persistent worries about charging availability. “Unless customers believe they can charge anywhere and that we stand behind the product, adoption won’t accelerate,” he remarked. “Confidence takes time.”

Price remains another obstacle, although the Indian government has introduced incentives to promote electric vehicles, such as a lower Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate of 5% for EVs compared to 40% for large internal combustion engine vehicles. Banerjee noted that it is now up to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to educate consumers and further develop the ecosystem.

Since batteries constitute approximately 40% of the total cost of electric vehicles, Banerjee believes that vehicle prices will decrease as battery manufacturing costs decline. He also observed a shift in market dynamics, explaining that the decision to launch an SUV as its first electric model was strategic. “We needed to increase our market share in SUVs, and that category is growing because of an unusually high number of launches there,” he explained.

Maruti Suzuki has already dispatched 10,000 units of the eVitara for export, while domestic sales are still being evaluated in light of changes to GST and new fuel-efficiency regulations. The company had previously projected annual car sales in India to reach between 5.5 million and 6 million by the fiscal year 2030, with 13% to 15% of those sales expected to be electric vehicles. However, Banerjee noted that these estimates will need to be reassessed next fiscal year due to recent developments.

Looking to the future, Maruti Suzuki plans to introduce five electric vehicles by the fiscal year 2030, including the eVitara. However, the company has refrained from providing specific forecasts for EV market penetration, citing the fluid nature of the current automotive landscape.",https://cdn.optcms.com/www.indianewsnetwork.com/assets/2025/202512/20251216-img-20251216-b2c0fdf818652349-300.webp,N,,2025-12-15 20:58:54.072571

Kaufman,,,,,https://spectrum.ieee.org/amp/virtual-power-plant-litmus-2674393060,"Virtual power plants, which concatenate small, distributed energy resources, are increasingly being tapped to balance electricity supply and demand.
The question is: Can they do their job as well as conventional power plants?
To pass the Huels test, the performance of a virtual power plant must be indistinguishable from that of a conventional power plant.
“What we’re really trying to do is fool the operators into feeling that these virtual power plants can act and feel and smell like conventional power plants,” says Paul Hines, chief scientist at EnergyHub.
“This is a kind of first litmus test.” What Are Virtual Power Plants (VPPs)?","In 1950, the English mathematician Alan Turing devised what he called “the imitation game.” Later dubbed the Turing test, the experiment asks a human participant to conduct a conversation with an unknown partner and try to determine if it’s a computer or a person on the other end of the line. If the person can’t figure it out, the machine passes the Turing test.

Power grid operators are now preparing for their own version of the game. Virtual power plants, which concatenate small, distributed energy resources, are increasingly being tapped to balance electricity supply and demand. The question is: Can they do their job as well as conventional power plants?

Grid operators can now find out by running these power plants through a Turing-like test called the Huels. To pass the Huels test, the performance of a virtual power plant must be indistinguishable from that of a conventional power plant. A human grid operator serves as the judge.

Virtual power plant developer EnergyHub, based in Brooklyn, N.Y., developed the test and outlined it in a white paper released today. “What we’re really trying to do is fool the operators into feeling that these virtual power plants can act and feel and smell like conventional power plants,” says Paul Hines, chief scientist at EnergyHub. “This is a kind of first litmus test.”

What Are Virtual Power Plants (VPPs)?

The virtual-versus-conventional power plant question is a timely one. Virtual power plants, or VPPs, are networks of devices such as rooftop solar panels, home batteries, and smart thermostats that come together through software to collectively supply or conserve electricity.

Unlike conventional power generation systems, which might crank up one big gas plant when electricity demand peaks, VPPs tap into small, widely disbursed equipment. For example, a VPP might harness electricity from hundreds of plugged-in electric vehicles or rooftop solar panels. Or it might direct smart thermostats in homes or businesses to turn down heat or cooling systems to reduce demand.

The technology is emerging at a time when concerns over data centers’ electricity demand is hitting a fever pitch. The consultancy BloombergNEF estimates data-center energy demand in the United States will reach 106 gigawatts by 2035–a 36 percent jump from what it had projected just seven months ago.

How utilities and grid operators will meet the growing demand is unclear and faces challenges on many fronts. Turbines for natural gas plants are backordered and new nuclear reactors are still years away. Wind and solar, while cheap and fast to build, don’t produce the 24/7 electricity that data centers demand, and face an uphill political battle under the Trump administration.

All of this together has created an opening for VPPs, which could add gigawatts to the grid without significantly jacking up electricity rates. “It’s a political issue. If you said you’re going to get electricity costs under control, this is literally the only way to do it in 12 months,” says Jigar Shah, a clean energy investor at Multiplier in Washington, D.C., who led the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office under the Biden administration.

VPPs could also reduce utilities’ need to invest in distribution equipment, avoiding supply chain shortages and inflated costs, Shah says. “There is no other idea that you could possibly deploy in 12 months that would have that big of an impact,” he says.

According to a 2024 U.S. Department of Energy report, VPPs could provide between 80 and 160 gigawatts of capacity across the U.S. by 2030—enough to meet between 10 and 20 percent of peak grid demand.

How Can VPPs Gain Grid Operator Trust?

But first, VPP developers have to win over grid developers. Benchmarks like the Huels test are crucial to building that trust. “In order for us to build our reliance on VPPs, they do need to pass the Huels test and operators need to be able to count on” the VPPs delivering power when called upon, said Lauren Shwisberg, a principal in the nonprofit research group Rocky Mountain Institute who co-authored a recent report on VPPs and was not involved in the development of the test.

Matthias Huels, an engineer who spent more than four years at EnergyHub, first came up with the idea for the test in 2024. After workshopping the idea with colleagues and, somewhat ironically, ChatGPT, Huels presented the concept to the company.

Huels designed the test subjectively. Currently, in its earliest iteration, it appears to follow a guideline akin to the Supreme Court’s “I know it when I see it” test for what distinguishes pornography from erotic art. That is to say: passing the test depends on who’s judging. If a grid operator finds the power from a VPP as dependable as electricity from an actual power plant burning gas to produce electrons, then the VPP has passed.

There are four levels to the Huels test. To reach level 1, a VPP must be able to shave off demand from the grid by, for example, successfully scheduling smart thermostats to dial down when the grid faces maximum demand. To reach level 2, a VPP must be able to respond to market and grid data and dial down demand when prices hit a certain level or tap into solar panels or batteries when power is needed. Human decision makers are involved at these levels.

Passing the Huels test comes at level 3. That’s when a VPP can function automatically because it’s proven reliable enough to be indistinguishable from a gas peaker plant–the type of power station that comes online as backup only when the grid is under stress. Passing level 4 involves VPPs acting fully autonomously to adjust output based on a number of actively-changing variables throughout the day.

“The imitation game that Alan Turing came up with was: Can a computer fool an interrogator to think it’s actually human even though it’s a computer,” Hines says. “We propose this idea of a test that would allow us to say: Can we fool a grid operator into thinking that the thing that’s actually solving their problems is this aggregation of many devices instead of a big gas plant?”

Can VPPs Mimic Gas Peaker Plants?

Peaker plants only generate power about 5 percent of the time over their lifespans. That makes them easier for VPPs to mimic because, like peaker plants, the limited amount of power that can be made available by demand response or harvested from batteries only provides bursts of power that last a few hours at a time.

Far more difficult is stacking up to a full-scale gas plant, which operates 65 percent of the time or more, or a nuclear plant, which usually operates at least 95 percent of the time. Getting there would involve equipping a VPP network with long-duration storage that could be powered up during the day when solar panels are at peak output and discharged all night long. “You start talking about VPPs with large amounts of batteries that can run 365 days per year,” Hines says. “That’s a road we can go down.”

EnergyHub has been putting its VPP systems through the Huels test. Last year, EnergyHub successfully ran trials with Arizona Public Service, Duke Energy in North Carolina, and National Grid in Massachusetts. In Arizona, EnergyHub’s software dialed into homes with solar panels and smart thermostats and ran air conditioners to “pre-cool” houses during the day when the sun was generating lots of electricity. This allowed the state’s biggest utility to reduce demand during peak hours when residents would typically return home from work to turn on televisions and crank up their air conditioners.

“You have too much power in the middle of the day because of solar, then the early evening comes and you get people ramping up their evening loads right as the solar is ramping down,” Hines says. “You need something that can feather through that schedule. We created something that can do this.”

That lands the company somewhere between a 2 and 3 on the Huels testing scale. Passing level 3 “is going to take a few years,” Hines says.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/ilustration-of-a-hand-holding-up-a-lightbulb-inside-the-lightbulb-is-a-home-with-solar-panels-and-an-electric-car-charging.jpg?id=62504289&width=35&height=35,N,,2025-12-15 22:01:03.606326

(Nasdaq: WKHS) (“Workhorse” or the “Company”), an American manufacturer of zero-emission commercial vehicles, and Motiv Electric Trucks (“Motiv”), a leading manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses, today announced that they have completed their merger and are moving forward as Workhorse, a leading North American manufacturer of medium-duty electric trucks and buses.

With the completion of the transaction, Workhorse has scalable manufacturing capabilities, advanced and road-tested products, and a robust go-to-market approach which includes successfully developing commercial relationships with 10 of the largest commercial truck fleets in North America.

In connection with the completion of the transaction, Motiv’s legacy controlling investor has provided Workhorse with up to $50 million in new debt financing capacity, of which approximately $10 million is available in a revolving credit facility and up to an additional $40 million is available to fund supply-chain related costs associated with new purchase orders. In addition to materially reducing time from order-to-delivery, these financings are expected to provide significant liquidity to fund growth.

“At Workhorse, we’re not just building electric trucks, we’re building better trucks. Our software-first electric trucks are powerful, cost-efficient, reliable, safe, and comfortable—all with zero tailpipe emissions and pollution,” said Scott Griffith, who became CEO of Workhorse upon the close of the transaction. “Workhorse trucks perform the same or better as their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, while costing far less over the lifetime of the vehicle.”

“Looking ahead,” Griffith continued, “we are going to build on our 20-plus year combined legacy in electrification and the thousand-plus electric trucks and buses we have delivered to meet the needs of our growing customer base. In doing so, we believe we are positioned to drive profitable growth, create value for our shareholders and customers and deliver on our Better Trucks, Better World ambition.”

Workhorse is poised to create value for shareholders and customers by:

Producing the best truck, period. Advanced safety, telematics, and ergonomics combined with superior cost and maintenance advantages position Workhorse to capture market share in the medium-duty truck and bus space.

Building on significant commercial fleet traction. Workhorse has served 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets owned by some of the biggest and most respected brands in North America and enters 2026 with a strong sales pipeline and backlog of orders for trucks, step vans, school buses, and shuttles.

Leveraging existing world-class in-house manufacturing. With a nameplate capacity of 5,000+ vehicles per year in place, Workhorse has the ability to produce the annual number of vehicles it believes is required to reach profitability without the need for significant new capital expenditures at its manufacturing plant in Indiana.

Applying learnings from the Stables project. Workhorse also owns and operates a mix of gas and electric step vans in a FedEx Ground Independent Service Provider (ISP) fleet through its Stables project. This real-world test bed, operating in Ohio, brings real-time data on trucks in service and an operator mindset to the Workhorse design process, resulting in purpose-built features, direct feedback from depot managers and drivers, deeper insights into range and route planning, and extended durability testing.

Benefiting from an experienced management team. The combined management team has a proven track record of designing great products, selling to commercial fleets, and scaling manufacturing in the automotive space.

Putting growth capital to work. With a clean balance sheet, up to $50 million of added debt capacity, and access to the public capital markets, Workhorse has immediate capability to both drive new and fulfil existing orders for trucks and buses.

Experienced and Proven Executive Leadership

As of the close of the merger, Workhorse will have a refreshed, highly qualified board and management team comprising: Scott Griffith, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Ginnan, Chief Financial Officer; James Griffin, Chief Revenue Officer; Scott Zion, Chief Product Officer; and Josh Anderson, Executive Vice President of Operations. The combined company’s Board is comprised of seven directors, five designated by Motiv, including Scott Griffith and Matthew O’Leary, who will be Chairman. Additional information on the Board is available at ir.workhorse.com.

Going forward, Workhorse will initially be headquartered in the Wixom, Michigan area, with plans to expand to a larger presence in the Detroit metro area. The Company will also retain a presence in Cincinnati, Ohio and the Bay Area of California. It will continue to produce vehicles out of the Workhorse Ranch, its commercial-scale manufacturing facility, in Union City, Indiana. The 436,000 sq. ft., 92.6 acre facility has an annual capacity of 5,200 vehicles and includes production, logistics and a customer training center. The site also includes another 200,000 sq. ft. of vehicle storage space and a Noise, Vibration, Handling test track (NVH).

What’s Next For the Texas Class VI Program Louisiana’s experience transitioning to Class VI primacy may shed light on the upcoming trends in Texas.","As energy infrastructure projects ramp up along the U.S. Gulf Coast and beyond, the role of states in holding primary enforcement authority (“primacy”) for certain federal programs has taken center stage; this is particularly true for owners and developers seeking approval for Carbon Capture and Sequestration (“CCS”) projects. Since 2018, six states have received primacy for the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Class VI underground injection control program, which applies to wells used to inject and permanently sequester carbon dioxide underground. Although Texas’s Class VI primacy was just approved in November 2025, recent developments in Louisiana’s Class VI permitting efforts provide insight into the shifting disputes surrounding energy-infrastructure permits and projects.

States Are Requesting, and Receiving, Class VI Primacy

Since EPA first granted Class VI primacy to North Dakota in 2018, state interest in Class VI primacy has grown. Wyoming became the second state to receive primacy in 2020, followed by Louisiana in January 2024. Given Louisiana’s key role in Gulf Coast energy and development, the grant of Class VI primacy to Louisiana positioned the state as a national leader in CCS, leveraging the region’s favorable geology and existing energy infrastructure to accelerate projects, while setting a precedent for other states.

Developments in Louisiana since the state’s receipt of primacy provide a useful guide for CCS project developers anticipating potential challenges in Texas and other states that recently granted Class VI primacy.

Challenges to State Primacy

EPA’s delegation of Class VI primacy to Louisiana prompted swift legal challenges brought by three environmental groups in Deep South Center for Environmental Justice et al. v. EPA. The opening brief, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, alleged that Class VI primacy would divert resources from preferred programming, increase energy costs, impose higher tax burdens, and endanger public health and the environment.

In May 2025, the Fifth Circuit rejected the challenge to Louisiana’s Class VI primacy, holding that the injuries alleged by plaintiffs were either not recognized by federal courts or were too speculative and hypothetical and dependent upon the occurrence of a lengthy chain of events before injury might arise. With no injuries to redress, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the challenge for lack of standing.

In West Virginia, environmental groups also challenged the state’s Class VI primacy in West Virginia Surface Owners’ Rights Organization et al. v. Zeldin before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The groups argued that the state’s alleged failure to enforce regulations pertaining to abandoned oil and gas wells demonstrated an inability to appropriately enforce Class VI well regulations. That challenge remains pending; the Fourth Circuit’s current briefing schedule extends through March 2026.

Louisiana Issues Its First Class VI Permit

After successfully defending its Class VI primacy, Louisiana assumed authority over the Class VI regulatory program in early 2024 and began processing the Louisiana Class VI applications that had been pending at EPA Region 6. After a nearly-four year application process, beginning at EPA and moving to Louisiana’s Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly, the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources) (the “Department”), Hackberry Carbon Sequestration received the first Louisiana-issued Class VI permit on September 5, 2025. The permit is now final.

Moratorium on New Louisiana Class VI Applications

Amid a surge in Louisiana Class VI permit applications, in October 2025, Governor Jeff Landry issued an executive order (No. JML 25-119) (the “Order”) “suspend[ing] review of any new Class VI applications . . . submitted” to the Department after October 15, 2025. The stated purpose of the Order is “to provide a clear roadmap for citizens and local officials, ensuring that applications for proposed Class VI projects comply with existing Louisiana rules for carbon injection . . . and carbon dioxide pipelines.” The Order explains that the pause grants time for Louisiana to cultivate a Class VI application-review process that balances the state’s economic interests with health, welfare, and the environment by prioritizing Class VI projects with the most substantial local economic benefits. The moratorium also states that this will ensure transparency and community input, creating a collaborative agency process as well as environmental and safety protections.

Although the Order imposes additional procedures, it does not prohibit the Department from processing pending applications or issuing Class VI permits for applications submitted pre-moratorium. The moratorium has no termination date; it is unclear when the Department may resume accepting new Class VI well applications.

Despite the moratorium, the Order includes numerous statements supportive of CCS, highlighting Louisiana’s decades-long CCS history, the industry’s multi-billion-dollar economic impact, and the thousands of jobs the industry is expected to create, indicating that CCS will likely remain active in Louisiana.

Related Energy-Infrastructure Litigation

Beyond direct challenges to state permitting authority or individual permits, CCS projects can also face indirect attacks related to supporting infrastructure, non-Class VI authorizations required for project construction or operation, and questions surrounding property rights and ownership, including of pore space.

Coastal Use Permits. Louisiana maintains a specific permitting scheme applicable to energy infrastructure projects within Louisiana’s coastal zone in an effort to preserve, restore, and enhance Louisiana’s valuable coastal resources. This authorizations, called a Coastal Use Permit (“CUP”), must be secured before project construction. Recently, in Sierra Club et al. v. Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, three Louisiana NGOs challenged a CUP issued to Commonwealth LNG to support construction of a new liquified natural gas plant and export facility on the Calcasieu River in Cameron Parish. The plaintiffs argued that regulators failed to adequately evaluate the facility’s local environmental impacts before granting the CUP. A Louisiana state court agreed, vacating the CUP and remanding the decision to the Department to further consider environmental impacts, including cumulative impacts, on nearby low-income and minority communities, as well as the facility’s broader environmental and climate effects. On November 18, 2025, the Department issued a revised environmental analysis, concluding that the facility’s social and economic benefits outweigh the minimal environmental costs, and reissued the CUP. Further legal challenges have not yet been filed.

Use of Eminent Domain for CCS. The use of eminent domain authority for CCS projects has sparked significant litigation across the country, including in the context of carbon dioxide pipelines. Louisiana is no exception to this trend. Recently, in Save My Louisiana v. State, a coalition of Louisiana residents and local officials sued the state of Louisiana, arguing that statutes giving the Department authority to seize private property for use by for-profit corporations for CCS purposes violate the Louisiana and United States constitutions. Although the plaintiffs also address land seizures for CO2 pipelines, plaintiffs’ primary contention is that Louisiana law guarantees a landowner ownership rights to the pore space beneath the land, and any statute forcing a non-consenting landowner to accept injected carbon into that pore space constitutes an illegal taking of private property, regardless of whether the landowner receives just compensation. The court has not set a briefing schedule yet.

What’s Next For the Texas Class VI Program

Louisiana’s experience transitioning to Class VI primacy may shed light on the upcoming trends in Texas. With CCS development on the rise in Texas, increased regulatory and citizen engagement with Class VI wells makes Texas a potential next focal point for CCS litigation. Texas’s Class VI primacy became effective December 15, 2025. The Railroad Commission of Texas (“RRC”) is expected to receive 18 pending Class VI applications that are currently under review at EPA.

Like Louisiana, Texas may face programmatic challenges to its Class VI primacy as well as direct and indirect legal and policy-related1 challenges to CCS projects. Texas has seen a general rise in challenges to energy infrastructure projects, as oil and gas, wind, solar, and LNG buildouts occur across the state; CCS projects are likely to be no exception.2

Adopting a Proactive Approach to Permitting and Potential Project Challenges

Given the current and changing legal landscape, CCS project developers should consider efforts to anticipate and address potential permitting hurdles, including proactive external affairs efforts and community engagement strategies. While community outreach does not guarantee regulatory approval, early engagement can help mitigate many of the challenges inherent in the permitting process. An informed public that understands the local benefits of CCS projects can meaningfully contribute to a smoother path toward project realization.",https://bbt-prod-cd.azurewebsites.net/assets/src/images/logo-og.gif,N,,2025-12-15 20:59:33.719321

White people living in the area had lower exposure simply because they lived further away from the sources of formaldehyde emissions.","Formaldehyde is one of those chemicals that is absolutely everywhere. Naturally occurring in timber products, it’s also used for its preservative properties in other building materials, house goods, beauty products (including chemical hair relaxers), automotive parts, fertilizers, embalming…really, the list goes on and on.

But the bottom line is that formaldehyde is a carcinogen that most people encounter in their daily lives. And yet for even such a widespread chemical pollutant, Black people are often exposed to formaldehyde at higher rates than white people are — and it’s now the latest target for a regulatory rollback from the Trump Administration.

The EPA’s Convenient New Theory

Such a move has been expected since the beginning of the second Trump Administration, and earlier this month, the Environmental Protection Agency published a draft memo that operates under the assumption that there’s a safe level of formaldehyde exposure — something that has never been established scientifically.

The draft regulation would roughly double the allowable exposure level established by the Biden Administration. Formaldehyde causes more cancers than any other air pollutant — 77 cases for every 1 million people — and can create other respiratory issues, too.

The widespread use of formaldehyde does make it more of a challenge to control exposure levels. But by the same measure, formaldehyde is everywhere. And because there are both indoor and outdoor sources of formaldehyde, there are two major avenues for exposure to occur.

And while indoor levels are relatively consistent among socioeconomic groups, things look different for outside exposure, which can be significantly higher in some urban areas that have freeways and/or factories.

A study of Beaumont, Texas, a city near Houston that is about half Black, found that Black residents breathed air with 7% higher concentrations than white residents, with 44% of the formaldehyde coming from the local refinery and other industrial sources. White people living in the area had lower exposure simply because they lived further away from the sources of formaldehyde emissions.

A Test Case

While the change to formaldehyde regulations is cause for concern in and of itself, many see the approach Trump’s EPA is taking as the first step in a larger shift in how chemicals are regulated.

The chemical industry pushes for safe levels of exposure in regulations, even if they don’t exist, so that there’s a range of pollution that they don’t have to address, David Michaels, an epidemiology professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University, explained to The New York Times.

“It’s a signal of the approach that E.P.A. will take and has consequences for other carcinogens,” he said. “It’s antithetical to the rhetoric of ‘Make America Healthy Again.’ This will do the opposite.”

It’s no exaggeration to say that this change is just what the chemical industry wants: the top two people in the EPA department that regulates chemical safety joined the agency after working as higher-ups at the American Chemistry Council, the industry’s leading trade association.",https://wordinblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-146436170.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 18:01:00.170613

The reforms have included proposed changes to environmental review timelines, requirements, and processes, all of which has an impact on the outdoor community.

Although lawmakers may have different motivations for pursing permitting reform—whether to address climate change or to speed development on public lands—many decision makers are concerned about the federal permitting process and how it is not keeping pace with the challenges of climate change, energy security, aging infrastructure, or growing demand for outdoor recreation.

While the outdoor community understands the need for permitting reform, it shouldn’t—and doesn’t need to—come at the expense of outdoor recreation experiences.

Later this week, the House is expected to vote on the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act (H.R. 4776), a bipartisan bill that would fundamentally alter the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)—the bedrock law that ensures federal decisions are informed by science, transparent to the public, and accountable when they go wrong. While we appreciate the intent of the SPEED Act, we are concerned that, as written, the bill goes too far in limiting key aspects of NEPA that help outdoor recreationists to participate in decisions about public lands and waters, while offering little assurance that projects would actually move faster or with less controversy.

NEPA Is Important But It’s Not Perfect

While the SPEED Act is billed as “tech-neutral,” its impacts would be sweeping. It would apply to fossil fuel development and renewable energy projects alike, and it would affect virtually every type of federal action on public lands and waters. Several provisions are especially concerning for outdoor recreation:

It undermines judicial review.

NEPA only works if agencies are accountable. The SPEED Act would restrict the ability of courts to pause or stop projects and would dramatically shorten the timeline for bringing legal challenges. It would also make it harder for community members to even qualify to bring a claim in the first place.

It limits current science.

The bill would allow agencies to ignore new scientific or technical information that becomes available after a project application is submitted even if that information reveals serious impacts to trails, climbing areas, rivers, or wildlife habitat. For a recreation community that relies on up-to-date, place-based data, that’s a serious problem.

It narrows what agencies are allowed to consider.

The bill would force agencies to ignore certain foreseeable environmental impacts, potentially including climate impacts, simply because they occur later. It also creates broad new exemptions that could allow agencies to skip NEPA analysis altogether for projects that affect unique, place-based recreation resources.

The outdoor community is open to permitting reform and supports thoughtful changes that help agencies do their jobs more efficiently without sacrificing public trust, science, or accountability. In fact, those values are essential if we want projects like new trail systems and clean energy projects to succeed.

On Monday, Ford announced it would convert the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, which was built to produce EV batteries, into a facility that supports the power grid and “large demand for battery energy storage from data centers.""

“Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never make money, we are pivoting,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told the Wall Street Journal.

According to Bloomberg, all 1,600 employees at the Glendale facility will be laid off.

State Sen. Matt Deneen (R-Elizabethtown) said Ford has reaffirmed its commitment to add roughly 2,100 jobs at the plant, “replacing positions affected during this temporary transition.”

WHAS11 has reached out to Ford representatives for a comment on the reported layoffs. We have not head back at this time.

The Glendale facility will now manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford said it plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems.

“These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers,” Ford added.

In a joint statement, Reps. Samara Heavrin and Steve Bratcher, who also represent Hardin County, said they are monitoring the transition with cautious optimism.

The Republican state lawmakers said their focus is on the people whose jobs are impacted by Ford's transition.

“We are optimistic about Ford Motor Company’s decision to take over the Glendale facility and transition the project toward energy storage, particularly as initial plans for the project have faced significant challenges from the outset,” the statement said. “At the same time, optimism must be matched with both caution and accountability, and we will be watching closely to ensure commitments are met and honored.”

The announcement comes days after Ford announced a partnership with South Korean company SK On had fallen through due to a declining appetite for EVs.

Last week, Gov. Andy Beshear partially blamed President Donald Trump's ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" for the decline in EV demand. The bill, passed earlier this year, included cuts to tax cuts that supported EV purchases and infrastructure.

Beshear then singled out Republican U.S. Congressman Brett Guthrie, who represents Kentucky's second congressional district, for supporting the legislation.

“It’s really disappointing that Brett Guthrie, who has three EV plants in his district, would be the one that champions it, pushes it through, and doesn’t make any changes at all to protect those plants,” Beshear said. “If we have people that lost their jobs or jobs that are not created, your own congressman did it to ya. And that’s really, really wrong.”

WHAS11 reached out to Guthrie’s office for a response, but a spokesperson said they would not comment at this time.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/WHAS/images/a966ebe6-c1a0-498d-a92e-0f8deb1d1fae/20250819T155015/a966ebe6-c1a0-498d-a92e-0f8deb1d1fae_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 18:02:06.756662

Soaring electricity demand from data centers, combined with insufficient supply, is already pushing the PJM grid to its limit.","An upcoming decision by the largest U.S. grid operator could reshape the data center development landscape and have a major impact on millions of Americans' utility bills.

Surging data center development is creating havoc across the territory of PJM Interconnection, a power transmission system spanning 13 states in the mid-Atlantic and Midwest and encompassing many of the largest and fastest-growing data center hubs, like Northern Virginia, Chicago and Pennsylvania.

Across its service area, data centers are connecting to the grid faster than new power generation needed to supply them. The result has been skyrocketing electricity prices poised to increase households' utility bills by close to $70 by 2028, as well as a growing risk of regional blackouts as grid reliability deteriorates.

As PJM careens toward an affordability and reliability crisis, it has been forced to fundamentally rethink how data centers and their power sources connect to the grid. PJM is in the final stages of a process to establish new rules and policy tools governing data centers that aim to keep prices down and ensure reliability while still facilitating the data center sector’s rapid growth.

Whether these efforts are successful will have consequences that extend beyond the data center industry.

“As soon as 2027, we might not have enough power to go around, and what are we going to do in that situation?” said Claire Lang-Ree, an advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “How can we make sure the general public isn't paying for the electricity costs and reliability risks that are caused by a few big companies?”

PJM is expected to decide on its new data center plan by the end of this month. But what this plan will look like remains far from certain.

There are deep disagreements among the data center firms, utilities, tech giants, energy producers, governors, consumer advocates and others engaged with PJM on developing a framework to address its data center problem.

In November, a committee of stakeholders voted on 12 different proposals for how to reform the data center interconnection process, and not a single proposal passed. While the vote was nonbinding, it highlighted the divisions on the best path forward.

Amid competing priorities, the only area of consensus is that the current system isn’t working.

“The voting reflects the nearly impossible challenge of trying to ensure resource adequacy and control ratepayer costs, while also allowing data center development in a market that is already short on generation supply and faces a 5-to-7 year timeline to bring on new large-scale generating resources,” Jon Gordon, a director at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United, wrote about the meeting.

PJM is the largest of the nation's regional transmission organizations, spanning 13 states in the mid-Atlantic and Midwest.

Like all regional transmission organizations in the U.S., PJM oversees a service territory within which many utilities provide electricity to customers. More than a thousand member utilities participate in PJM, including Dominion Energy, American Electric Power and Consolidated Edison.

PJM operates the market in which those utilities buy power, and it is responsible for coordinating the flow of wholesale electricity and ensuring the reliability of the grid. While it doesn't own power plants, PJM and other operators control the approval process for adding plants and other new generation.

At the heart of PJM’s looming crisis is an imbalance between the limited supply of new power being added to the grid amid a flood of demand for electricity from data centers.

PJM is home to a higher concentration of data centers than any other U.S. grid system. Total electricity use within PJM is expected to grow by 166 gigawatts by 2030, with 55% of that growth coming from data centers, according to Grid Strategies.

Urgent action is needed to build more generation and increase the supply of power, but PJM’s generation interconnection process is fundamentally broken, according to industry observers. The grid operator has a backlog of power generation projects in its interconnection queue, with some waiting as long as seven years as an overwhelmed PJM struggles to conduct reliability studies.

Soaring electricity demand from data centers, combined with insufficient supply, is already pushing the PJM grid to its limit. The system narrowly avoided cascading blackouts on at least one occasion in 2024. According to the NRDC, by next summer, PJM will have just enough power to keep the grid reliable.

This energy supply shortage is also driving up electricity costs for consumers.

Next week, PJM is set to release the result of its capacity auction for 2027, which sets the price power plant owners will receive for the electricity they generate during periods of peak demand. These capacity prices have exploded as anticipated demand from data centers has far exceeded the amount of new generation expected to come online.

Now, capacity power prices are expected to jump more than 1,000% from 2024, an increase that would have been higher had PJM not placed a price cap on the sale. PJM’s customers collectively saw $9.4B in higher electricity bills last summer due to data centers’ impact on capacity pricing, with an additional $1.4B expected in 2026, according to the NRDC.

Under the current system, PJM customers would pay an additional $100B through 2033.

“We have this massive, almost overnight influx of load through data center development, so there's all this demand, but we're short on supply,” said Patrick Cicero, an attorney with the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, an organization that represents the interests of low-income utility customers.

“How do we figure out how to create a process whereby all these large loads that want to connect can do so in a structured manner that doesn't cause affordability or blackout concerns?”

In designing its new data center interconnection framework, PJM has several available policy tools to help bring power supply more in line with data center demand.

On the supply side, steps can be taken to expedite grid connections for generation assets being built to power data centers. On the demand side, data centers can be encouraged or required to become “flexible loads” that reduce their energy consumption or disconnect from the grid when the system is under strain.

While there is consensus among PJM stakeholders that these measures need to be in place, there are stark divisions as to whether the grid operator should be approaching data center developers with a carrot or a stick to implement them.

Groups like the NRDC and PJM’s independent market monitor, Monitoring Analytics, have proposed that data centers be required to provide their own generation to participate in the capacity market.

Data centers would only be given interruptible service until they fund the development of equivalent generation assets or agree to participate in demand response or curtailment programs. Monitoring Analytics’ proposal goes even further, arguing PJM should only allow data centers to connect to the grid when there is capacity on the system to serve them reliably.

According to the NRDC’s Lang-Ree, PJM would save its customers $100B in capacity costs by mandating that data centers develop their own capacity generation.

“If you're a data center, you just have to understand that when there's a grid emergency and there's not enough power to go around, you might get interrupted first for whatever portion of your capacity you haven't offset yet,” Lang-Ree said. “The cost implications are really jaw-dropping.”

But the data center industry and other PJM stakeholders have pushed back on such mandates.

When PJM published a “conceptual proposal” in August that would have allowed the grid operator to curtail power deliveries to data centers before other users when the grid is under strain, the Data Center Coalition filed a brief in opposition. It argued the measure “relies on unsupported assumptions, and lacks the detail necessary for customers to even evaluate technical and operational feasibility.”

The DCC, along with a coalition of governors and utilities like Exelon and PPL, have instead advocated for a more carrot-based approach. Their proposals aim to incentivize data centers to facilitate new generation by creating an expedited interconnection process for generation tied to data center projects or that state leaders identify as being critical for serving them.

A pathway proposed by PJM would approve new generations in just 10 months, rather than years. These proposals would also incentivize data centers to participate in demand response programs but wouldn't mandate them.

Advocates for affordable power and grid reliability are skeptical that these incentive-based measures will be effective. Lang-Ree called such measures a “hopes-and-dreams” approach to PJM’s problems, arguing there need to be clear rules and guidelines for what happens when there isn’t enough power to go around.

“You need enforceable requirements — trying to incentivize people to do this isn't going to work,” PULP’s Cicero said. “The only proposals that I take seriously are the ones that require bringing their own generation.”",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2024%2F01%2F6598029481bda-american-public-power-association-boehamcbaae-unsplash-1-.jpeg&width=1200&sign=v_q04-W9zvzqrt26O7E5BkzIGQMjQCuuxT_V_K6qEJw,N,,2025-12-15 19:01:03.749788

For its future EV lineup, the company is shifting focus to more affordable EV models, conceived by a so-called skunkworks team in California.","Dec 15 (Reuters) – Ford Motor said on Monday it will take a $19.5 billion writedown and is killing several electric-vehicle models, in the most dramatic example yet of the auto industry’s retreat from battery-powered models in response to the Trump administration’s policies and weakening EV demand.

The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an EREV, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery. The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.

Instead, Ford said it will pivot hard into gas and hybrid models, and eventually hire thousands of workers, even though there will be some layoffs at a jointly owned Tennessee battery plant in the near term. The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.

Ford will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in the fourth quarter and continuing through next year and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5 billion is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6 billion is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5 billion on what Ford called “program-related expenses.”

The automaker also raised its 2025 guidance for adjusted earnings before taxes and interest, to about $7 billion, up from a previous range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion.

Ford’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook for electrics dimmed significantly this year as U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.

U.S. sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.

The F-150 Lightning rolled off assembly lines starting in 2022 with much fanfare – comedian Jimmy Fallon wrote a song about the truck. Ford increased production of the model to meet an influx of 200,000 orders, but sales haven’t kept pace. The company sold 25,583 Lightnings through November of this year, a 10% decrease from the prior-year period.

The successor to the F-150 Lightning, the T3 truck, was supposed to be built ground-up for production at a new complex in Tennessee, and be a core part of Ford’s second-generation EV lineup. Ford is now replacing production of the EV pickup with new gas-powered trucks starting in 2029 at the Tennessee factory.

Ford effectively killed the entirety of its announced second-generation of EV models with Monday’s announcement. For its future EV lineup, the company is shifting focus to more affordable EV models, conceived by a so-called skunkworks team in California. The first model from that team is slated to be priced at about $30,000 and go on sale in 2027. This midsize EV truck is being built at Ford’s Louisville plant.

He has a fresh perspective of the regulatory and enforcement landscape, a view sharpened by the demands of high-level public service.","When Raleigh partner Michael Easley took over as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina in 2021, federal prosecutors faced unprecedented challenges. The pandemic had set off a surge in violent crime and drug overdose deaths. Cybercrime and money laundering were increasing. The U.S. Attorney’s Office had to act quickly to combat these threats simultaneously.

Easley employed a skill he honed during his decade as a litigator at McGuireWoods: listening to clients to better understand their circumstances. In this case, that meant meeting with local sheriffs, police chiefs and officials from federal agencies like the FBI, DEA and SEC. Easley then reorganized the U.S. Attorney’s Office to address the district’s unique challenges.

“McGuireWoods instilled in me a mentality of client service and a work ethic and drive that great client service requires. In a role like U.S. attorney, your clients are the communities that you serve and the federal agency partners that you work with,” Easley says. “I wanted to deliver for the American taxpayer the kind of lawyering that our clients at McGuireWoods came to expect of us — and nothing less.”

Easley hired prosecutors to fill priority roles, advocated for more resources for the district and focused on dismantling transnational criminal enterprises. Over the next few years, homicides and violent crime in the district dropped.

Meanwhile, Easley built anti-money laundering and white-collar enforcement teams into a more muscular enforcement posture and created ways to track performance in those key areas. White collar criminal prosecutions rose by 115% in a single year, and federal agencies began strategically bringing cases to the Eastern District because of the quality of the teams prosecuting those cases, he says.

“We often said what gets measured gets managed, and we wanted to measure our performance and as we did, we saw a whole lot of progress in the reduction of violent crime and the volume of cases that we were able to take in the white collar space,” Easley says. “It created safer communities.”

A Model to Emulate

Easley joined McGuireWoods straight out of the University of North Carolina School of Law in 2010, attracted by the firm’s “energy and youth” and the opportunity to work on sophisticated white collar matters across the country as a junior attorney based in Raleigh. His work included litigation related to some of the biggest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history.

Easley found several mentors who helped him grow as an attorney and showed him how he could use his experiences to serve the public: Ken Bell, a former chief of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Charlotte and now a federal judge there; and retired partners Doug Ey, the firm’s former general counsel, and former McGuireWoods Chairman Richard Cullen, who served as a U.S. attorney in Virginia and as the commonwealth’s attorney general.

“Richard’s model of being a lawyer and a leader in his state and his nation was a model that I found attractive because public service has always been something that I’ve been drawn to as well,” Easley says. “The fact that the firm was so supportive of Richard’s forays in public service showed that a model like that was possible, and it made me want to try to emulate it.”

There’s also a long tradition of public service in Easley’s family. Both of his parents were prosecutors, and his father served as attorney general and then governor of North Carolina.

When Easley expressed interest in pursuing the U.S. attorney role, firm leaders offered enthusiastic support, he says. Cullen and several partners who served in U.S. Senate-confirmed positions — including John Moran, Pat Rowan and Ben Hatch — were instrumental in helping Easley prepare for his own confirmation process, he says. Ultimately, Easley emerged as a consensus choice who was nominated by President Joe Biden, approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and confirmed by the full Senate without opposition.

‘The Things I Love Are Even Truer Now’

After concluding his tenure as U.S. attorney in February 2025, Easley could have pursued almost any opportunity he liked. He was drawn home to McGuireWoods because of the talent the firm assembled and its relentless focus on practice areas and industry groups that have long been its core pillars, including healthcare, life sciences, energy, financial institutions and government investigations.

Easley was one for three former U.S. attorneys to join McGuireWoods in 2025, arriving along with partners Ryan Buchanan in Atlanta and Eric Olshan in Pittsburgh. In addition, Easley noted, the firm has built a deep bench by recruiting associates who served in some of the country’s most prestigious judicial clerkships. McGuireWoods’ strategic focus attracts talent, which in turn attracts clients, he says.

“In revisiting and getting reacquainted with the firm, it was obvious that all the things I love about McGuireWoods were even truer than when I left,” Easley says. “The commitment to excellence, the energy of the team, the sophistication of the lawyers and the quality of our client base, all of that is getting better and stronger every day.”

The insights Easley gained as a U.S. attorney complement those strengths. He has a fresh perspective of the regulatory and enforcement landscape, a view sharpened by the demands of high-level public service.

“That experience changes you. Leading a large team changes you. It draws out of you skills, talents and abilities that are hard to touch in a traditional law practice,” Easley says. “You emerge from a role like that with a lot more wisdom and perspective than you might see in a similarly experienced lawyer who hasn’t served in a senior role as a regulatory or enforcement lawyer.”",https://www.mcguirewoods.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/MW-social-media-icon.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 18:01:58.785115

As part of the move, the company is also taking a $19.5 billion write-down over the next three years, with the majority occurring in the fourth quarter of 2025.

The company says they are shifting to higher-return opportunities, a move which means the end of production of select larger electric vehicles. The move also means Ford's electric vehicle production will be focused on their universal EV platform, which is used for smaller, affordable models. The first vehicle to use this platform will be a midsize pickup truck assembled at the Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027. The Lightning will be shifted to an extended-range electric vehicle architecture and will still be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley in a news release. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids, and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

The company says under their new initiative, Ford's global volume of hybrids, extended-range EVs, and electric vehicles will rise to 50% by 2030 from the 17% today. However, the company says their BlueOval City complex, under construction in Tennessee, will now build new pickups.

The plant was once touted as ""leading the electric revolution by reimagining how electric vehicles and batteries are designed, built, and recycled.""

Once set to be named the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center, it has now been renamed Tennessee Truck Plant. Production of gas-powered trucks at the plant is set to start in 2029.

The company also says they will produce new gas and hybrid vans at the Ohio Assembly plant, and that they expect to hire thousands of new employees in the US over the next few years.

Ford is also moving into energy infrastructure, planning to produce battery energy storage systems using lithium iron phosphate technology at plants in Kentucky and Michigan. They say they will begin shipping these systems with 20 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity in 2027. Ford plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky facility will be used to produce larger systems, while the Marshall, Michigan, facility will produce smaller systems for residential uses, as well as LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming midsize electric truck.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/354627b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2Fdc%2Fd86829404804a33fb728907b259f%2Fap21208586856345.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 18:01:21.279592

2. A Korean battery maker ended its partnership with Ford

The South Korean battery manufacturer SK On canceled its partnership to work on electric vehicles with the Ford Motor Company, throwing the fate of the two companies’ three factories in the American Southeast into jeopardy. The announcement, E&E News reported, also casts doubt over the $9.6 billion loan the Biden administration gave the joint venture, known as Blue Oval SK. The collaboration came as American automakers teamed up with Korean battery companies to hasten the establishment of an EV supply chain. General Motors inked a deal with LG Energy Solution and Ford with SK On. But as sales of EVs flatline — due in part to President Donald Trump axing the federal tax credit for purchases of new electric vehicles — the nascent supply networks are withering on the vine. Ford isn’t down for the count, however. In August, as I wrote in the newsletter at the time, the company unveiled what it billed as its “Model T moment” for EVs, a whole new assembly line structure meant to scale up and iron out production of battery-powered cars.

3. Mark Carney’s climate pullback faces blowback

Prime Minister Mark Carney has scrapped Canada’s carbon tax, inked major oil and gas deals, and pumped the brakes on a scheme to boost electric vehicle sales. Now the leader of the Liberal Party is facing blowback from allies and sustainability-minded executives who say the reversals put Canada’s net-zero goals out of reach. The former environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, quit the cabinet in protest, as have two founding members of the federal government’s Net Zero Advisory Body. “From a climate-science standpoint, this risks undermining the urgency of emissions reduction,” Paul Polman, the former chief executive of home-goods giant Unilever and a campaigner for sustainable capitalism, told the Financial Times. “Betting heavily on unproven massive-scale CCS [carbon capture and storage] and a cleaner-oil narrative while accelerating production ... seems like a gamble with global emissions targets, and with the credibility of net zero by 2050. Gambling with firm science does not seem smart to me.”

4. Utility-scale batteries face heightened risk from cyberattacks

Utility-scale battery storage systems are facing increased risk of cyberattack from hackers working either for governments or criminal groups. That’s according to a white paper from the consultancies Brattle Group and Dragos. Battery deployments are expected to grow by as much as 45% in the next five years, raising the need for new protections against digital meddling. “Battery storage systems are being used across the grid to enable the deployment of variable demand sources such as solar and wind,” Phil Tonkin, field chief technology officer at Dragos, told Utility Dive’s sister publication Cybersecurity Dive. “This growing dependence makes them an attractive target.” Even relatively small-scale attacks can have devastating consequences. A single outage involving a 100-megawatt system for four hours in the U.S. would cost up to $1.2 million in revenue, the report found. A large-scale cyber attack that takes out 3,000 megawatts for a day would take a $39 million toll on the economy. Dragos is currently tracking as many as 18 groups that “are known to pose a threat to the electrical grid.”

5. France foresees ending oil consumption in as little as 15 years

Canada may be taking a U turn on climate policy, but France just updated its National Low-Carbon Strategy with an end date for using fossil fuels. The document “foresees the end of oil use between 2040 and 2045,” France24 reported, with natural gas phasing out by 2050. France is far ahead of most developed countries toward decarbonizing its power system since the nation has generated the majority of its electricity from nuclear reactors since the late 20th century. Under the plan, the French government expected electricity consumption to increase as heat pumps replace furnaces and electric vehicles swap in for diesel cars. Renewables are expected to cover the increase in electricity production.

THE KICKER

Conspiracy theorists who think condensation trails from airplanes are some kind of population-control chemical may have their hands full with the paranoia fodder that geoengineering efforts represent. But actual scientists at Leipzig University have made a discovery about contrails’ effect on warming. The researchers found that “hidden” contrails within naturally forming cirrus clouds — previously not factored into assessments — contribute up to 10% of the warming all contrails cause. “We now know that not only the visible contrails we see in the sky but also those that form within clouds need to be taken into account when assessing the impact of aviation on the climate,” Torsten Seelig, the study's lead author, said in a statement.

Perhaps you can tell: I am not among those who believe that the treaty has been a failure, although it would be difficult — in this politically arid moment — to call it a complete success. Yet the ensuing decade has seen real progress in limiting global temperature rise. When negotiators gathered to finalize the agreement, it seemed likely that global average temperatures could rise by 4 degrees Celsius by 2100, as compared to their pre-industrial level. Today, a rise from 2.5 to 3 degrees Celsius seems more likely.

And for a document that is often described as non-binding, or even as hortatory, Paris has had a surprisingly material influence on global politics in the ensuing years. During the negotiations, the small-island states — the three dozen or so countries most affected by near-term sea-level rise — successfully got the final text to recognize a “stretch goal” of limiting warming to just 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. They also tasked the United Nations’ advisory scientific body to prepare a special report on the virtues of avoiding 1.5 degrees of warming. When that report was released in 2018, it catalyzed a new wave of global climate action, spawning the European Green Deal — and eventually the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

Yet there is at least one way that Paris did not go as imagined.

Cast your mind back to Paris 10 years ago, right as diplomats filed in and began to applaud the final text’s completion. “This is a tremendous victory for all of our citizens — not for any one country or any one bloc, but for everybody here who has worked so hard to bring us across the finish line,” John Kerry, then the U.S. secretary of state, declared to his fellow diplomats.

It was a strange kind of victory. After decades in which western liberals had attempted to secure a globally binding climate treaty — an agreement that would limit each country’s greenhouse gas emissions — the world finally won a non-binding alternative. Under the Paris Agreement, each country would pledge to cut its emissions by as much as it could manage. Countries would then meet regularly to review these pledges, encourage each other to get more ambitious, and gradually ratchet the world into a lower-carbon future.

Kerry was reasonably direct about how such a mechanism would work: capital markets. “We are sending literally a critical message to the global marketplace,” he said. “Many of us here know that it won’t be governments that actually make the decision or find the product, the new technology, the saving grace of this challenge. It will be the genius of the American spirit.”

He was right, in a way: The Paris Agreement did send a signal to the global marketplace— and it did so in part because governments did shape policy and investment outcomes, not because they resisted doing so. But it did not reveal the genius of the American spirit, per se.

In the years running up to and following the Paris Agreement, China rolled out a series of important policies to boost its new energy sectors — a roadmap encouraging “new energy vehicle” sales in 2012, billions of consumer subsidies beginning in 2014, and a domestic content mandate for electric-vehicle batteries in 2015. These programs — along with canny decisions made by Chinese entrepreneurs and engineers, and no small amount of demand pull from companies and policies in the West — have transformed the world’s approach to decarbonization. They have begun to change even what decarbonization means — in the United States, in the western democracies, and around the world.

Ten years ago, Kerry could assume that any eventual solution to climate change would be geopolitically neutral, if not advantageous to the United States. But in 2025, to a degree that commentators still hesitate to describe, the climate story has become the China story. Across a range of sectors, how a country approaches its near-term decarbonization goals depends on how it understands and relates to the Chinese government and Chinese companies.

Consider the power sector, which generates just under a third of all greenhouse gas emissions globally. For many countries, the best way to cut carbon pollution — and to add more power generation to the grid — will be to build new utility-scale solar and battery projects. That will all but require working with Chinese firms, which dominate 80% of the solar supply chain. (They command up to 98% market share for some pieces of equipment, according to the International Energy Agency.)

It is much the same story in the grid-scale battery industry. China produces more than three-quarters of the world’s batteries, and it refines most of the minerals that go into those batteries. Its batteries are at least 20% cheaper than those made in Europe or North America. Most of the world’s top battery firms are Chinese — in part because they have more experience than anyone else; the country’s firms have manufactured 70% of all lithium-ion batteries ever produced. Nearly two dozen countries have bought at least $500 million in Chinese-made batteries this year, according to the think tank Ember.

What if a country wants to build wind turbines, not batteries? Even then, it will have to work to buy non-Chinese products. Although European and American firms have long led among turbine makers, six of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers are now in mainland China, according to BloombergNEF. And for the first time since analysts’ rankings began in 2013, none of the world’s top three turbine makers are North American or European.

Transportation generates another 13% of global climate emissions. If a country wants to tackle that sector, then it will find itself (again) working with China — which made more than 70% of the world’s EVs in 2024. Thanks to the country’s sprawling battery and electronics-making ecosystem, its home-grown automakers — BYD, Geely, Xiaomi, and others — can produce more affordable, innovative, and desirable EVs at greater scale and at lower cost than automakers anywhere else. “The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry,” Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, said recently. As the scholar Ilaria Mazzocco put it in a recent report: “Chinese companies are ubiquitous in the value chain for EVs and battery components, meaning that for most countries, climate policy is now at least in part linked to policy toward China, and more specifically trade with China.”

That insight — that climate policy is now linked to policy toward China — will apply more and more, even when countries wish to tackle the remaining third of emissions that come from energy-related sources. Earlier this year, China approved a plan to build roughly 100 low-carbon industrial parks by 2030, where its firms will develop new ways to capture carbon, make steel, and refine chemicals without carbon pollution. (The Trump administration revoked funding for similar low-carbon projects in the U.S. earlier this year.) At the same time, China is building more conventional nuclear reactors than the rest of the world combined, and it may be pulling ahead of the United States in the race to develop commercial fusion.

This wasn’t inevitable. It happened because Chinese politicians, executives, and engineers decided to make it happen — choices owing as much to the government’s focus on energy security as to its concern for the global environmental commons. But it was also the result of American business leaders and politicians squandering this country’s leadership in climate technologies — and especially the result of choices made by Trump administration officials, who at nearly every opportunity have regarded batteries and electric vehicles as a technological sideshow to the more profitable oil and gas sector.

It was the Trump administration, after all, that licensed and then eventually gave U.S.-funded research on flow batteries to a Chinese company in 2017. It was the Trump administration that gutted fuel economy and clean car rules in 2018 and 2019, setting the American car industry back compared to its Chinese and European competitors. And it was the Trump administration and congressional Republicans that killed electric vehicle tax credits earlier this year, further choking off investment.

For progressives, this all might suggest a pleasant parable: China embraced the energy transition, and America didn’t, and now America is paying for it. Nowadays, commentators often invoke China’s clean energy dominance to inspire awe at its accomplishments. And how can you not, in truth, be impressed? China’s industrial miracle — its move to the frontier of global technological development — is the most important story of the past quarter century. The scale of the Chinese consumer market and the success of Chinese industrial policy (or, at least, its success so far) has wrenched world history in new directions. And Chinese companies have done humanity a great service by bringing down the cost of solar panels, batteries, and EVs on the supply side, even if they did so at first with demand-side assistance from policies in California or Europe.

But climate advocates in North America and Europe cannot be completely sanguine about what this development means globally. For environmentalists and other western liberals who have worked in decarbonization for decades, it will in particular require some rhetorical and political adjustment. We cannot pretend that we are playing by the 1990s’ rules, nor that environmental activism is but one part of a post-1970s progressive coalition, which is free to make demands and ignore inconvenient trade-offs. Basic questions of decarbonization policy now have patent geopolitical significance, which environmental groups attempt to side-step at their own peril.

Yet it isn’t only Americans or Europeans who must answer these questions. China’s dominance of decarbonization technology means that for the time being, every country on Earth must address this dynamic. When the scholar Mazzocco looked at how six countries around the world are approaching Chinese EVs, she found an uneven landscape, she told me on a recent podcast. Costa Rica, which has long embraced climate policy, has welcomed Chinese-made EVs; Brazil opened its doors to them but has now begun to close it.

Most major countries have some form of domestic automaking industry; no country will be able to sit back and passively allow Chinese exports to drive their local automakers out of business. At the same time, China’s manufacturing primacy is already making conventional export-driven growth less attractive for countries. And that will only be the beginning of the dilemmas to come. As long as going green requires buying and integrating Chinese technologies into critical infrastructure, environmental policymakers will be wagering decarbonization’s success on some of the world’s highest stakes geopolitical bets.

Environmentalists have long insisted climate change is a national security issue, but are we ready to think and act like it is? Do Western anxieties about a large and globalized war — either a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a Russian invasion of the EU, or both — reflect a reasonable response to a real and growing menace, or an elite panic driven by our declining economic primacy? If China were to invade Taiwan, what would that mean for climate and energy policy — not only in the West, but around the world? Would American or European environmentalists even get a vote on that question — and if they do, how would they balance emissions reduction against other goals? If the unthinkable happens, we will all be called to account.

A decade ago, I remember watching the live stream of the world’s diplomats applauding their own success in Paris and realizing that I would be seeing that video in documentaries and news reels for the rest of my life. How will I see it then? I wondered. Would it strike me as the naivete of a simpler time, an era when liberal internationalism still seemed possible? Or would it really reflect a turning point, the moment when the world took the climate challenge seriously, pragmatically, and began to decarbonize in earnest? A decade later, I still don’t know. Perhaps the answer is both.

First, the hardware. Rivian said that the R2 will come with 11 camera and five radar units spread around the vehicle to improve the car’s ability to comprehend the world around it. But the crucial, headline-grabbing addition is a lidar, or light-based radar, unit. Lidar shoots laser pulses and measures the time it takes for the reflected light to return, thereby building a three-dimensional picture of the environment it surveys.

Those twirling bobs you might have seen on the top of Waymo’s driverless cars as they roam the streets, mapping the world around them, are lidar. The technology’s ability to see the world in detail across distances is necessary for the upper levels of automotive autonomy — the ones where the car can basically do it all and the humans can take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road.

Lidar units to date have been large and expensive, which is one reason they’re seen in pods that protrude from the top of a vehicle. Rivian, however, figured out how to mount one within the vehicle, in the area at the top of the front windshield near the rear-view mirror. The forward-facing lidar gives the vehicle 300 meters of forward vision. Demos the company showed during autonomy day revealed just how much more a constellation of cameras, radar, and lidar can see than a system without lidar, especially in dark or foggy conditions.

The other “wow” reveal on Thursday was that the R2 will process all that camera data on a chip that Rivian built from scratch to handle the AI and autonomous driving workload of its vehicles, rather than sourcing chips from some other tech company. CEO R.J. Scaringe said during his presentation to open the event that this kind of vertical integration was meant to allow the company to keep pace with the AI race as opposed to having to work with whatever third-party components it could get.

The result is a leap forward in capability over what Rivian offered with the R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck. Those vehicles had a hand-free system that let the EVs drive themselves with minimal human oversight on a little more than 100,000 miles of roads that were well-marked and well-mapped. James Philbin, the vice president of autonomy and AI, promised on Thursday that the lidar and processing improvements would allow hands-free driving on more than 3 million miles of roads — basically anywhere that the lines on the highway are clear enough for the R2’s cameras to see. And what’s next, Rivian promises, is true autonomy. The SUV will drive itself entirely from point to point when the conditions allow, and as the AI continuously improves over time, you might eventually see driverless Rivians out there competing with the likes of Waymo.

All this stuff costs money, of course. The Rivian Autonomy+ package would add $2,500 or a monthly fee of $50 to the purchase price. But the fact that this tech is coming to a car that starts in the $40,000s is telling. It is how many people will get their first taste of true vehicle autonomy.

Thursday’s event wasn’t all about self-driving, either. Rivian also built an AI software assistant for the cabin that can be summoned with a “Hey Rivian” and perform all kinds of in-car functions, such as changing the driving mode or adjusting the climate control. The achievement here is one of natural language. In Rivian’s demos, the assistant could ably fulfill the driver’s wishes with a command like “make it a little toastier in here” as opposed to formal instructional language like “turn the driver’s temperature to 70 degrees and set the seat heater to level one.”

At times this feels unnecessary, like AI looking for something to do to justify its existence. It doesn’t take that many button-pushes to alter the climate, after all. I admit, though, that having test-driven Rivians on road trips this summer, one of their weak points is my struggle to remember exactly which menu contains which controls. AI, in a way, helpfully solves a problem created by the modern EV that has amazing capability, but routes that capability through a large touchscreen that’s annoying (and dangerous) to navigate while driving.

Rivian is playing catch up with Tesla when it comes to autonomy, of course, as Elon Musk’s company has been touting its Full Self Driving feature for years and is now building the Cybercab, which is meant to be a car that humans will never drive. But Tesla has struggled to meet its timelines and targets for autonomous systems, giving rivals like Rivian a window to develop their own technology.

And so, what’s clear after Rivian’s event is that car companies, especially EV makers, are going to be key players in this autonomy and AI age. Nowhere was it written that electric vehicles had to be synonymous with self-driving vehicles. Battery-powered cars could be dumb and not smart, ruled by buttons instead of touchscreens. It just so happens that EVs are finally coming of age during the simultaneous ascent of artificial intelligence — and that the leading EV-only startups are Silicon Valley tech companies, or at least started out that way.

Tesla has forgotten about acting like a car company and staked its future on being the one that will crack true self-driving and reap the windfall. Rivian, which hadn’t made nearly as much noise about AI and autonomy before this week, has put forth a compelling case for its in-house autonomous systems and AI models, ones that will continue to improve as they’re trained on data provided by thousands of R2s hitting the road starting in 2026.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjM0Njg3Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4Nzc1NDY4MX0.KifDdoX996otk_d16TP2mjg_OEbO1CWKL6JjkzpprKg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-12-15 18:00:56.443544

Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, said it will stop making the F-150 Lightning in its electric vehicle form, but will pivot to producing an extended-range electric model, a version of a hybrid vehicle called an Erev, which uses a gas-powered generator to recharge the battery.

The company is also scrapping a next-generation electric truck, codenamed the T3, as well as planned electric commercial vans.

Instead, Ford said it will pivot hard into gas and hybrid models, and eventually hire thousands of workers, even though there will be some layoffs at a jointly owned Tennessee battery plant in the near term. The company expects its global mix of hybrids, extended-range EVs and pure EVs to reach 50% by 2030, from 17% today.

Ford will spread out the writedown, taken primarily in the fourth quarter and continuing through next year and into 2027, the company said. About $8.5bn is related to cancelling planned EV models. Around $6bn is tied to the dissolution of a battery joint venture with South Korea’s SK On, and $5bn on what Ford called “program-related expenses”.

Ford’s shift reflects the auto industry’s response to waning demand for battery-powered models, after car companies plowed hundreds of billions of dollars into EV investments early this decade. The outlook for electrics dimmed significantly this year as Donald Trump’s policies yanked federal support for EVs and eased tailpipe-emissions rules, which could encourage carmakers to sell more gas-powered cars.

US sales of electric vehicles fell about 40% in November, following the September 30 expiration of a $7,500 consumer tax credit, which had been in place for more than 15 years to stoke demand. The Trump administration also included in the massive tax and spending bill that passed in July a freeze on fines that automakers pay for violating fuel-economy regulations.

“Rather than spending billions more on large EVs that now have no path to profitability, we are allocating that money into higher-returning areas,” said Andrew Frick, head of Ford’s gas and electric-vehicle operations.

The F-150 Lightning rolled off assembly lines starting in 2022 with much fanfare Comedian Jimmy Fallon wrote a song about the truck. Ford increased production of the model to meet an influx of 200,000 orders, but sales haven’t kept pace.

The company sold 25,583 Lightnings through November of this year, a 10% decrease from the prior-year period.

The successor to the F-150 Lightning, the T3 truck, was supposed to be built ground-up for production at a new complex in Tennessee, and be a core part of Ford’s second-generation EV lineup. Ford is now replacing production of the EV pickup with new gas-powered trucks starting in 2029 at the Tennessee factory.

Ford effectively killed the entirety of its announced second-generation of EV models with Monday’s announcement.

For its future EV lineup, the company is shifting focus to more affordable EV models, conceived by a so-called skunkworks team in California. The first model from that team is slated to be priced at about $30,000 and go on sale in 2027.

In connection with the completion of the transaction, Motiv’s legacy controlling investor has provided Workhorse with up to $50 million in new debt financing capacity, of which approximately $10 million is available in a revolving credit facility and up to an additional $40 million is available to fund supply-chain related costs associated with new purchase orders. In addition to materially reducing time from order-to-delivery, these financings are expected to provide significant liquidity to fund growth.

“At Workhorse, we’re not just building electric trucks, we’re building better trucks. Our software-first electric trucks are powerful, cost-efficient, reliable, safe, and comfortable—all with zero tailpipe emissions and pollution,” said Scott Griffith, who became CEO of Workhorse upon the close of the transaction. “Workhorse trucks perform the same or better as their internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, while costing far less over the lifetime of the vehicle.”

“Looking ahead,” Griffith continued, “we are going to build on our 20-plus year combined legacy in electrification and the thousand-plus electric trucks and buses we have delivered to meet the needs of our growing customer base. In doing so, we believe we are positioned to drive profitable growth, create value for our shareholders and customers and deliver on our Better Trucks, Better World ambition.”

Workhorse is poised to create value for shareholders and customers by:

Producing the best truck, period. Advanced safety, telematics, and ergonomics combined with superior cost and maintenance advantages position Workhorse to capture market share in the medium-duty truck and bus space.

Building on significant commercial fleet traction. Workhorse has served 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets owned by some of the biggest and most respected brands in North America and enters 2026 with a strong sales pipeline and backlog of orders for trucks, step vans, school buses, and shuttles.

Leveraging existing world-class in-house manufacturing. With a nameplate capacity of 5,000+ vehicles per year in place, Workhorse has the ability to produce the annual number of vehicles it believes is required to reach profitability without the need for significant new capital expenditures at its manufacturing plant in Indiana.

Applying learnings from the Stables project. Workhorse also owns and operates a mix of gas and electric step vans in a FedEx Ground Independent Service Provider (ISP) fleet through its Stables project. This real-world test bed, operating in Ohio, brings real-time data on trucks in service and an operator mindset to the Workhorse design process, resulting in purpose-built features, direct feedback from depot managers and drivers, deeper insights into range and route planning, and extended durability testing.

Benefiting from an experienced management team. The combined management team has a proven track record of designing great products, selling to commercial fleets, and scaling manufacturing in the automotive space.

Putting growth capital to work. With a clean balance sheet, up to $50 million of added debt capacity, and access to the public capital markets, Workhorse has immediate capability to both drive new and fulfil existing orders for trucks and buses.

Experienced and Proven Executive Leadership

As of the close of the merger, Workhorse will have a refreshed, highly qualified board and management team comprising: Scott Griffith, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Ginnan, Chief Financial Officer; James Griffin, Chief Revenue Officer; Scott Zion, Chief Product Officer; and Josh Anderson, Executive Vice President of Operations. The combined company’s Board is comprised of seven directors, five designated by Motiv, including Scott Griffith and Matthew O’Leary, who will be Chairman. Additional information on the Board is available at ir.workhorse.com .

Going forward, Workhorse will initially be headquartered in the Wixom, Michigan area, with plans to expand to a larger presence in the Detroit metro area. The Company will also retain a presence in Cincinnati, Ohio and the Bay Area of California. It will continue to produce vehicles out of the Workhorse Ranch, its commercial-scale manufacturing facility, in Union City, Indiana. The 436,000 sq. ft., 92.6 acre facility has an annual capacity of 5,200 vehicles and includes production, logistics and a customer training center. The site also includes another 200,000 sq. ft. of vehicle storage space and a Noise, Vibration, Handling test track (NVH).

It was the year that our federal government was largely handed over to the fossil fuel industry, resulting in unprecedented attacks on our environmental safeguards and public lands. Our nation’s “leaders” now seek to divide us. We saw targeted attacks on our neighbors based on the color of their skin, and the scientists and other professionals who protect our Great Lakes, public health, and enforce the law against polluters have come under scrutiny.

And while we all live in this country, at the same time, here in Illinois we are fighting for a very different future.

A basic law of science holds that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and 2025 gave us hope that we can make that happen here in our Prairie State. Here’s a few highlights of what we’ve been able to accomplish, even against these unprecedented federal headwinds:

A 1-2 Punch For Deep Cuts In Climate Pollution From Power and Transportation

In one day this fall, we and our Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition partners won two historic victories for climate on the final day of the Illinois legislative session when the General Assembly passed bold legislation to fix and fund public transit. The Northern Illinois Transit Authority Act provides stable funding for reliable, safe transit service to downstate and the Chicago region. In the years to come we will see new train and bus service, and safer, cleaner rides that give people affordable alternatives to driving alone. The transportation sector is Illinois’ largest source of carbon emissions, and this legislation will help us lower those emissions by giving people more options outside of driving.

On the same day, we passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act to address rising electric bills by adding more wind, solar, and batteries to our power grid, which will help address the power crunch caused by massive new data centers coming for our electric supply. This will help ensure Illinois meets the 100% clean energy goal we set in 2021, even while Trump and his fossil fuel cronies repealed America’s pro-renewable energy policies.

Holding Trump Tower Chicago Accountable for Clean Water Act Violations

When our clean water team discovered that Chicago’s Trump Tower cut corners and violated the Clean Water Act, jeopardizing recovering fish populations in the Chicago River, we teamed up with Friends of the Chicago River to seek justice. In June announced the largest Clean Water Act penalty in Illinois history, that will require Trump Tower to upgrade its river protection equipment, and fund new habitat restoration projects to continue the river’s ecological recovery.

New Protections for Illinois’ Shawnee National Forest

While the Trump administration keeps looking for ways to allow exploitation of our public lands, we teamed up with Senator Dick Durbin to strengthen protections for three key areas of Illinois’ Shawnee National Forest. The Shawnee National Forest Conservation Act of 2025 would establish the Camp Burke Branch, Camp Hutchins, and Ripple Hollow Special Management Areas, protecting them from any commercial extraction activity while allowing for active management of these natural areas, and establish a new Wilderness Area within Camp Hutchins. The proposal received bipartisan support in passing the Senate Agriculture Committee and we’re hopeful it can become law in 2026.

Protecting Central Illinois Drinking Water From Carbon Pollution

Many companies have targeted central Illinois for carbon capture and sequestration projects. Someday, this unproven technology may prove to be a solution for hard to decarbonize heavy industries, but injecting carbon waste deep underground also poses risks, especially to drinking water. Over 1 million Illinoisans depend on the Mahomet Aquifer as their sole source of drinking water, and we worked to pass legislation banning the practice of injecting carbon through and under the Mahomet to protect this vital groundwater resource.

Solidarity With Those Under Attack

New threats brought new and strengthened alliances with progressive partners as we raised our voices to protect our neighbors and public servants from the harm and hate in Trump’s agenda. From standing with EPA scientists and other professionals losing their jobs and with our coalition partners in Illinois’ immigrant communities, to joining partners in organizing events like the #NoKings and #HandsOffChicago mass mobilizations, we are building power to resist attacks on our democracy and our future, and for Illinois to chart a different course.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-15 22:00:17.744048

Finally, we turn to H.R.","As prepared for delivery:

Good afternoon, the Committee will come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time.

Today, the Rules Committee is convening to consider six separate measures: H.R. 845, H.R. 1366, H.R. 3616, H.R. 3632, H.R. 4371, and H.R. 4776.

H.R. 845, the Pet and Livestock Protection Act, would require the Secretary of the Interior to reissue regulations removing the gray wolf from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.

Legal activism on the part of progressive judges has bound the hands of states and prevented them from enacting their own rules and regulations related to managing their grey wolf populations

As a result, our nation’s agriculture community has become even more vulnerable to these predators.

This legislation restores decision making authority to those who best understand the local needs of farmers and ranchers.

H.R. 1366, the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, would provide for the location of multiple hardrock mining mill sites and would establish the Abandoned Hardrock Mine Fund that would conduct abandoned hardrock mine reclamation.

Mineral production remains essential to supporting America’s standing within the global energy marketplace as well as strengthening our competitive edge against our adversaries.

This bipartisan piece of legislation will help dissolve bureaucratic roadblocks, unleash even more economic prosperity, and meet the overwhelming demand for more mineral production right here at home.

To make sizable progress on building out our nation’s mineral supply chain, it’s imperative that we pass this legislation.

H.R. 3616, the Reliable Power Act, would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review regulations that may affect the reliable operation of the bulk-power system.

As has been said many times before, the demand for electricity is rising in America – we know this to be true, and we cannot afford to put off addressing this important issue.

This legislation acts as a safeguard against overbearing federal regulations that threaten the strength and reliability of America’s power system.

The previous administration smothered our nation’s electric grid with red tape to the detriment of all Americans – that damage must be undone.

H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act of 2025, would authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to require electricity-generating facilities to continue operating under certain conditions to ensure reliable service on the bulk power system.

The bill amends section 207 of the Federal Power Act to clarify the process by which a state Commission or transmission organization can file a complaint with FERC to furnish adequate service if interstate service of a public utility is found to be inadequate or insufficient.

This is yet another positive piece of legislation that not only works to ensure the reliability of electricity for Americans across the nation, but it also places an important focus on maintaining grid reliability within the states.

H.R. 4371, the Kayla Hamilton Act, would amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to enhance efforts to combat the trafficking of children.

Three and a half years ago, in July of 2022, Kayla Hamilton, a young woman who this legislation is named in honor of, was murdered by an illegal alien from El Salvador who was allowed to enter the U.S. under the Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) program.

Instances of violent crime committed by UACs released to sponsors, such as in Kayla Hamilton’s case, are part of a larger, disturbing pattern that must be confronted.

This legislation is designed to prevent tragedies like Kayla’s murder by requiring HHS to request UACs’ criminal records from their home countries.

Further, it requires UACs with convictions for certain serious crimes to be placed in a secure facility, imposes stronger background checks and criminal history requirements for sponsors and adult members of their household, and closes a loophole in current law that allows illegal aliens to serve as UAC sponsors.

Finally, we turn to H.R. 4776, the SPEED Act, that would amend the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to clarify ambiguous provisions and facilitate a more efficient, effective, and timely environmental review process.

Republicans and Democrats should agree that America’s permitting process remains a fundamental roadblock in ensuring that every American has access to reliable, affordable, and low-emissions energy.

This bipartisan legislation, at its core, is about good stewardship of the environment – and eliminating the bureaucratic constraints that push America further away from economic and environmental prosperity.

We have a very good slate of bills here today, and I look forward to the discussions we’ll have.

With that, I now yield to the Ranking Member, Mr. McGovern, for any comments he wishes to make.

BATCHEWANA FIRST NATION

************************

Batchewana First Nation (“BFN”) and Alamos Gold Inc. (“Alamos”) are advancing the next phase of the Mine Connector Transmission Project, a key initiative that will deliver clean, reliable energy to the Algoma District and support the continued growth of Alamos’ Island Gold district.

An expropriation application has been filed with the Ontario Energy Board related to the Mine Connector Transmission Project. This represents an important milestone in ensuring the project moves forward in a manner that supports Ontario’s clean energy objectives and delivers lasting benefits for the region.

“Batchewana First Nation’s energy strategy is rooted in sustainability, economic growth and reconciliation,” said Chief Mark McCoy of Batchewana First Nation.

“By investing in transmission and renewable energy projects, we are supporting Ontario’s clean energy transition, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and strengthening our local economy. These projects reflect the principles of Truth and Reconciliation by advancing Indigenous-led development, creating equitable opportunities and ensuring respectful stewardship of our lands for future generations.”

The Mine Connector Transmission Project builds on the partnership announced earlier this year between BFN and Alamos for the construction of a new 115-kilovolt transmission line to the Island Gold district. The line, expected to be in service by 2026, will be owned and operated by Batchewana First Nation, marking a major step toward Indigenous energy leadership and long-term economic self-determination.

“This line is more than infrastructure. It’s a partnership with Batchewana First Nation that supports Indigenous-led economic development, as well as a shared commitment to clean energy and sustainable development,” said John A. McCluskey, president and chief executive officer of Alamos Gold. “Once complete, the line will connect our mining operation to Ontario’s clean electricity grid and help us reduce our greenhouse gas emission intensity to 70 per cent below the industry average.”

The Mine Connector Transmission Project delivers broad public interest benefits for both the local community and Ontario’s energy system. It builds technical and organizational capacity within Batchewana First Nation to manage large-scale infrastructure, while creating new opportunities for community-owned enterprises and local partnerships.

These outcomes foster inclusive economic development, entrepreneurship and the growth of long-term, sustainable employment across the Algoma region.

Equally important, the project represents a strategic milestone in environmental stewardship. As the first transmission project developed and owned by Batchewana First Nation, it strengthens the Nation’s leadership role in the clean energy transition. By enabling the delivery of renewable electricity to mining operations, the project reduces reliance on fossil fuels, lowers greenhouse gas emissions and aligns with BFN’s deep cultural commitment to caring for the land.

This initiative is also a catalyst for regional growth. By supporting the responsible expansion of the Island Gold district and attracting third-party investment, the project helps diversify the local economy and ensures that the benefits of development are shared broadly and sustainably throughout the Algoma District.

Better known as NEPA, the 55-year-old law requires all federal agencies to consider and review the environmental effects of proposed projects requiring federal permits, including pipelines, highways, transmission lines, and much more.

Critics of the law have long insisted that NEPA does more harm than good by acting as red tape, opening the door for extensive legal challenges and slowing domestic infrastructure development.

Wright echoed this concern on Monday at the American Leadership in Energy Innovation Summit, calling NEPA a “massive problem.”

He said when NEPA was passed in 1970, its primary purpose was to serve as a “check,” requiring projects touching federal lands or federal funds to review what the effect on the environment could be. However, he said the law is no longer used in this way.

“It got turned into something completely different,” he said. “This is a weaponization, a 10-year legal stop on anyone from building anything by suing them on NEPA. That’s not what NEPA was about to begin with.”

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has broadly endorsed efforts in Congress to pass bipartisan permitting reform without specifically backing specific bills.

Last week, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Congress should consider any bill that results in a permit taking less time, costing less money, and providing more certainty.

Wright made similar comments on Monday, saying, “I hope we can get a bipartisan permitting reform bill done that’s broad-based, just quicker to get permits or stable to get permits easy, just lower risk to start planning to build things again.”

The House is poised to vote on a permitting reform bill specifically targeting the bedrock environmental law.

This week, the House is also expected to vote on the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, better known as the SPEED Act.

Introduced by House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR), the SPEED Act would broadly overhaul and simplify NEPA and the scope of review required for environmental analyses by removing requirements to consider or conduct new scientific or technical research.

The bill would also mandate that federal agencies are not permitted to delay the issuance of an environmental review document or decision on the basis of waiting for new scientific research to be released.

Additionally, the SPEED Act would limit agencies’ ability to include downstream environmental effects associated with projects in a review and shorten the statute of limitations for legal challenges against projects subject to environmental reviews.

The bill has support among oil and gas industry executives, manufacturing trade groups, and several House Democrats.

However, a handful of House conservatives have threatened to tank the bill, saying offshore wind could benefit from the reforms, which would thwart the administration’s crackdown on renewables.

Some members of the House Freedom Caucus have targeted an amendment included late last month that would limit the president’s ability to revoke permits for certain projects.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ae535b22-b250-11ea-82f6-ab962d97a568.webp,N,,2025-12-15 17:02:14.146789

For the freshman class of the 119th Congress, it’s been a year like no other.

Republicans began with the narrowest House majority in almost a century, and that wasn’t the only thing that made 2025 stand out. Rank-and-file members aired their frustration by trying to sidestep leadership and bring their own bills to the floor, filing an unusually large stack of discharge petitions, and not just on the Epstein files.

Throw in a record-shattering government shutdown and a 54-day break as Speaker Mike Johnson kept the House floor closed for business, and what counts as a “normal” Congress was changing before their eyes.

It could have been worse, some newcomers said.

“Way better than I expected. Having never been in politics before, I expected it to be a lot worse,” said Rep. David Taylor, R-Ohio. “It was kind of a blank slate.”

Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., arrived in April to replace Mike Waltz, who resigned to become Donald Trump’s national security adviser.

“People often ask me, am I having fun? And the answer to that is no, but I didn’t come here to have a good time,” said Fine, one of five members so far to join this Congress midstream after winning a special election.

“My path to get here was unexpected. A lot of people thought about running for Congress for a long time. I got a call from President Trump, and then I was running,” he added.

The expectations game was not one she wanted to play, said Rep. Laura Friedman, D-Calif., a former state lawmaker who once worked in Hollywood as a film executive.

“I didn’t really think of what it was going to be like. I didn’t come in with any pre-expectations,” said Friedman, who emerged from last year’s crowded race to succeed now-Sen. Adam B. Schiff.

On a five-star scale, being on Capitol Hill can veer from one extreme to the other, she said.

“The experience is a five, an incredible honor, but the working environment here is a one, because of the chaos, partisan-ness, and just the destruction of our government that Congress has stood by and allowed,” Friedman said. “Watching DOGE destroy agencies and taxpayer investments without any congressional oversight is a stain on this body that will remain forever.”

‘Watching the Democrats go nuts’

Making Democrats sweat over a rapidly changing bureaucracy was one of the best parts of the year, according to some.

Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, came to Congress promising to “demolish the woke and weaponized administrative bureaucracy.” The youngest GOP member at age 31, he was named class president by his fellow Republican freshmen.

Asked to sum up the highlights of 2025, he put it this way: “Passing a major rescissions bill, passing the tax reconciliation bill that we did earlier in the year and watching the Democrats go nuts over it.”

Many Republicans were in a celebratory mood as the House sped toward its holiday break, despite internal rumblings that only grew louder in recent weeks after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced she would resign and blasted the speaker over how he’s handled his narrow majority.

“We’re now, once again, the most powerful country on the planet. The economy is picking up,” said Rep. Tim Moore, R-N.C., who served as speaker of the North Carolina House before he arrived on the Hill. “The only real disappointment that I had was the shutdown, and I was really disappointed in my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.”

Wins and losses aside, several Democrats said they worried for the institution of Congress itself, describing the feeling that norms and powers are slipping away.

“It’s been a really, really challenging year, and I don’t say that as a Democrat, I say that as a legislative branch snob who also happens to represent 45,000 federal employees and two to three times that amount in contractors,” said Rep. Sarah Elfreth, D-Md., who started her career in 2011 as a congressional intern. “This administration has made life a living hell for a lot of those people, and unfortunately, the checks and balances that our founders established in our Constitution for the legislative branch to exercise in just this very moment are not being exercised.”

Rep. Emily Randall, D-Wash., echoed those concerns.

“My dad was a Republican and I served with Republicans in the legislature who would wave around the Constitution as, like, what they stood for. The disregard for separation of powers and checks and balances [in Congress] is horrifying,” she said.

Still, compared to the Washington state Senate, she sees another difference: “I had one full-time staffer as a legislator, and now I have multiple offices of incredibly eager and smart and dedicated and passionate mostly young people who inspire me every day.”

New job, same as the old job?

More than 14 percent of all members were new to the House this year, even if some were no strangers to Washington.

“It’s a fascinating dynamic for me, because of course, I worked for President Trump for eight years,” said Rep. Brian Jack, R-Ga., who served Trump and his campaign in various roles, including as White House political director. “I deeply appreciate the power of relationships in being successful in this institution. … So thankfully, it was refreshing relationships, as opposed to building relationships.”

For Rep. Michael Baumgartner, R-Wash., a bipartisan trip this spring with House Armed Services ranking member Adam Smith and others brought him full circle. Baumgartner once worked at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, and said he also met his wife while working in the Middle East.

“It was my first time back in Iraq since 2008, so that was meaningful,” he said.

For those who once served in full-time state legislatures, the day-to-day rhythms of Congress can feel familiar, but the scale and stakes are different, some said.

“Coming from … a full-time state legislature in Pennsylvania, I was very familiar with the processes and the patterns. The challenges at the federal level are just much bigger, and so that requires more challenging solutions,” said Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa.

Asked how he would rate his freshman experience in Congress, Mackenzie said it wasn’t over yet.

“You really have to look at the totality of a term,” he said. “There’s a lot of work that’s still in the process, a lot of things still to be done.”

Power Generation

Geothermal energy’s high capacity factor—generally about 90%—allows geothermal power plants to operate 24 hours a day, with steady output nearly all of the time. As a steady power generator, geothermal electricity is ideal for supporting the energy load generated by constant data center operations, such as that required by some AI data computing, as well as flexible computing loads like those of bitcoin mining, which can fluctuate between periods of high uptime (or regular operation) and reductions in response to market price sensitivities.

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and other next-generation technologies can also provide versatile support for data centers’ high energy demands by removing or reducing power plant location limitations. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) is researching ways to improve geothermal exploration, reduce drilling costs, and advance next-generation technologies like EGS, helping to open more opportunities for cost-effective geothermal electricity nationwide.

Direct Cooling

Geothermal energy has the potential to reduce data center peak cooling demand and energy costs with Cold Underground Thermal Energy Storage (Cold UTES). Cold UTES is basically cold water that is injected into the subsurface, stored underground, then drawn back to the surface to be dispatched as needed to offset peak cooling demands.

Data centers can have large, megawatt-scale cooling demands to keep their servers operational, especially in times of high usage. Reducing the power required to meet peak cooling demand can mean avoiding the need to build new power plant capacity. As a long duration energy storage solution, Cold UTES offers a way to reduce and shift data center peak cooling loads, reducing demands on the electricity grid, while also improving cooling efficiency compared with other cooling methods.

GTO is supporting work to understand the grid and system-wide value, costs, and impacts(link is external) of large scale and widespread deployment of this emerging cooling solution.

GTO is also funding a project to investigate the use of abandoned mine water for data center cooling at a site in Southwest Virginia. Located on former and abandoned coal mine lands, the site has access to billions of gallons of cool underground water below these former mines. The project team will drill two entries to the underground mine workings and circulate water through them; cool water will be brought up from the subsurface to absorb heat from a facility and then reinjected back into the underground pool to be cooled by the surrounding pool and subsurface temperatures. The project will test the sustainability of this concept of creating a “cold energy reserve” underground for data center cooling.",https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-12/GeoEverywhere_DataCenters_Q42025.png,N,,2025-12-15 19:01:08.104820

This creates opportunities to access additional geothermal resources and even to repurpose idle or unproductive oil and gas wells for geothermal electricity generation.","The United States leads the world in geothermal electricity-generating capacity—just over 4 gigawatts.

To generate power from geothermal systems, three elements are needed:

Heat—Abundant heat found in rocks deep underground, varying by depth, geology, and geographic location.

Fluid—Sufficient fluid to carry heat from the rocks to the earth’s surface.

Permeability—Small pathways that facilitate fluid movement through the hot rocks.

The presence of hot rocks, fluid, and permeability underground creates natural geothermal systems. Small underground pathways, such as fractures, conduct fluids through the hot rocks. In geothermal electricity generation, this fluid can be drawn as energy in the form of heat through wells to the earth’s surface. Once it has reached the surface, this fluid is used to drive turbines that produce electricity.

Geothermal Power Generation Technologies

Conventional hydrothermal resources naturally contain all three elements needed for power generation. Sometimes, though, these conditions do not exist naturally—for instance, the rocks are hot, but they lack permeability or sufficient fluid flow.

Next-generation geothermal technologies create the conditions needed for geothermal power production. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) use human-made reservoirs to create the proper conditions for electricity generation by injecting fluid into the hot rocks. This creates new fractures and opens existing ones to enhance the size and connectivity of fluid pathways. Once this engineered reservoir is created, fluid can be injected into the subsurface and then drawn up through a production well to generate electricity using the same processes as a conventional hydrothermal system.

Closed loop geothermal systems do not rely on a fracture network. Instead, these systems are somewhat akin to a “radiator”—a series of closed pipes underground that circulate water and working fluids to absorb heat from the subsurface and bring it to the surface to produce power.

Superhot geothermal systems tap resources at >375°C. Water injected into these extremely hot environments becomes so hot that it has the properties of both liquids and gases, allowing the superheated water to gather very large volumes of heat energy. At the surface, it can be used to produce power at several times the power density (amount of power per unit volume) than lower-temperature rock.

The 2019 GeoVision analysis concluded that, with advancements in EGS, geothermal electricity-generating capacity could reach at least 60 gigawatts by 2050. Updated U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analysis(link is external) found that the potential was even higher, with technical advances enabling at least 90 gigawatts of geothermal electricity-generating capacity across the United States by 2050.

The DOE Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) is also assessing opportunities to use sedimentary geothermal resources to produce electricity. Sedimentary rock formations(link is external) commonly associated with oil and gas can also hold significant amounts of thermal energy. This creates opportunities to access additional geothermal resources and even to repurpose idle or unproductive oil and gas wells for geothermal electricity generation.",https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/Salton%20Sea%20Geothermal%20Power%20Plant_Credit%20Jeremy%20Snyder.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 22:00:22.358450

Ford just took a $19.5 billion writedown, shelving several electric vehicle projects as shifting US policy and sliding demand steer the Detroit automaker back toward gas and hybrid models.

What does this mean?

Ford’s turnaround underlines a rocky patch for electric vehicles in the US. After tallying $19.5 billion in hits—$8.5 billion from cancelled EVs and another $6 billion linked to unwinding a battery joint venture—Ford is pausing production on its all-electric F-150 Lightning. Instead, the company is leaning into hybrids and extended-range EVs (EREVs), aiming for these electrified models to make up half of its sales by 2030, a big jump from 17% today. Ford is also shelving its next-gen “T3” electric truck and electric commercial vans, effectively downsizing its second-generation EV lineup. These strategic cuts come as changes in federal policy—ending the EV tax credit and easing penalties for missed fuel efficiency goals—have led to a 40% plunge in US EV sales in November, giving buyers more reasons to stick with traditional gas-powered cars.

Why should I care?

For markets: Hybrids take the wheel in a shifting industry.

Ford’s raised 2025 earnings goal—from $6–6.5 billion to $7 billion—makes its change in direction clear to investors. Despite job cuts at its Tennessee battery facility, the company plans to ramp up hiring elsewhere as it boosts production of gas and hybrid trucks. The 10% annual dip in F-150 Lightning sales and the sudden refocus of resources are cues for the auto industry: legacy automakers that poured resources into EVs are now quick to pivot back to hybrids and gas models, prioritizing steadier profits over riskier electric bets.

“The dashboard shows that competitiveness varies widely across the region.” Trey Gowdy, Research Lead For Energy And Climate Policy, Nicholas Institute","Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability has launched a new interactive resource designed to help stakeholders compare the competitiveness of the power sector across the Southeast, offering a state-by-state view of policies and market features that shape how utilities, regulators, producers, and consumers interact.

Called the Southeast Power Sector Competitiveness Dashboard, the tool compiles key metrics tied to the region’s electricity policy environment and market design. It covers Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, aiming to provide policymakers, industry participants across the energy value chain, researchers, market analysts, and civil society organizations with a single place to evaluate differences that are often spread across multiple sources.

The dashboard assigns each state a score based on 15 competitiveness indicators grouped into three areas: consumer-oriented policies and programs that affect choices in electricity usage, providers, or rates; structural factors such as laws, utility structures, and regulations that influence large-scale market operations; and market participation in multi-state markets and transmission organizations that manage large-scale dispatch.

In the 2025 view, Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky rank highest overall, while Alabama ranks lowest, followed by Tennessee and Georgia. The Nicholas Institute said states received between 22% and 60% of all available points, suggesting that even higher-scoring states have room to improve.

The tool is built to go beyond overall rankings by letting users drill into category performance and compare indicators across states. The Nicholas Institute noted that Georgia, despite ranking near the bottom overall, leads in consumer-facing policies. Kentucky leads the structure category, and Louisiana ranks highest in the market category.

Alongside the core scoring system, the dashboard includes a policy simulator that allows users to test hypothetical changes and see how specific policy moves could affect a state’s competitiveness score. The platform also provides additional context, including state-specific descriptions of competitiveness-related policies, the five largest utilities by market share in each state, consumer and environmental conditions such as average electricity bills, generation mix, and outage data, and an overview of integrated resource planning timelines by state.

The Nicholas Institute leads the project and builds on earlier work framing power sector competition as a continuum rather than a binary distinction. It is supported by the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation and is produced in concert with complementary work led by the World Resources Institute. The Nicholas Institute team also introduced the dashboard’s interactive features and information during a webinar on Dec. 11.

Partners from academia and industry are developing the required materials and production technologies in the joint project DINERWA. They also aim to produce components for testing under conditions similar to those in a reactor.

Materials for Extreme Conditions

The project’s main focus is on developing durable structural and functional materials that can resist the high temperatures and neutron fluxes inside reactors as long as possible so that the costs of first wall maintenance and associated power plant shutdown can be minimized. In addition to new oxide dispersion-strengthened (ODS) steel alloys and copper-based materials, the project team is also investigating nanostructured tungsten and high-entropy alloys. Furthermore, the team is working on new production processes and joining techniques for assembling the materials in complex modules. “Our aim is to take a major step toward making fusion power plants economically viable by substantially extending the first wall’s service life and enabling the industrial production of its parts,” said Professor Wolfgang Theobald, Experimental Lead at Focused Energy, a laser fusion company, and DINERWA project manager.

KIT is supervising the scientific research for materials development, with IAM researchers developing and characterizing the new ODS steels and copper alloys. The partners then apply the lab results to the production of components for tests at KIT’s HELOKA (Helium Loop Karlsruhe) facility for high heat flux testing, where they can be analyzed under the conditions expected in a fusion reactor. “We aim to show that these materials perform well not only in the lab but also remain stable under real operating conditions,” said Bonnekoh, who heads the research effort at KIT. “We’re establishing the basis for actually using today’s experimental materials in tomorrow’s reactor components.”

The company is shifting to higher-return opportunities, including leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint to add trucks and vans to its lineup and launch a new, high-growth battery energy storage business. As part of these actions, Ford no longer plans to produce select larger electric vehicles where the business case has eroded due to lower-than-expected demand, high costs and regulatory changes.

This approach prioritizes affordability, choice and profits. Ford will expand powertrain choice – including a range of hybrids and extended-range electric propulsion – while focusing its pure electric vehicle development on its flexible Universal EV Platform for smaller, affordable models.

“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” said Ford president and CEO Jim Farley. “The operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities: Ford Pro, our market-leading trucks and vans, hybrids and high-margin opportunities like our new battery energy storage business.”

These actions provide a path to profitability in Model e by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The actions will also improve profits in Ford Blue and Ford Pro over time with early signs of benefits in 2026. As a result, Ford expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items, the majority in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the remainder in 2026 and 2027. As part of these special items, the company expects approximately $5.5 billion in cash effects, with the majority paid in 2026 and the remainder in 2027.

To support these actions, Ford and its subsidiaries plan to hire thousands of people across America, reinforcing the company’s leadership as the top employer of U.S. hourly autoworkers.

The evolved strategy is built on four key pillars.

Expanding Customer Choice with Gas, Hybrids and Low-Cost Electric Vehicle Platform

By 2030, Ford expects approximately 50% of its global volume will be hybrids, extended-range EVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.

Ford will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform. This next-generation architecture is engineered to underpin a high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles designed to be accessible to millions of customers.

The first vehicle from the Universal EV Platform will be the fully connected midsize pickup truck assembled at Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.

Ford plans to expand hybrids with a range of executions based on customer needs and duty cycle – economical, performance hybrids and hybrids with exportable power. Ford is enhancing its strategy for larger trucks and SUVs to better align with customer demand for capability, towing and range, which includes adding extended-range electric options to its lineup.

As part of this plan, Ford’s next-generation F-150 Lightning will shift to an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) architecture and be assembled at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Production of the current generation F-150 Lightning has concluded as Ford redeploys employees to Dearborn Truck Plant to support a third crew for F-150 gas and hybrid truck production as a result of the Novelis fires.

“The F-150 Lightning is a groundbreaking product that demonstrated an electric pickup can still be a great F-Series,” said Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV, digital and design officer. “Our next-generation Lightning EREV is every bit as revolutionary. It keeps everything customers love – 100% electric power delivery, sub-5-second acceleration – and adds an estimated 700+ mile range and tows like a locomotive. It will be an incredibly versatile tool delivered in a capital-efficient way.”

The company no longer intends to produce a previously planned new electric commercial van for Europe but will continue to maintain its full lineup of electrified vans for that market. Ford also plans to replace a planned electric commercial van for North America with a new, affordable commercial van –with gas and hybrid models – to meet the needs of commercial customers. This new van will be manufactured at Ford’s Ohio Assembly Plant.

These moves complement the company’s plan to launch five new affordable vehicles by the end of the decade, four of which will be assembled in the U.S. The company also plans to expand gas, hybrid and extended-range electric options across its portfolio with nearly every vehicle featuring a hybrid or multi-energy powertrain choice by the end of the decade.

Recently, Ford announced a series of changes to its business in Europe, including new leadership to drive the strategic direction, and a European product offensive that will bring a new generation of multi-energy vehicles to customers in Europe. Ford also announced a strategic partnership with Renault to collaborate in the development of electric vehicles in both the commercial and passenger segments.

Expanding Ford’s Truck and Van Leadership with New U.S. Production

This strategy reinforces Ford’s commitment to American manufacturing by repurposing its facilities in Tennessee and Ohio to expand its truck and van lineup leadership.

Tennessee Truck Plant: On the BlueOval City campus, the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center is renamed Tennessee Truck Plant. The facility will produce all-new Built Ford Tough truck models with production starting in 2029. These new affordable gas-powered trucks will broaden Ford’s truck family and extend its market leadership, replacing the previously planned next-generation electric truck.

Ohio Assembly Plant: The plant will become a central hub for Ford Pro, assembling the new gas- and hybrid-powered commercial van starting in 2029, alongside Super Duty chassis cabs, strengthening Ford’s commercial vehicle dominance.

Launching a Battery Energy Storage System Business

Ford is launching a new business – including sales and service – to capture the large demand for battery energy storage from data centers and infrastructure to support the electric grid. Ford plans to repurpose existing U.S. battery manufacturing capacity in Glendale, Kentucky, to serve the rapidly growing battery energy storage systems market. This strategic initiative will leverage currently underutilized electric vehicle battery capacity to create a new, diversified and profitable revenue stream for Ford. The company also plans to invest roughly $2 billion in the next two years to scale the business.

The Kentucky site will be converted to manufacture 5 MWh+ advanced battery energy storage systems. Ford plans to produce LFP prismatic cells, battery energy storage system modules and 20-foot DC container systems at this facility. These systems are at the heart of the energy storage solution market for data centers, utilities, and large-scale industrial and commercial customers.

Leveraging more than a century of manufacturing expertise and licensed advanced battery technology, Ford plans to bring initial capacity online within 18 months, positioning the company to capture share in the growing U.S. battery energy storage systems market. Ford currently plans to deploy at least 20 GWh annually by late 2027.

Last week, Ford, SK On, SK Battery America and BlueOval SK entered into a joint venture disposition agreement. Under this mutual agreement, a Ford subsidiary will independently own and operate the Kentucky battery plants. SK On will fully own and operate the Tennessee battery plant.

Separately, Ford will utilize BlueOval Battery Park Michigan in Marshall, Michigan, to produce smaller Amp-hour cells for use in residential energy storage solutions. This plant remains on track to begin manufacturing LFP prismatic battery cells in 2026 to power Ford’s upcoming midsize electric truck, the first model on the new Universal EV Platform.

Building a Stronger, More Sustainable Future

Today’s actions are consistent with Ford’s goal of becoming carbon neutral across its vehicles, manufacturing facilities and supply chain no later than 2050.

The company will continue its environmental leadership with investments in cleaner manufacturing, sustainable supply chains and breakthrough technologies that reduce emissions across its entire ecosystem.

Updated 2025 Guidance

Company raises 2025 adjusted EBIT guidance to about $7 billion given continued underlying business strength, including cost improvement. Reaffirms adjusted free cash flow guidance range, trending towards the high end of $2 billion to $3 billion.

Ford plans to report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 financial results Tuesday, Feb. 10.

The EPA announced that two local governments in Region 8 were chosen for the funding, totaling more than $8.3 million. Along with Rapid City, the Wasatch Integrated Waste Management District in Utah will receive more than $3.4 million.

EPA officials say the grants are designed to improve post-consumer materials management and strengthen local recycling infrastructure.

“I am proud to announce Region 8’s selectees of the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling grants, emphasizing our commitment to fostering local economic growth,” said EPA Regional Administrator Cyrus Western. “By empowering local governments with the resources they need, we are enhancing recycling infrastructure while creating valuable jobs.”

Rapid City plans to use the funding to launch a new commercial recycling program and upgrade recycling equipment. City officials say the improvements are expected to double recycling rates and improve the quality of materials collected.

U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, praised the selection.

“This will help Rapid City continue to provide quality waste management to its residents and keep South Dakota clean,” Johnson said.

Rapid City is among 17 local governments nationwide selected for SWIFR grants under the political subdivisions program. More than 300 communities applied for a share of $58 million in available funding.

More information about the grant program is available on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s SWIFR website.

MITCHELL, SD (Mitchell Now) — U.S. Rep. and gubernatorial candidate Dusty Johnson on Monday announced a new education platform called “Strong Schools,” outlining policies aimed at strengthening South Dakota’s education system and improving student outcomes.

Johnson made the announcement in Sioux Falls, emphasizing education as a key factor in workforce development and long-term economic growth.

“While others are tearing our schools down, I will work to lift students up,” Johnson said. “My focus is on our future, and education remains our number one tool for upward mobility and achieving the American Dream.”

The plan includes three main components. Johnson says he would restore K-12 education as South Dakota’s largest budget priority, reversing a recommendation in Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposed budget that would make education no longer the state’s top spending category.

Johnson also proposes a collaborative effort with educators and families to improve reading and math achievement, particularly at the elementary and middle school levels, with a renewed focus on foundational skills.

The third element would create a skilled trade pathway to graduation, allowing certain technical and trade courses to count as equivalents for upper-level math and science requirements. Johnson says the change would recognize the applied math and science skills required in many trade professions.

“Now is not the time to defund our schools—it is time to defend our students,” Johnson said.

More recently, the Secretary of Energy directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate rulemaking procedures under 42 U.S.C.
New agency procedures and the focus on streamlined NEPA reviews for energy development projects should result in opportunities for power generation infrastructure to complete NEPA reviews that are limited in scope and completed efficiently.
Project applicants can play a key role in the process by, for example, funding NEPA reviews through the OBBBA provision and/or preparing NEPA documents for agency review.
To the extent such NEPA reviews are challenged, the agencies’ analysis will be given substantial deference under Seven County.","In the push for more efficient and streamlined permitting processes, recent changes from Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the executive branch have reshaped the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) landscape. These changes are particularly important against the backdrop of the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers, which is driving significant increased energy demand. This article provides an overview of the new NEPA landscape and implications for the permitting of energy infrastructure needed to power the AI boom.

Congress enacted significant bipartisan changes to NEPA in amendments from the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in 2025. These amendments streamlined the NEPA review process.

The FRA encouraged more efficient NEPA reviews by, among other things, defining “major Federal action,” clarifying that the scope of NEPA review is focused on “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects,” and establishing page limits and deadlines for environmental impact statements (EIS) and environmental assessments (EA). The OBBBA further amended NEPA by creating a framework that allows developers to opt in to expedited NEPA review if they pay 125 percent of the anticipated costs to prepare or supervise an EA or EIS. Once a developer pays this fee, the OBBBA directs relevant agencies to complete an EA or EIS in 180 days or one year, respectively.

Supreme Court Issues ‘Course Correction’ for NEPA Reviews

The U.S. Supreme Court on May 29, 2025, issued Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, which constituted a self-proclaimed “course correction” for NEPA jurisprudence. The Court recognized that lower courts have been aggressive in policing agency compliance with NEPA, thereby creating unpredictable judicial review. As a result, even though NEPA is procedural in nature, many critical infrastructure projects have been slowed or abandoned due to ever-increasing review timeframes and the threat of litigation from project opponents. The Court determined that, in approving the construction of a new railroad transporting crude oil, the Surface Transportation Board was not required to consider effects from increased oil drilling upstream or increased oil refining downstream because those impacts were from separate actions over which it did not exercise regulatory authority. The Court held that 1) NEPA requires courts to afford agencies “substantial deference,” and 2) NEPA does not require agencies to analyze “effects from potential future projects or from geographically separate projects.”

This case reinforced longstanding Supreme Court holdings on the limited scope of NEPA reviews and is likely to improve the NEPA process by providing support for agencies to focus their reviews on impacts associated with their authorizations.

In February 2025, following a landmark D.C. Circuit decision holding that CEQ lacks authority to promulgate binding regulations (Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration), and President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14154, Unleashing American Energy, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) published an interim final rule rescinding its regulations implementing NEPA. In corresponding guidance, CEQ directed agencies to revise their regulations to expedite permitting approvals and for consistency with the 2023 NEPA Amendments. On September 29, 2025, CEQ issued revised guidance, which included a template for agencies to use to ensure consistency with recent statutory changes, Seven County, and CEQ directives to streamline and improve permitting.

The Trump administration is focused on streamlining the permitting process, particularly for fossil fuel generation and infrastructure that supports energy dominance goals and data center expansion. Consistent with these goals and CEQ’s directives, the Department of Energy (DOE), Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), and the Department of Interior (DOI), among other agencies, have revised their NEPA procedures to include streamlined processes (e.g., EA and EIS deadlines, fewer public comment requirements, expanded categorical exclusions, allowance for applicant-prepared documents) and clarifications on the limited scope of NEPA reviews (e.g., application of Seven County standard for effects to be considered in a NEPA review, examples of actions that are not “major federal actions” requiring NEPA reviews).

Prioritizing Energy Generation and Delivery in the AI Boom

Load demand is projected to increase precipitously in the coming years, with one study projecting a 35% to 50% increase between 2024 and 2040. The causes of increased load demand are many, but in the near term one stands above the rest—the rapid rise of AI and corresponding buildout of data centers. A recent DOE study estimates that data center load growth has tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028. The demand for electricity from AI data centers is driving investments in new power generation, grid upgrades, and sustainable energy sources. The realization that more capacity is needed, and quickly, has prompted government and industry action.

Increasing the nation’s generation capacity has been a central priority for the Trump administration. On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump signed two EOs—Unleashing American Energy and Declaring a National Energy Emergency—that recognize a robust generation profile as critical for America’s economy and national security. Pursuant to those EOs, several federal agencies enacted “emergency procedures” to expedite their permitting timelines for energy-related projects under statutes including NEPA, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act. Based on the Administration’s directives, agencies are prioritizing permitting for projects that support energy (particularly fossil fuel) development.

In July 2025, President Trump issued a series of AI-related EOs and an AI Action Plan. The EO titled Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure calls for accelerated permitting for projects such as natural gas turbines, coal power equipment, nuclear power equipment, geothermal power equipment, and “any other dispatchable baseload energy resources, including electrical infrastructure (including backup power supply)” serving a data center project. The EO directs CEQ and relevant agencies to identify or establish categorical exclusions that could facilitate the construction of qualifying data center projects without preparing an EIS or EA. The EO also authorizes the designation of qualifying projects as “transparency projects” for the purpose of listing on the FAST-41 permitting dashboard and directs the Corps to develop a Clean Water Act section 404 nationwide permit to facilitate efficient permitting for data centers and associated infrastructure. More recently, the Secretary of Energy directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate rulemaking procedures under 42 U.S.C. § 7173 to expedite and facilitate the interconnection of “large loads” (e.g., data centers) to the interstate transmission system.

Power Generation and Data Center Projects Can Benefit from Streamlined Permitting in the New NEPA Landscape

Whether and how NEPA applies to power plant and data center permitting turns on the federal authorizations and/or financing that is required for the project. NEPA is required for “major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”

“Major Federal actions” are those that are “subject to substantial Federal control and responsibility.”Federal involvement can take many forms, such as authorization from the Bureau of Land Management or National Park Service for projects on or crossing public lands or parks, permits from the Corps for the fill of “waters of the United States,” or DOE grants or loan guarantees.

Depending on the federal agency action required for the project, the agency will determine the appropriate level of NEPA review (if any) and prepare a NEPA analysis in the form of a categorical exclusion determination, EA, or EIS. New agency procedures and the focus on streamlined NEPA reviews for energy development projects should result in opportunities for power generation infrastructure to complete NEPA reviews that are limited in scope and completed efficiently. Project applicants can play a key role in the process by, for example, funding NEPA reviews through the OBBBA provision and/or preparing NEPA documents for agency review. To the extent such NEPA reviews are challenged, the agencies’ analysis will be given substantial deference under Seven County.

In sum, the changes in NEPA and focus on permitting reforms should provide opportunities in the coming years for more streamlined NEPA reviews that facilitate the development of energy infrastructure and the data center buildout.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/hitachi-hvdc-stock-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 17:02:06.027038

China speed leaves competitors in the dust Foreign automakers fell behind because of dramatic changes in the Chinese market over the past five years.
Other foreign automakers have reacted in different ways.
The approach reflects a growing recognition among foreign automakers that they can learn from China, and not just vice versa.","HEFEI, China (AP) — Volkswagen is making a major bet in China, the largest and one of the most cutthroat auto markets in the world. The question is whether it will work.

The German carmaker, which once dominated the market with a more than 50% share, has invested 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in a sprawling research and development center — its largest outside its home country — in Hefei, a low-key central China city of 10 million people.

It's a sea change from how foreign automakers operated in China for decades by making cars they developed overseas, sharing their technology with local partners. That strategy has been shoved aside by fast-rising local competitors who have sharply cut into the sales of foreign brands.

""This business model is now gone,"" Thomas Ulbrich, the chief technology officer of the Volkswagen Group in China said.

The Chinese consumer is king

In what Ulbrich calls a paradigm shift, Volkswagen started its latest overhaul of its approach to China in 2022.

It is developing vehicles specifically tailored to Chinese drivers — cars that will likely never be seen on European roads, though they may make their way to markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

As the new models roll out, Volkswagen will find out if the investment will pay off by helping it to catch up with the likes of Chinese makers BYD and Geely and win back market share.

Such a strategy is key to regaining competitiveness within China, said Rella Suskin, an equity analyst at Morningstar covering the European automotive sector.

But, she predicted, ""it will enable them to maintain market share levels in line with current levels, rather than allow them to regain the market share that has been lost over the last few years.""

The question is whether it can make money in a hypercompetitive market that has driven prices down to bankrupting levels.

Audi, part of the Volkswagen Group, led the way with this year's introduction of a new brand dubbed ""AUDI"" — its name in capital letters. VW is gearing up to launch new 2026 models developed ""in China, for China,"" as the carmaker likes to say.

""It's a million-dollar question whether this strategy will pay off,"" said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings. ""We have to monitor, but I think they are on the right track of catching up in the race.""

China speed leaves competitors in the dust

Foreign automakers fell behind because of dramatic changes in the Chinese market over the past five years.

Electric vehicles have shot up to about half of new car sales. And buyers expect them to come with the latest digital features, from big iPad-like touch screens to autonomous driving capabilities such as effortless backing into a parking space.

Volkswagens were no longer the right fit in a major market that accounts for about one-third of its global sales, 40 years after it began making sedans in Shanghai with its state-owned local partner, SAIC. For years, basic VW Santana and Jetta sedans were a mainstay of taxi fleets, and the first cars purchased by many city dwellers.

Now, it needs to revamp it's line-up at what has become known as ""China speed."" In a market as competitive as China's, survival depends on pushing out new models and features quickly, said Bill Russo, the CEO of Automobility, a Shanghai-based consultancy.

Chinese EV makers bring new cars to market in 12 to 18 months, versus three to five years for global automakers. ""The pace is not a choice but a necessity — and that pressure fuels global competitiveness,"" Russo said.

China emerges as a source of innovation

In the mid-1990s, Ulbrich worked in northeastern China, where VW made sedans with another state company, FAW, or First Auto Works, importing everything from seats to wheel rims. The parts weren't available locally.

Thirty years later, nearly everything is made in China. And now it's being designed here. To speed up product development, Volkswagen headquarters has given decision-making power to the local operation.

Other foreign automakers have reacted in different ways. Some have reduced their operations or even pulled out. Japan's Toyota, like Volkswagen, has transferred authority to its China team to accelerate decision-making, giving them ""unprecedented autonomy in product planning and development,"" Yuan said.

Volkswagen is looking to pick up know-how from China's EV startups. It has teamed up with electric vehicle maker Xpeng to bring new models to market more quickly and develop its own electronic architecture — essentially the internal computer system that runs all a car's functions.

The approach reflects a growing recognition among foreign automakers that they can learn from China, and not just vice versa. For many, the key is how quickly Chinese firms can turn an idea into a product, slashing development costs and delivering what customers want in a timely way.

""Knowledge flows are a two-way street between China and Germany,"" said Martin Hofmann, a Volkswagen executive who is the chair of the German Chamber of Commerce in North China.

In a recent survey of the chamber's membership, about half of the more than 600 responding companies said they expect Chinese competitors to become innovation leaders in the next five years — and 9% said they already are.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/vw.oQTda25IOg.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.48&fp-y=0.68&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-12-15 20:59:29.750756

Blue Marlin could cause communities to lose tax revenue that could be used to support public services, if they apply for tax abatements.
The harm from the production of crude oil to be exported by the Blue Marlin terminal is estimated at a social cost between roughly $998 million to $2.37 billion.
“This report adds to growing evidence that oil export projects do more harm than good,” said Allison Woolverton, report author and campaign manager at Earthworks.
Despite the Trump administration’s best efforts to boost fossil fuels, other oil export projects are facing challenges in securing buyers and becoming financially viable.","PORT ARTHUR, Texas — A report published today by Port Arthur Community Action Network (PACAN) and Earthworks finds that Jefferson County, Orange County, and Cameron Parish would receive little economic benefit from the Blue Marlin Offshore Port, a proposed offshore oil export project. The report comes as the Maritime Administration completes the final environmental impact statement for the project, which will initiate a public comment period.

The report, “Would the Blue Marlin Offshore Port Deliver on the Local Benefits it Promises?”, reviewed the Maritime Administration and U.S. Coast Guard’s draft environmental impact statement of the project and other sources and found:

The project would only create 39 jobs over the project’s 25-year period, with no guarantee to hire these workers from local communities.

The potential for oil leaks and spills from the project could result in economic damages to the communities.

Blue Marlin could cause communities to lose tax revenue that could be used to support public services, if they apply for tax abatements.

The harm from the production of crude oil to be exported by the Blue Marlin terminal is estimated at a social cost between roughly $998 million to $2.37 billion. The end use, or combustion, of this exported crude oil would incur a social cost ranging from $11 billion to $37.5 billion.

“Why would you support a project when there’s no direct benefit you’re going to see from it?” said John Beard Jr., Port Arthur resident, founder and CEO of PACAN. “This project has received endorsements, yet projects like these are why people in our communities are being displaced.”

Blue Marlin would construct a 42-inch crude oil pipeline under the Neches River, around Bessie Heights Marsh and under the center of Sabine Lake. The pipeline would connect to the existing Stingray Pipeline in Johnson Bayou, Louisiana, and run into the Gulf of Mexico, where an offshore port capable of filling up supertankers would be built.

“This report adds to growing evidence that oil export projects do more harm than good,” said Allison Woolverton, report author and campaign manager at Earthworks. “Communities shouldn’t have to keep risking their health and their homes just so billionaires can make more money.”

Blue Marlin is one of four offshore oil and gas export terminals proposed off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Despite the Trump administration’s best efforts to boost fossil fuels, other oil export projects are facing challenges in securing buyers and becoming financially viable. United States production of oil and gas is already at a record high, and global demand for fossil fuels is expected to peak in the next five years.

As program director at Sidewalk Detroit, Morrison employs a grassroots and emergent strategy approach to foster meaningful connections between artists and communities. Their background in arts and humanities and arts education from Michigan State University has led them to work at the Broad Art Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, Detroit Institute of Arts and Cranbrook Art Museum. At Sidewalk Detroit they lead efforts to organize community and artist-specific engagements and support curatorial work, influencing the organization’s artistic direction. Morrison is deeply committed to Detroit’s arts and culture community, promoting whole-hearted inclusivity in public and green spaces. Beyond their local endeavors, they tour nationally as a violinist.

Sidewalk Detroit has become known for transforming public spaces through arts and community-centered design. How would you describe the organization’s mission to business leaders who may be discovering your work for the first time?

We center our work around three key areas: public art, equitable green space and city-building.

The thread that runs through all of it is deep engagement with residents, rooted in design and artmaking as tools for democracy, community power and self-actualization for marginalized and racialized people.

Our mission is to inspire community members to reclaim their space through meaningful engagement. Our goal is to create fair, joyful spaces through public art, cultural programming and collaborative community partnerships. Reclaiming and reactivating public space is a radical act of resilience.

We work with city planners and community members to shape their neighborhoods, ensuring their voices are not only heard but drive change. We also commission original large-scale permanent artworks such as sculptures and murals—with a focus on environmental sustainability—and curate experiences that uplift cultural expression, environmental justice and equitable development.

As an award-winning firm, we have spent 12 years working across numerous neighborhoods, cities and states. We are continually rehired and recommended for new projects, and we’re honored to be held in high esteem by our community, colleagues and collaborators.

We are nationally recognized for our flagship program, Sidewalk Festival, a biannual outdoor performing arts festival.

Many of your projects are rooted in deep engagement with residents and local partners. What does your approach to community engagement look like and how does it contribute to stronger long-term investment in neighborhoods?

We elevate community voices by empowering residents and artists to be in the room when decisions are being made. We train community leaders, planners, developers, private stakeholders, and artists around the principles of emergent strategies and spatial equity. For example, we often say, go one mile deep and one inch wide. We listen deeply to the people we are working with and build trust along the way by working side by side with community members.

We plan and facilitate community engagement events and activities, and we organize and analyze one-on-one interviews and feedback sessions as part of our approach to building trust in the neighborhoods we serve.

Our award-winning engagement approach within the Joe Louis Greenway Neighborhood Framework Plan demonstrates how we’ve equipped community members and local leaders with the tools to confidently show up and speak up. By forming a Community Leadership Team, we ensured residents could center their voices and culture in shaping how planners and other decision-makers perceive and invest in their community.

We worked with the planning team in 2016 and again in 2025 for the second phase of the Joe Louis Greenway plan.

Sidewalk Detroit operates at the intersection of arts, placemaking and economic revitalization. How do you see these areas working together to support healthier and more resilient local economies?

Sidewalk Detroit operates at the intersection of the arts, placemaking and economic revitalization by using creative practice and community-centered design as drivers of healthier, more resilient local economies. We see these areas as mutually reinforcing: the arts catalyze public imagination and social connection; placemaking builds the physical and cultural infrastructure for community belonging; and economic revitalization becomes possible when residents have equitable access to vibrant, resilient and well-stewarded public spaces.

Our work uplifting, activating and advocating for equitable access to urban green spaces exemplifies this intersection. As the stewards, programmers and advocates for Eliza Howell Park—Detroit’s fourth-largest park—we focus on supporting the Brightmoor neighborhood, a community that has experienced historic disinvestment. Through arts-infused programming, strengthened stewardship practices and advocacy for long-term green space investment, we help transform the park into a community anchor that supports environmental resilience, public health and local pride.

Because many residents live within the floodplain of the Rouge River, we also see climate resilience as central to economic resilience. Our education and engagement efforts equip residents with knowledge about climate impacts while inviting them into deeper connection with the land and the ecological importance of Eliza Howell Park, an essential habitat in Southeast Michigan and a site of cultural, ecological and Indigenous significance.

These efforts extend into our broader city-building work, where we collaborate with planners, developers and designers to embed community voice and equitable access into transformative land-use and green space projects across Detroit and the greater Rust Belt. Through projects such as the Joe Louis Greenway, the Hill District Park Plan in Pittsburgh, the Grand Rapids Community Master Plan, Detroit’s Art Alley Program and the City of Detroit’s Vibrant Blocks for Business, we work to disrupt conventional narratives about what public space can be and ensure investments reflect community aspirations.

Our emerging training in spatial trauma-informed planning further strengthens this work by equipping city builders with empathy-driven, justice-centered approaches—an essential step toward economic systems that are truly inclusive and sustainable.

Together, these strategies show how the arts, placemaking and economic revitalization can operate in tandem. By centering racialized and marginalized communities, particularly Black neighborhoods in Detroit, we help cultivate environments where creativity, ecological stewardship and economic opportunity reinforce one another. In our view, resilient local economies are built from the ground up through connected communities, equitable public spaces and imaginative, future-informed approaches to city-building.

Although your organization is based in Detroit, your team increasingly consults with communities and institutions across the country. What types of advisory or consulting services do you provide for clients outside the region?

Our engagement strategies are tailored to each project and rooted in advancing equity and inclusion through a research-justice approach. We begin by building relationships with community members through one-on-one conversations. Our engagement approach follows these best practices:

Equity and inclusion: Focusing on marginalized populations and repairing historical engagement and development harms.

Community-driven research: Led and shaped by residents through a Community Leadership Team.

Non-extractive data collection: Prioritizing knowledge sharing and elevating qualitative, experiential data alongside quantitative, hard data.

Our city-building work closely intersects with our green equity goals. We frequently serve as engagement leads, facilitators and outreach specialists on transformative land-use and green space projects across Michigan and, more recently, the greater Rust Belt. We collaborate with city planners, developers, engineers and architects to bring community vision to neighborhood framework plans, land-use projects, parks, greenways and public amenities. Each year, we selectively join design teams working on major planning projects with the goal of disrupting conventional narratives about public space possibilities.

From an economic development perspective, what are some of the biggest opportunities you see for cities that invest in creative placemaking and public space innovation?

Investing in creative placemaking and public space innovation drives economic growth that is resilient, equitable and lasting. When public spaces are activated through art, culture and community-centered design, they become hubs for connection, small business growth and long-term neighborhood vitality.

One of the biggest opportunities is the ability to retain and attract people. Vibrant, culturally rich public spaces make neighborhoods more desirable to live, work and gather in. When residents feel pride and belonging in their surroundings, they stay, invest locally and help shape the future of their community.

Creative placemaking also strengthens local economic ecosystems. Public art installations, festivals and cultural programs draw foot traffic that benefits small businesses, entrepreneurs and local vendors. They also create opportunities for artists, fabricators and creative workers, groups often overlooked in traditional economic development planning.

Another key opportunity is community-driven problem-solving. Engaging residents as co-designers of public space taps into the knowledge and creativity of people who know the neighborhood best. This produces solutions that are context-specific, sustainable and widely supported. When communities feel ownership over public assets, maintenance costs decrease and long-term stewardship increases.

Investing in public space innovation also allows cities to align economic growth with environmental resilience. Projects that integrate green infrastructure, climate education and environmental art—like many of Sidewalk Detroit’s initiatives—create spaces that support health, safety and ecological well-being while stimulating economic activity.

Cities that prioritize creative placemaking are investing in people, not just property. They are building the social infrastructure that strengthens local economies from the ground up: cultural identity, neighborhood pride, cross-sector collaboration and a shared vision for the future. These investments lead to more inclusive development outcomes and ensure economic growth benefits communities long overlooked or displaced by traditional development models.

At Sidewalk Detroit, creative placemaking isn’t just a strategy, it’s an essential pathway to equitable, joyful and sustainable economic development.

Sidewalk Detroit often collaborates with public agencies, philanthropic partners and private sector teams. What do successful cross sector partnerships look like and what lessons have you learned about building them?

While our work is somewhat unique—bringing together artists, activists and organizers to address process, policy and community voice in planning—we strive to learn from like-minded organizations and build strategic collaborations with other change-makers and creatives. We have found that successful partnerships thrive when they are long-term. Working across sectors and drawing on a diverse network of ideas, values and people allows us and our partners to grow capacity.

Sustainable relationships enable the sharing and saving of resources, time and energy. We are stronger together, and we have learned that meaningful partnerships require ongoing care, reciprocity and trust.

Many organizations are focused on creating more inclusive and equitable processes but struggle with implementation. How does Sidewalk Detroit help clients design frameworks that truly include residents and stakeholders in planning and decision making?

At Sidewalk Detroit, we help clients bridge that gap by grounding every engagement plan in spatial equity and trauma-informed facilitation—two core values that shape how we design, listen and lead.

Spatial equity ensures that communities historically excluded from planning conversations are prioritized, not sidelined. We work with clients to center these residents from the beginning, making sure engagement is accessible, culturally meaningful and aligned with the lived realities of the people most impacted by development decisions.

Our trauma-informed approach acknowledges the long histories of disinvestment, displacement, and environmental harm many neighborhoods carry. We train clients to understand how these histories shape trust, participation, and emotional safety. This leads to engagement processes that are slower, deeper and more respectful—built around care, transparency and consent rather than transactional outreach.

In practice, this means we help clients:

Create engagement strategies that center accessibility and resident input

Build feedback loops so community input shapes decisions

Structure meetings and workshops that are joyful, healing, accessible and rooted in placekeeping

Identify barriers that keep residents from participating and remove them

Foster true community ownership of projects

Our goal is to help organizations shift from inviting residents to the table to sharing the table with them and, when needed, rebuilding the table entirely. By embedding spatial equity and trauma-informed facilitation into every step, we create frameworks that honor community expertise and lead to more just, resilient and community-driven outcomes.

Looking ahead, what trends in urban development, culture and community engagement are most shaping your work and how is Sidewalk Detroit preparing for the next chapter of growth both locally and nationally?

Interest in spatial equity and community-led development is growing. In Detroit, we are expanding our spatial trauma training beyond current planning partners, offering it as a resource for artists, planners, developers and anyone invested in equitable city-building.

We’re strengthening our community engagement practice by hosting meetups on best practices, shared challenges and capacity building in the field. Spatial equity remains central to everything we do. By helping practitioners ground their work in equity and center historically disinvested communities, we ensure access to safe, joyful, culturally meaningful and environmentally healthy public spaces. This is how we prepare for growth—by investing in the people and principles that build resilient, community-driven cities.

“We must be able to scrutinize DTE’s ability to sell this massive amount of electricity without negatively impacting residents.
Despite the environmental risks, Whitmer celebrated the data center when it was announced on Oct. 30, saying it will create jobs.","State regulators are facing increasing pressure to slow down a $7 billion, 2.2-million-square-foot data center proposed for rural Saline Township, where residents and environmental groups warn the project would destroy wetlands, strain Michigan’s energy grid, and permanently reshape a farming community that opposes the development.

The project, dubbed “Project Stargate,” is backed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, OpenAI, Oracle, and developer Related Digital. If completed, it would be one of the largest data centers in the country and require as much electricity as nearly one million homes to power artificial intelligence and cloud-computing.

Supporters say the facility would bring investment and tax revenue, but critics argue the public still has not received clear explanations about its environmental toll and long-term costs.

Those concerns deepened this week as residents and environmental groups flagged major problems in the developer’s wetlands permit application to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). The filings, which cover culvert installations, stormwater outfalls, and the destruction of more than 10 acres of wetlands, contain incorrect information, vague mitigation plans, and incomplete site details, according to environmental advocates. The permit would also “temporarily impact” a stretch of a tributary of the Saline River and allow discharges from cooling systems that could contain glycol, raising fears about contamination of local waterways and habitat loss for threatened species such as the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake, Indiana bat, and Mitchell’s Satyr butterfly, according to the Economic Development Responsibility Alliance of Michigan, a nonpartisan group focused on protecting land, water, and taxpayer rights.

Residents say the developer is downplaying the environmental risks. They point to a federal “red flag” from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over impacts to protected wetlands and note that Related Digital’s proposal to purchase mitigation bank credits would not replace any of the wetlands destroyed on-site.

Local resident Tim Bruneau said that “allowing the data center to proceed is a self-imposed environmental catastrophe,” expressing concerns that the developer’s promises are false and unenforceable.

“Related Digital paints a rosy picture of mitigation, but the reality is far more disruptive,” Bruneau said. “They want to dewater and eviscerate a sensitive ecosystem.

The scrutiny comes as the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) prepares to meet Thursday for a decision on whether DTE Energy can fast-track special power contracts needed to serve the 1.4-gigawatt facility. The timeline has drawn strong criticism. More than 5,000 public comments have been submitted to the commission, with the vast majority opposed, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is urging the MPSC to treat the case as a contested proceeding, which is a lengthier process that would allow discovery, expert testimony, and public scrutiny of the deal.

“DTE continues to push for a rubber-stamp approval of a secret deal, but time and again, my office has contested their filings — and time after time, the utility has shown it is not a trustworthy partner, routinely filling cases with unjustified costs,” Nessel said in a statement earlier this month. “We must be able to scrutinize DTE’s ability to sell this massive amount of electricity without negatively impacting residents. No matter how DTE tries to explain it away, this case — involving hundreds of millions of dollars in costs just to connect the data center to DTE’s power grid — should be treated as contested like any other, and their customers have made it overwhelmingly clear that they too want full public hearings.”

Large portions of DTE’s proposed contracts are redacted, and regulators have yet to see full details about how the utility would serve the data center without raising rates for everyone else.

Despite the environmental risks, Whitmer celebrated the data center when it was announced on Oct. 30, saying it will create jobs.

“This transformational new Stargate OpenAI facility, built by Oracle and Related Digital, will create 2,500 good-paying union construction jobs, more than 450 permanent high-skill, high-paying jobs on site, and 1,500 more in the community while helping us lead the future of advanced manufacturing and technology,” Whitmer said at the time. “I’m grateful to these cutting-edge companies for betting on Michigan, building on our work to compete for and win big projects in next-generation industries from cars and clean energy to semiconductors and batteries.”

The rush is driven by the AI boom, which has prompted a nationwide surge in energy-eating data centers. Training and running advanced AI models requires enormous computing power, and tech companies are rushing to secure land, water, and electricity infrastructure.

Michigan has become a target for developers because of its comparatively low land costs and access to transmission lines, but each new project raises concerns about energy reliability, long-term costs, and environmental impacts.

Preliminary work has already begun at the site, but most construction will require building permits.

Kathryn Haushalter, whose farmhouse borders the proposed data center location off West Michigan Avenue, recently filed a motion in Washtenaw County Circuit Court to intervene in the case and overturn a consent judgment that allowed the project to proceed after the township initially denied rezoning. She alleges township officials violated the Open Meetings Act by privately voting to settle a lawsuit brought by Related Digital and landowners and by signing the consent judgment without a public vote.

Preliminary construction work has already caused frustrations as residents point to semitrailers on rural backroads, noise from backup alarms, and safety issues on Michigan Avenue, despite a court-ordered requirement that heavy equipment avoid unpaved roads.

The wetlands review by EGLE, which is scheduled for the same day as the MPSC meeting, is expected to draw a lot of attention. Environmental groups say the stakes are high because wetlands play a crucial role in flood control, water quality, and regional climate regulation. They argue the law requires developers to prove there are no feasible alternative sites and that the project serves the public interest.

Beth Foley, a regenerative farmer who lives two miles from the site, is concerned about long-term impacts.

“We operate our farm with the guiding mantra of a Native American proverb, ‘We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children,’” Foley said. “This project will have lasting impacts for generations to come. How can we possibly ask the next generation to clean up this mess?”

Since ozone depleting substances were phased out of the economy beginning in the 1990s, HFCs have been the most commonly used refrigerant in air conditioning and refrigeration appliances. Now EPA is phasing these refrigerants down based on their global warming potential (GWP).

Beginning on January 1, 2026, EPA’s HFC Leak Repair and Management Rule (HFC Management Rule) comes into effect, placing mandatory leak detection and repair requirements on owners or operators of HFC-containing appliances that have a refrigerant charge of 15 pounds or greater.

Additionally, on October 3, 2025, EPA published its proposed reconsideration of the Technology Transitions Rule which restricts the GWP of refrigerants used in new air conditioning and refrigeration systems. The comment period on EPA’s reconsideration proposal for the Technology Transitions Rule closed on November 21, 2025. If finalized, EPA’s proposal would provide regulatory relief to members in the retail food industry, industrial chillers and refrigeration systems in semiconductor manufacturing sector, and cold storage warehouses.

The HFC Management Rule and Technology Transitions Rule are two of three regulatory programs promulgated by EPA under the authority of the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020. These regulatory programs seek to restrict and phase down the use of HFC-refrigerants in the U.S. based on their GWP and, ultimately, replace HFC-appliances and systems with new alternative technologies. This article provides an overview of the AIM Act, the regulatory programs created by EPA to fulfill the AIM Act, and EPA’s HFC regulatory programs, along with a status update of the HFC regulatory programs.

The AIM Act: Hydrofluorocarbon Regulations and the Current Legal Landscape

The American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020 passed through Congress with wide bipartisan support, touting domestic manufacturing and job creation while simultaneously aligning with international commitments under the Kigali Protocol. Focused on addressing the global warming potential (GWP) of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) commonly used in refrigerants, the AIM Act directs EPA to promulgate regulations to phase down HFCs to 15 percent of their historic baseline levels by 2036, restrict the usage of HFCs in industry sectors or subsectors, and establish requirements for the management, service, repair, disposal, and installation of equipment utilizing HFCs.

In response, EPA has established the HFC Allowance Allocation Program, the Technology Transitions Rule, and the HFC Management Rule. Collectively, these regulations seek to reduce HFCs from the U.S. economy at a rapid pace and at a great cost to the industries that utilize and rely on refrigerants. These rules have a major impact on facilities that rely on large heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) systems and refrigeration systems. They place significant and disproportionate burdens on the grocery industry and other retailers of food products, as well as producers and suppliers of refrigerant gases, resulting in increases in the cost of doing business and, in turn, increases in costs to consumers to offset the increased regulatory expenses.

HFC Allowance Allocation Rule

As of January 1, 2022, the HFC Allowance Allocation Program created a consumption and production allowance expenditure program for HFCs with the goal of phasing down HFCs to 15 percent of their historic baseline level by 2036. Under the program, no person may produce or import bulk HFCs or bulk refrigerant blends containing HFCs unless that person expends production and/or consumption allowances in a quantity equal to the exchange value-weighted equivalent of the HFCs produced or imported.

Thus, in order to produce HFCs in the U.S. after January 1, 2022, an entity must possess both production and consumption allowances and expend the allowances at the time the HFCs are produced. Likewise, a bulk HFC importer must both possess and expend consumption allowances at the time the bulk HFCs enter U.S. jurisdiction. Production and consumption allowances must be expended in the year for which they were issued. Every kilogram of a produced or imported HFC in excess of the allowances expended constitutes a separate violation of the rules.

EPA allocates production and consumption allowances to eligible entities by October 1 of the year prior to the year in which the allowances can be used. In order to be eligible for production and/or consumption allowances, an entity must have produced or imported bulk HFCs in years 2021 and/or 2022. To calculate an entity’s consumption allowance allocation, EPA utilizes the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted production and/or consumption amounts that the eligible entity reported to EPA for calendar years 2011 through 2019. Currently, EPA is not offering production and consumption allowances to new market entrants. It provided a “one-time” opportunity in 2024 for eligible entities that had not previously applied for allowances to do so. The total consumption allowances available by year are as follows:

2026-2028: 181,522,990 MTEVe

2029-2033: 90,761,495 MTEVe

2034-2035: 60,507,663 MTEVe

2036 and thereafter: 45,380,747 MTEVe

The HFC Allowance Allocation Rule offers an exception to the consumption allowance expenditure requirement for bulk HFCs that are transshipped through the U.S. and leaving U.S. jurisdiction within six months. However, to qualify for this exception, there are strict notification requirements that must be met, including notifying EPA at least 30 days prior to the import leaving its foreign port of export and within 10 days from when the bulk HFCs are exported out of the U.S. Additionally, the HFC Allowance Allocation Rule has specific and extensive reporting and recordkeeping requirements that participating entities must comply with, and the rule requires a third-party audit of its recordkeeping and reporting to be conducted by a certified public accountant.

Under the Biden Administration, EPA prioritized enforcement against entities producing or importing HFCs without expending the necessary production or consumption allowances. In its March 12, 2025 memorandum, EPA’s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance states that enforcement “regarding hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) shall focus on the unlawful import and subsequent sale of HFCs.” Thus, enforcement of this program will continue with a likely focus on the import of bulk HFCs without expending consumption allowances.

Technology Transitions Rule

Beginning January 1, 2025, the Technology Transitions Rule restricts the manufacture, sale, distribution, import, and export of appliances containing HFCs in certain residential, commercial, and industrial sectors beyond specified dates and based on a GWP limit established for each sector. The rule divides industries by subcategories and applies a specific low GWP limit – 150 or 300 GWP for most refrigeration systems and 700 GWP for most HVAC systems – on the entire industry subcategory.

While the goal of the Technology Transitions Rule is to encourage and incentivize technological advancement in HFC-alternative refrigerant systems, the rule is based on a series of assumptions that have proven to be false. First, there is a lack of available, EPA-approved alternative refrigerants on the market, thus driving up the costs of the “new” refrigerants. Second, many of the alternative refrigerants pose safety risks due to flammability or toxicity concerns, and the vast majority of US building codes do not currently allow for their use or installation. Third, the alternative systems are severely inefficient, uneconomical, or technologically infeasible for their proposed usage. Accordingly, industry initiated litigation to challenge the Technology Transitions Rule that is pending in the D.C. Circuit.

On March 12, 2025, EPA announced reconsideration of the Technology Transitions Rule as one of its 31 deregulation priorities and released its reconsideration proposal on October 3, 2025. Under its reconsideration proposal, EPA is proposing to adjust the GWP threshold for remote condensing units and supermarket systems from 150 or 300 (depending on the charge size and type of system) to 1,400 starting on January 1, 2026. The GWP thresholds for these systems will later adjust back to the original proposed of GWP limit of 150 or 300 beginning on January 1, 2032. EPA is also proposing to delay the compliance for certain industrial chillers and refrigeration systems in the semiconductor manufacturing sector from January 1, 2026 and January 1, 2028, to January 1, 2030.

HFC Management Rule

Beginning January 1, 2026, the HFC Management Rule imposes burdensome leak detection and repair requirements on existing refrigeration or HVAC systems that mandate the retrofitting and retirement of existing equipment in certain scenarios. The rule requires a leak rate calculation to be performed every time refrigerant is added to the system, and, if the leak rate is above a certain threshold, a complicated leak repair process is triggered which may compel the retrofitting or retirement of the system if the repair is not made within 30 days.

This leak detection process will be required on any refrigeration-containing appliances with a full charge of 15 or more pounds of HFC refrigerants or substitutes with a GWP greater than 53. The low applicability threshold greatly expands the scope of the rule beyond similar leak detection and repair requirements for refrigeration systems containing ozone depleting substances, which applies only to systems with a full charge of 50 pounds or more. Thus, for the first time, appliances containing 15-49 pounds of HFC refrigerants would be subject to leak detection and repair requirements.

If system owners are unable to make a verified repair within 30 days of exceeding an applicable leak rate threshold, they are required to develop a retrofit or retirement plan and must fulfill the retrofitting or retirement of the system within one year. Thus, the HFC Management Plan provides very little time to repair a system before a system owner must begin to plan and implement the complete overhaul, retirement, and/or replacement of their system.

The HFC Management Rule also requires installation of automatic leak detection systems on new and existing refrigerant-containing appliances in the industrial process and commercial refrigeration subsectors with a charge size of 1,500 pounds or more. The automatic leak detection systems must be installed by January 1, 2026, for new systems and by January 1, 2027, for existing systems. And, while the rule places burdensome restrictions and requirements on the process of reclaiming and recycling HFCs, the servicing and repair of refrigerant-containing appliances in the supermarket systems, refrigerated transport, and automatic commercial ice maker subsectors must be done with reclaimed HFCs after January 1, 2029.",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1765836403/201401.png,N,,2025-12-15 19:01:21.625735

Today, a coalition of Texan nonprofits and the City of Port Isabel sued the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for approving the Rio Grande LNG terminal and Rio Bravo pipeline.

The groups assert that the project’s projected air pollution will significantly harm public health in the surrounding communities, and challenge FERC’s inadequate analysis of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) plans at the LNG facility. FERC’s evaluation of the project is inconsistent with the National Environmental Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act.

“FERC’s job isn’t to approve whatever the applicant wants– it should weigh public interest, health impacts, and protecting the environment,” said Nathan Matthews, Senior Attorney at Earthjustice. “What is best for the public isn’t whatever Rio Grande LNG changes its mind to at any given moment.”

“Our coalition has had to repeatedly sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because the regulator has never addressed the destruction and harm that Rio Grande LNG would cause to our low-income community’s public health and wildlife habitat,” said Bekah Hinojosa, co-founder of South Texas Environmental Justice Network. “If Rio Grande LNG is allowed to continue and expand its dangerous fossil fuel facility, it would be the biggest polluter in the Rio Grande Valley, spewing toxic particulate matter, smog, cancer-causing pollutants, and pollutants that worsen climate change.”

“Once again, the FERC is not doing a full environmental review nor consultation with our Tribe, doing everything they can to give the LNG companies anything they want at the expense of our Tribe and our people,” said Juan Mancias, Tribal chairman of the Esto’k Gna Tribal Nation. “FERC and the LNG companies have never consulted with the Esto’k Gna Tribal Nation about the destruction they are doing to Native lands and our sacred sites. We will do everything we can to protect the remains of our ancestors and wildlife habitat and endangered species.”

“Rio Grande LNG is wreaking havoc on the local environment and threatening our air, water, and local sacred sites,” said Roddy Hughes, Organizing Strategist from the Sierra Club. “It is shocking that FERC and the company continue to fail to fully analyze these impacts and do all they can to protect local communities. FERC must exercise its authority and finally put people over corporate profits.”

The plaintiffs previously filed a rehearing request in September 2025 petitioning FERC to rescind its approval of the LNG terminal and pipeline. FERC has not ruled on the rehearing request, therefore the plaintiffs challenged FERC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

DOE’s loan programs have historically operated on a stand-alone basis, without the benefit of full government integration.","Overview

The Department of Energy (DOE) office responsible for administering loans and loan guarantees—formerly known as the Loan Programs Office (LPO) and recently renamed the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF)—is one of the federal government’s most valuable tools to advance end-to-end American energy innovation. DOE’s loan programs not only strengthen U.S. energy and national security but also help keep energy prices low and the U.S. energy sector globally competitive. Through low-interest direct loans and loan guarantees,[1] DOE can accelerate the pace of innovation by bridging the gap between technologies that have been proven at pilot-scale and overcoming impediments to deploying on a commercial scale. Since their beginnings in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, DOE’s loan programs have received strong bipartisan support. They have also faced criticism over the failures of several high-profile projects. Unfortunately, these failures have created a risk-averse culture within DOE. Further, a lengthy application and loan closing process has persisted, presenting a barrier for many potential projects.

Recent congressional legislation has created the opportunity to consider new approaches to shaping the program portfolio and improving program execution. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) expanded DOE’s loan guarantee authorities to include already-proven commercial decarbonization technologies and projects. The 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) expanded the scope of eligible commercial technologies and limited the focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. OBBBA also significantly rolled back direct federal spending on energy technology innovation across the research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) spectrum. The net effect of these major statutory changes is to place increased emphasis on the role of DOE’s loan programs in federal energy innovation policy, prompting the need to reassess the Office of Energy Dominance Financing and its project portfolio and program execution strategies.

In October 2025, the Bipartisan Policy Center and the EFI Foundation (EFIF) organized a discussion among experts actively working on ways to cost-effectively leverage DOE’s loan program authority to foster energy innovation while benefiting the U.S. economy. From this discussion, three possible strategies for EDF to more effectively execute its mission emerged:

Shift to a portfolio-based risk management approach with increased diversity in acceptable risk of the projects within the portfolio.

Increase coordination among federal government activities to enhance risk management of the EDF portfolio.

Increase the efficiency of the application and loan closure process with revised credit subsidy calculations and innovative lending structures.

In the following sections, we provide details about these proposed strategies, including the problems they may solve and the opportunities they could create. Although these strategies are neither comprehensive nor the ultimate path forward for EDF, we hope they will serve as a catalyst for ongoing dialogue to maximize EDF’s potential to support America’s energy future.

20 Years of DOE’s Loan Programs

The 2005 Energy Policy Act gave DOE the authority to provide affordable debt financing for innovative clean energy technologies that are technologically proven but not yet widely deployed. DOE’s loan programs began with two distinct authorities:

The Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Loan Guarantee Program, which supports projects that reduce emissions with innovative technologies.

The Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program, which supports energy projects owned by a tribal government or tribal development organization.

The mission of Title 17, as set forth in the statute, is to “employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States.” DOE’s debt financing authorities were expanded through the creation of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (ATVM) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The law authorized DOE to issue direct loans to automobile manufacturers and component suppliers for light-duty vehicles and qualifying components that use advanced technology. The statute defined qualifying vehicle technologies and components as those which provide either a reduction in emissions or increases in fuel economy.

Over the past 20 years, DOE’s loan programs have played pivotal roles in providing early debt financing for major energy and vehicle technology innovations. For example, the Energy Department supplied a loan guarantee of $456 million to finance Tesla’s first large-scale factory in 2010, as well as a total of $4.6 billion to help finance the first five photovoltaic solar projects larger than 100 megawatts beginning in 2011. Since 2014, DOE has provided loan guarantees totaling $12 billion to finance the first new gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors in the United States in over three decades. However, as with any lender financing innovative projects, DOE’s loan program portfolio has not been without losses. The Energy Department has faced criticism over the years when a high-profile project, such as the Solyndra solar technology project in 2011, failed. Nonetheless the department’s successes have far outweighed its failures in terms of overall loan loss rate, which currently sits at around 2%, nearly matching the loan loss rate for commercial bank lending to projects that pose much less technology risk.[2]

The 2021 BIL expanded the eligibility criteria for existing DOE loan programs and created the Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program. Specifically, the legislation expanded ATVM program eligibility to include medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, hyperloop transportation, locomotives, and maritime vessels. The BIL also expanded eligibility for the Clean Energy Financing Program (also known as 1703) to include critical minerals processing, manufacturing, and recycling, and the legislation removed the innovation requirement for State Energy Financing Institution projects.[3] The 2022 IRA created the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Program, providing $250 billion in new loan authority for the new program, and increased loan authority for existing DOE loan programs and added $40 billion in loan authority to the Clean Energy Financing Program, awarded an estimated $40 billion in loan authority to ATVM, and increased the aggregate amount of available loans under the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program from $2 billion to $20 billion.

The 2025 OBBBA repealed over $8 billion in IRA appropriations for credit subsidies across DOE loan programs, increasing upfront costs for applicants. However, DOE’s authority under the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (1706) Program also saw major expansions in program eligibility in OBBBA to include critical minerals projects, reinvestment in all forms of energy infrastructure, and new electricity generation projects for maintaining grid reliability or improving other system needs. OBBBA also appropriated an additional $1 billion in credit subsidy funds for this purpose in the newly modified and expanded 1706 program, which was renamed Energy Dominance Financing Program (EDFP).

Today, the Energy Department’s EDF maintains five distinct programs with over $300 billion in loan authority (Figure 1).[4] According to current estimates, available credit subsidy across EDFP, ATVM, and the Clean Energy Financing Program sits at just under $4 billion.[5] Remaining unobligated credit subsidy is concentrated in the ATVM. Since the issuance of the first loan guarantee, DOE has issued over $130 billion in loans or loan guarantees for nearly 100 project locations. Currently, there are 46 active loans and 25 conditional commitments, totaling $118 billion. In just the last two months, DOE has finalized three loan guarantees for rebuilding transmission lines, enabling coal-powered fertilizer production, and restarting the former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant.

The recent legislation and changes in project activity indicate a continuing strong bipartisan interest in expanding the role of the Office of Energy Dominance Financing, with EDF being seen as a powerful tool to advance energy technologies. Given this interest, BPC and EFIF convened loan program experts in October to discuss the program’s future and develop strategies for maximizing the program’s potential. The discussion covered three themes:

Defining current opportunities for the loan programs to “meet the moment” and support energy technologies aligned with the administration’s priorities.

Aligning on the most critical new and ongoing challenges that need to be addressed to ensure that DOE’s loan programs remain able to effectively execute on the office’s mission and to identify strategies to address these challenges.

Sharing views on the overall direction of the loan programs and how they can be best leveraged to meet the nation’s energy needs now and in the future.

Three Big Ideas for Modernizing DOE’s Loan Program

FIGURE 2. Three Big Ideas for Modernizing DOE’s Loan Programs, as Identified by Workshop Participants

1. Diversify Risk Portfolio

EDF should consider shifting to a portfolio-based risk management approach with increased diversity in acceptable risk of the projects within the portfolio.

DOE’s loan program has a history of unclear parameters for risk tolerance that has often been misaligned with its initial statutory purpose: to provide financing for projects that could not otherwise access affordable debt financing to cross the “valley of death” between demonstration scale success and broad commercial deployment. DOE’s lifetime loan loss rate sits at approximately 2%, which is near the level of most commercial banks (1.3%).[7],[8] However, the DOE was never intended to operate as a commercial bank; Congress wanted the Energy Department to develop next-generation energy technology to enhance U.S. competitiveness by providing financing to projects that were not yet at commercial scale and thus could not get affordable loans from commercial lenders. When DOE operates within the narrow risk tolerance level of a commercial bank, it is duplicating commercial activities rather than focusing on its original mission of filling the financing gap facing early-stage innovative technology projects. DOE should consider developing a strategic and diverse risk profile across its entire loan portfolio that better reflects the market readiness of eligible projects within each program.

Inherent risk-aversion has persisted throughout the history of DOE’s loan programs and across multiple administrations of both political parties due to the high-profile nature of many of the program’s projects.[9] DOE has selected and closed deals with projects based on their individual upside potential and risk, and the program has subsequently been defined by the successes and failures of individual projects. Persistent criticism of the loan office and its staff after failed projects has led DOE to conduct overly extensive and conservative diligence processes with new projects. Without a portfolio-wide risk management strategy, accompanied by a clear strategic communications plan, the EDF’s portfolio risk will remain too conservative to fulfill the federal government’s role in bringing innovative technologies to market.

Workshop participants highlighted several key ways to foster a more strategic risk management strategy, including:

Define a range of acceptable risk tolerance at the portfolio level with bounds on acceptable risk that vary across the loan programs and reflect their eligible technologies, market maturity, and overall mission.

Consider setting clear, targeted program-level or subprogram level risk management goals (e.g., industry-specific or technology-specific) to increase the diversity of projects chosen and improve public communication of the purposes, priorities, and risk profiles of the EDF programs.

Clearly defined portfolio-based risk targets and goals across multiple projects will reduce the conservatism of project-by-project decision-making. This, in turn, will empower EDF to accelerate the pace of energy innovation by increasing the diversity of projects and technologies. Providing reasonable guardrails on acceptable loan loss rates or target return rates could help guide EDF staff to accept levels of risk more in line with the original intent of the program and its authorities. A portfolio risk management approach could also allow EDF to define different levels of risk tolerance for certain authorities or program areas where a certain risk tolerance may be desired, more politically feasible, or required to meet program goals.

Improving messaging around the performance of DOE’s loan portfolio to Congress and the public is essential to maintaining an ability to take the level of risk required to advance innovative technologies. A portfolio-wide risk management strategy could allow the office to redefine the program’s performance broadly across the portfolio or authorities, thereby not allowing a single project to define success or failure for the program.

2. Unstick Government Workflows

DOE should consider increasing coordination among federal government activities to enhance risk management of the loan programs portfolio.

Large infrastructure projects require interaction with multiple federal agencies to receive permits, complete environmental reviews, and comply with relevant regulations. Although not a problem unique to DOE and EDF, a lack of coordination across the federal government can increase risks for EDF projects. Better coordination could streamline multiagency reviews and help accelerate project timelines while reducing external risk within the government’s control.

DOE’s loan programs have historically operated on a stand-alone basis, without the benefit of full government integration. Operating in a silo can increase risk that could be better managed through integration of federal efforts. Infrastructure projects, especially for emerging technologies, are often decades long and require different capital structures for each phase of the project. A single project may require grant-style funding during the early development phases and low-interest loans for a later construction phase. Moreover, demand-side support, such as direct or indirect procurement policies, can bolster offtake certainty for emerging technologies and products. A lack of coordination among DOE offices along the research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) pipeline, along with heavy restrictions on interactions of different types of federal support across federal agencies, can place increased risk on EDF-supported technologies and projects. These obstacles can even prevent good candidates from applying for support from DOE loan programs.

Workshop participants identified three strategies to enhance government coordination involving DOE loan program projects:

Facilitate agency cooperation by designating “quarterbacks” to lead top-down multiagency reviews of projects, which will reduce external project risk within the government’s control.

Strengthen DOE’s agency-wide approach to energy technology commercialization to ensure smooth transitions across the RDD&D pipeline by instituting centralized cross-office coordination.

Reduce support restrictions that prohibit projects from receiving a loan or loan guarantee if it previously received other supply-side or demand-side federal support.

Designating senior-level quarterbacks for multiagency reviews of DOE’s loans and loan guarantees, or instituting a fast-track process for permitting, can increase coordination among agencies. These strategies could be deployed within the National Energy Dominance Council, established by President Donald Trump earlier this year, or the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, which was recently leveraged to streamline federal permitting for data centers.[10]

Coordination among DOE offices is needed to bridge the demonstration gap along DOE’s RDD&D pipeline for innovative energy technologies. Bringing innovative technologies to market relies not only on DOE loans but also on grants, demand-side support, and other transaction agreements issued by other DOE offices and other federal agencies. Reducing federal support restrictions could help foster an agency-wide approach to energy innovation, allowing for coordinated federal participation across the long life and diverse capital stacks of commercial scale projects

3. Increase Application Efficiency

DOE should consider increasing the efficiency of the application and loan closure process with revised credit subsidy calculations and innovative lending structures.

The elaborate loan and loan guarantee application process has led to long, unclear review processes, hindering projects’ potential for success before they even begin. Additionally, costs associated with DOE loans and loan guarantees rely on case-by-case, time-intensive credit subsidy calculations managed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that are highly conservative and may not reflect actual performance of the EDF program portfolio in more recent years.

Workshop participants identified two main areas for increasing the efficiency of EDF applications and loan closure process awards:

Revise OMB’s credit subsidy calculation model to better reflect EDF’s historical performance and loss rates.

Optimize underwriting processes by setting credit subsidies through broader risk-based categories and providing incentives for successful projects to exit the program.

Revising OMB’s credit subsidy calculation model and streamlining the underwriting processes where appropriate could save EDF both time and taxpayer dollars in the loan closure process. Creating a credit subsidy calculation model that appropriately reflects DOE’s historical performance and loss rates across the loan portfolio could reduce credit subsidy costs to both DOE and private-sector partners. Some participants suggested that EDF should also consider using DOE’s other transaction authority to lighten the heavy paperwork and requirement burden associated with its current application and loan closure process. Finally, if a project is successful, adding some type of incentive to exit the program (i.e., an option to refinance and exit EDF early, putting more money back into EDF’s program) could streamline the underwriting process, enabling EDF to issue loans and loan guarantees at a more appropriate pace.

Calculating credit subsidies by predetermined risk categories or profiles, instead of calculating at the individual project level, could optimize the loan closure process and enable a less time-intensive application process. Using standardized risk bands could allow DOE and OMB to apply consistent assumptions across similar technologies, reducing the need for bespoke modeling and repeated negotiations for each applicant. It could also provide clearer market signals by aligning subsidy levels with transparent, portfolio-based risk groupings, helping developers to better anticipate financing terms and to structure their capital stacks earlier in the process.

Conclusion

The strategies to modernize DOE’s loan programs outlined in this paper stem from a dialogue among DOE loan program experts convened by BPC and EFIF and reflect a shared vision to maximize the program’s potential to bring promising technologies to market. Although these recommendations lay a strong foundation for reform, they are not exhaustive. Rather, they represent an initial step toward a broader conversation about the future of DOE’s loan programs and how they can maintain their position as some of the federal government’s most effective tools for advancing end-to-end American energy innovation.

[1] Loans refer to direct loans approved by DOE and disbursed by the Treasury Department to the borrowing entity. DOE issues loan guarantees to borrowers to guarantee DOE repayment of these commercial loans. The borrower relying on DOE loan guarantees also becomes eligible to borrow from the Federal Financing Bank, a separate arm of the Treasury.

[4] In addition to the legislative authority to issue loans or loan guarantees within a specified authorization cap, the 1990 Federal Credit Reform Act requires that the credit subsidy of the loan or loan guarantee agreement be recorded in the budget as an obligation and outlay. The credit subsidy is the net present value of the probability of a future default on repayment of the loan (adjusted for any estimated recovery value from the disposition of the project). The credit subsidy is paid at the time of the closing of the loan agreement, either with a federal appropriation earmarked for this purpose or as a fee paid by the borrower. OBBBA rescinded the unused balances of credit subsidy appropriations for a number of EDF programs, with a new appropriation of $1 billion of credit subsidy for the restructured Energy Dominance loan guarantee program.

An expansion of 480 acres at the Congaree Bluffs Heritage Preserve was one of several conservation projects the State Fiscal Accountability Authority signed off on pursuing last week. The OK from the board, which includes the governor and state treasurer, is typically among the first steps of a lengthy process involving land surveys and purchase negotiations.

Altogether, the approvals would add close to 10,000 acres to South Carolina’s protected lands.

Among those is about 480 acres the Department of Natural Resources is looking to add to the 201-acre Congaree Bluffs Heritage Preserve, which overlooks part of Congaree National Park in Calhoun County.

Located more than 100 feet above the 26,000-acre national park, the protected land is known for stunning views of the untouched swamp and bottomland forest. If the purchase goes through, the land would “add to the natural and cultural significance of the area by providing beautiful scenic hikes and views,” according to an agency application.

A family trust is offering the land for $2.5 million, according to the agency. Several other protected plots of land run alongside the portion the Department of Natural Resources is eyeing, including about 400 acres the Audubon Society owns.

Once at risk of development because of the sweeping vistas and proximity to Columbia, the area has been a top priority for conservation groups because it sits so near the state’s only national park, meaning any development could affect the park’s habitats.

The land contains a diverse mixture of trees, including at least 100 acres of loblolly pines the department could harvest and sell, as well as mixed hardwood pines, according to the agency request.

Heritage preserve and wildlife management areas

Jasper County’s Coosawhatchie Heritage Preserve could also see an expansion after approval from the board.

The Department of Natural Resources is looking to buy 635 acres that sit within land the agency already owns. For $1.8 million, that land could become part of the 10,570-acre preserve that opened to the public in September 2024.

A total of 1,265 acres will add to two of the state’s wildlife management areas, which offer deer, hog, quail hunting along with hiking trails. The board signed off on final land deals for the areas, allowing the department to move forward with the purchases.

That included 774 acres to establish the Bobwhite Hills Wildlife Management Area, located on the line between Lee and Sumter counties. The area is an important habitat for longleaf pines and sits beside a 2,500-acre unnamed wildlife management area, according to the application.

The agency will fund the $715,000 cost through proceeds from fees for hunting licenses.

Nearly 500 acres will protect land along nearly a mile of the Pee Dee River, which flows into the wetland Marsh Wildlife Management Area in Marion County. The existing 8,700-acre preserve sits in a floodplain, and preserving the riverfront will make sure the aquatic habitat stays protected, according to the application.

Conservation group buys 8,000-acre forest in Georgetown County

The state will pay just over $1 million for the property.

New state forest gets approval

One of three potential new state forests received initial approval from the committee, allowing state officials to survey the land and make sure it would make for a good addition to the five state-owned forests.

Nonprofit group The Conservation Fund plans to sell just over 8,000 acres in Georgetown County to the state for about $36.3 million. The Forestry Commission would turn that land into Carvers Bay State Forest, according to the application.

Primarily composed of pine trees, the forest is one of the most productive in the nation for timber harvesting, The Conservation Fund’s state director said previously.

GRAMERCY, La. – ElementUSA announced a $850 million investment to build a rare earth and critical minerals refining facility in St. James Parish, strengthening the U.S. supply chain for materials essential to advanced manufacturing, national defense and energy technologies.

The company is expected to create 200 direct new jobs with an average salary of $90,000, which is 28% above the average St. James Parish wage. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 554 indirect new jobs, for a total of 754 potential new job opportunities in the Southeast Region.

“ElementUSA’s investment marks a major step in strengthening America’s critical minerals supply chain, and Louisiana is proud to play a leading role in that effort,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This project advances essential mineral production in the United States and positions Louisiana’s workers and communities at the forefront of a rapidly growing industry. As President Trump has consistently said, strengthening America’s industrial base is a top priority, and Louisiana is delivering the projects that turn that vision into reality.”

ElementUSA will use its proprietary processes to extract gallium, scandium, iron and other critical minerals from more than 30 million tons of bauxite residue, the byproduct of the alumina refining process. Supported by a $29.9 million U.S. Department of War grant, the company will first construct a demonstration facility to validate its extraction process and guide the design of a future commercial-scale facility.

“We are humbled and energized by the Department of War’s trust in ElementUSA at this pivotal moment for America’s critical minerals landscape,” CEO of ElementUSA Ellis Sullivan said, “This project in Gramercy will demonstrate how the United States can produce gallium and scandium at scale using innovative extraction technologies, reducing foreign dependence and ensuring our warfighters and industries have reliable access to these strategic materials.”

“Louisiana has supported this effort for more than four years, and that partnership has been instrumental to our progress. Now, with federal support in place, we can advance our prototype facility and move toward our full-scale vision: a world-class plant in Louisiana capable of processing over one million tons of bauxite residue annually and producing a suite of essential minerals including gallium, scandium, and iron, that will strengthen America’s industrial base and national security.”

Since announcing its initial plans in 2021, the company has advanced its technology and development work at the Gramercy site to support domestic critical mineral production. Over the past several years, ElementUSA has refined its proprietary extraction process and evaluated the site’s bauxite residue resources, laying the groundwork for this next phase of investment.

“ElementUSA’s investment decision is another clear sign that Louisiana’s strategy is working,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “By strengthening our competitiveness, aligning agencies through a whole-of-government model, and listening directly to companies, we’ve built the conditions that turn interest into investment. This project brings high-quality jobs, new industry capabilities and long-term advantages for Louisiana and the U.S.”

Construction of the demonstration facility is expected to begin in mid-2027, with initial production targeted for the third quarter of 2028.

“This project is a significant investment in our community, providing hundreds of new direct and indirect jobs, however, it’s also an investment in America,” St. James Parish President Pete Dufresne said. “Enhancing the United States’ only alumina processing facility, providing roughly 40% of the country’s alumina, is a critical investment in our nation’s future.”

To win the project in Gramercy, the state of Louisiana offered ElementUSA a competitive incentives package that includes the comprehensive workforce development solutions of LED FastStart and a $6 million performance-based grant for utility and infrastructure improvements. The company is also expected to participate in Louisiana’s Quality Jobs and Industrial Tax Exemption programs.

“ElementUSA’s investment in Gramercy is a game-changer for the region, strengthening Louisiana’s role in advanced manufacturing while securing a domestic supply of critical minerals used in defense operations,” President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc. Michael Hecht said. “At a time when global supply chains are under pressure, this project helps ensure the materials the nation depends on are refined in the United States. It also raises the state’s profile as a place where complex, strategic projects can move quickly from concept to reality.”

Certificate of Need law mandates that health care providers cannot expand services — be it new MRI machines, hospital beds or operating rooms — unless they are filling a pre-identified need.
“In 2023, the North Carolina Supreme Court granted review in this case to resolve foundational questions about the North Carolina Constitution’s protections for the right to earn a living,” Singleton’s lawyer Joshua Windham told Carolina Public Press.
Or, the Court of Appeals could certify the case directly to the Supreme Court.
Whether the Supreme Court would choose to hear it again remains to be seen.","A challenge of the constitutionality of North Carolina’s Certificate of Need law may be heading back to the state Supreme Court.

On Friday, a three-judge panel of superior court judges ruled unanimously against New Bern optometrist Jay Singleton, who alleged that Certificate of Need law restricts the right to earn a living and creates illegal monopolies.

The case was sent down to the panel by the Supreme Court last year, when the high court decided that Singleton’s argument was not just about his situation, but about the constitutionality of the law as a whole.

Certificate of Need law mandates that health care providers cannot expand services — be it new MRI machines, hospital beds or operating rooms — unless they are filling a pre-identified need.

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services identifies these needs by looking at population numbers, demographics and utilization of various health care facilities, services and equipment to see what local area needs what. Health care providers then apply to meet those needs.

Singleton wanted to dedicate a room to provide more complex, invasive procedures. The state told him it was illegal without a Certificate of Need. Why? There is no identified “need” for more operating room capacity in New Bern — beyond what is already provided by CarolinaEast Medical Center.

Singleton is arguing that the law grants exclusive privileges to CarolinaEast and creates a monopoly, while simultaneously restricting his economic liberty to earn a living.

The three-court panel, which consisted of Republican Judge Jeffrey Foster of Pitt County, Republican Judge Troy Stafford of Iredell County and Democratic Judge Jacqueline Grant of Buncombe County, didn’t agree with Singleton.

The panel found that the law serves the public interest, pursuing the legitimate purpose of protecting public health and affordable health care through reasonable means. They also found that no monopoly actually exists, considering that New Bern residents can access 80 operating rooms from nine different providers in the wider region.

Singleton’s lawyers are planning to appeal this decision, though this case has already been through the appellate process once.

“In 2023, the North Carolina Supreme Court granted review in this case to resolve foundational questions about the North Carolina Constitution’s protections for the right to earn a living,” Singleton’s lawyer Joshua Windham told Carolina Public Press.

“Last fall, the court sent us back down to the trial court to proceed through a three-judge panel because the allegations of our complaint, if proven, could render the CON law unconstitutional across the board.

“We have now complied with that instruction. The three-judge panel appears to have largely adopted the government’s legal theories, which remain as wrong today as they have always been. We look forward to taking this fight back to the North Carolina Supreme Court, which we expect will treat the CON law with the genuine skepticism it deserves under the North Carolina Constitution.”

If the Court of Appeals rules against Singleton, he could petition for a discretionary review from the Supreme Court. Or, the Court of Appeals could certify the case directly to the Supreme Court. That’s possible, given the significant public interest and constitutional implications of this case.

Whether the Supreme Court would choose to hear it again remains to be seen.

Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday, Dec. 15, announced that 17 projects in the state received over $1 billion in investments to create more than 2,300 jobs and retain an additional 8,600.

In Northeast Ohio, the larger of the two projects came from Eastlake-based aerospace manufacturer Poly6 Technologies, which received a nine-year, 1.597% Job Creation Tax Credit for a project adding a “new location to scale production for a key customer.”

The project is expected to create 164 full-time jobs and generate $10.5 million in new annual payroll.

“Next-generation engines require airfoil geometries of exceptional complexity,” said Ryan Walker, president of the Airfoils Division at Consolidated Precision Products (CPP), the parent company of Poly6, in a press release. “Expanding Poly6’s footprint in Eastlake allows CPP to meet those requirements at production scale and stay ahead of the industry’s increasing demand for advanced airfoil components.”

Manufacturing accounts for roughly 20% of the region’s GDP and is a $46 billion industry employing over 200,000 people, according to JobsOhio and TeamNEO.

“This investment underscores our region’s momentum as a legacy aerospace and defense supplier,” said Matt Dolan, chief executive officer of Team NEO, in a statement. “By choosing Northeast Ohio. “Poly6 Technologies, Inc. is tapping into a robust manufacturing ecosystem, and a talented workforce for the next generation of advanced production.”

Ohio competed with Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and South Carolina for this proposed project, according to proposals from the Ohio Department of Development. As part of the agreement, Poly6 Technologies must keep operations at the project location for 12 years.

Poly6 will invest $20.5 million in its proposed project, including $13 million for machinery and equipment and $7.5 million for building costs.

The other project comes from Solon-based analytics technology provider Ohio Lumex Co., which received a seven-year, 1.338% Job Creation Tax Credit for a project that involves acquiring and expanding into a new, 82,000-square-foot facility in Solon, more than doubling its current operational footprint. The project is expected to create 30 full-time positions and generate $2.8 million in new annual payroll.

(TSXV: GMG) (OTCQX: GMGMF) (“GMG” or the “Company“) is pleased to provide the latest progress update on the Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery technology (“G+AI“) being developed by GMG and the University of Queensland (“UQ“) under a Joint Development Agreement with Rio Tinto, one of the world’s largest metals and mining groups, and with the support of the Battery Innovation Center of Indiana (“BIC”) in the United States of America.

Based on its current state of development as reflected below, the GMG G+AI Battery has similar performance characteristics to those provided by High Power Lithium Titanate Oxide (“LTO”) batteries, which are sold at a premium price of up to US$1500/kWh. However, the GMG G+AI Battery can be produced at a substantially lower cost and therefore can be priced below that of LTO batteries. In 2025, sales of LTO batteries, which are used in many applications globally, totalled US$ 5.6[1] billion.

Battery Performance Update:

GMG is pleased to announce that it has progressed its G+AI Battery technology and believes that, once development is completed, it can meet the key target specification requirements for the main targeted battery use case as per Figure 1, including:

Charging in under 6 minutes;

Energy density > 100 Wh/kg after 1 hour of charging;

Long Cycle Life (10,000 cycles);

Safe (no Lithium);

Lower Thermal Runaway Risk; and

Likely no thermal management system will be needed.

Bob Galyen, GMG Non-Executive Director, commented: “In my nearly five decades in the battery industry, I have rarely seen a technology with the disruptive potential of GMG’s next-generation graphene aluminium-ion battery. With the possibility of charging from empty to full in around six minutes, this chemistry fundamentally changes how designers can think about electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and stationary storage. Instead of planning around long charge stops with large packs, engineers can optimise for rapid energy turnaround, with higher power, and safer, with GMG’s battery made from abundant raw materials. Lithium-ion will remain a key part of the energy landscape for years to come, but its limitations in fast charging, temperature tolerance, and critical-mineral supply are increasingly evident. By leveraging aluminium and graphene, the GMG team is demonstrating a pathway to reduce reliance on traditional lithium-based systems while delivering step-change improvements in charge time and power density. This is not an incremental tweak to existing cells – it is a new platform that can open markets and use cases that were previously uneconomic or impractical. As GMG moves from the lab toward scaled manufacturing, its primary focus is on proving reliability, safety, and cost at industrial level. Automotive, grid, and specialty-device partners are already engaging with GMG to explore pilot programs and early integrations. The companies that adapt quickest to this shift will lead the next wave of electrification, and GMG intends to be at the centre of that transition with graphene aluminium-ion technology.”

GMG is pleased to share the energy densities of the current GMG G+AI pouch cell at 60 minutes and 6-minute charging compared to other chemistry batteries on the market (Figure 2), and a voltage vs capacity graph (Figure 3) of its latest G+AI Battery technology based on data provided by the third-party BIC battery testing laboratory.

Based on that testing, the current stage of development, batteries produced by GMG and BIC had an energy density of 58 Wh/kg when charged in 1 hour and 26 Wh/kg when charged in 6 minutes. In 6-minute fast charging, the battery cells achieved 62% capacity in 3.2 minutes. The batteries had a nominal voltage of approximately 3.0 Volts and maintained performance over hundreds of cycles at 6-minute fast charging, without the significant degradation typically observed in lithium and sodium-ion batteries at such high charging rates.

Standard commercial Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt (“LNMC”) and Lithium Iron Phosphate (“LFP”) battery cells for electric vehicles and stationary storage are not designed for continuous 6-minute charging (10C); typical recommended charge rates are ≤1 hour (1C), often 2 hours (0.5C), with only limited fast charge operation. Only specialized high-power cell designs like LTO battery cells can tolerate charge rates of 6 minutes (10C).[3]

GMG has now developed a completely new hybrid electrolyte that is chloride free and noncorrosive, unlike common aluminium battery electrolytes, along with a complex cathode and anode technology that enables very stable fast charging over several cycles. The substrate for both the cathode and anode in the GMG G+AI Battery is aluminium foil – which provides significant cost and weight savings compared with copper, the substrate material used in most lithium and sodium-ion batteries. GMG’s technology does not include the use of lithium or copper. The Company has submitted an additional patent application covering these new developments.

Craig Nicol, GMG Managing Director and CEO, commented: “I couldn’t be happier with the GMG team to get to this point with our battery. We have rebuilt this battery in our weekly sprints from the ground up and developed completely new complex cathode, anode and electrolyte. This will provide a next generation fast charging battery technology currently not available in the world, and we look forward to sending out sample cells to test with partners in early 2026. This technology has many years of development in front of it and will improve as we keep pushing through known issues to improve capacity, voltage and reduce weight.”

GMG management believes that the Company’s battery technology can eventually achieve over 150 Wh/kg when charged in 1 hour, and over 75 Wh/kg when charged in 6 minutes. The Company believes further development of the cathode, anode, electrolyte and component weights will eventually achieve this end goal.

Battery Technology Readiness Level

The battery technology readiness level (“BTRL”) of the G+AI technology remains at Level 4, see Figure 5. GMG is currently optimizing electrochemical behaviour for pouch cells via ongoing laboratory experimentation. Through collaboration with BIC, it is anticipated that the battery technology readiness will progress to BTRL 7 and 8 since the equipment and processes needed to produce the G+AI batteries are the same as those employed to make Lithium-Ion Batteries.

Next Steps Toward Commercialisation & Market Applications

Jack Perkowski, GMG Chairman and Non-Executive Director, commented: “I am extremely proud that GMG has progressed its battery to this stage. It is a significant milestone for the Company because the battery technology has so much opportunity in so many applications – especially in commercial vehicles. I look forward to the next updates as GMG makes further progress in the development of its battery technology.”

The Company continues to see a broad range of applications for a completed GMG G+AI Battery – utilising its ultra-high power-density and economic energy density characteristics. Along with Rio Tinto, a range of global companies have confidentially expressed their interest in working with GMG in the following vertical sectors:

Currently, GMG believes it will use a plastic battery pack design, similar to Figure 8, to hold the battery pouch cells – reducing the weight, cost and complexity of using a metal case. Using a plastic battery pack is possible for two main reasons – GMG believes that its battery will not require a thermal management system or the fireproofing precautions provided by the metal case in a lithium-ion battery. Using plastic will increase the comparative energy density of GMG’s G+AI battery packs when compared to lithium-ion batteries.

Comparison and Market Review: LTO Batteries

As shown in Figure 9 below, the performance of GMG’s G+AI battery technology is already very similar to LTO batteries.

Figure 9: Comparison of Graphene Aluminium-Ion Battery (G+AI) to Lithium Titanate Oxide (LTO) Battery

Parameter High Power LTO[4] GMG G+AI Battery Rapid Charging 80% in 6 minutes 100% in 6 minutes Energy Density – 6-minute charge 37 Wh/kg (80% of Capacity)

46 Wh/kg (6 min +) 26 Wh/kg(Current)

Large upside to be confirmed Depth of Discharge Full Range Full Range Safety Safe Safer (no lithium fire potential) Longevity 70% performance over 20,000 cycles To be confirmed Battery Price US$800 – US$1500 / kWh[5] Lower price due to lower material costs

No lithium, no Titanium Market Size US$5.6 Billion in Sales in 2025 Under development

LTO batteries are sold at a premium to LFP and LNMC batteries, which are the main chemistries used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems, and are also widely used in other electronic applications due to their high performance and long cycle life. The material and manufacturing costs for GMG’s G+AI Battery are expected to be similar to, or less than, the cost to manufacture standard lithium-ion batteries, but substantially lower than the costs to produce LTO batteries.

LTO batteries have energy density ranging from 50 – 80 Wh/kg.[6] The LTO product is sold globally for use in many applications – with a total of US$5.6[7] billion sales per annum in 2025. Sales of LTO batteries are expected to grow at 10% per annum to an estimated US$ 9.0 billion by 2030. The major manufacturers of LTO batteries include Toshiba, Gree, Microvast and CATL.

Further details on applications for the LTO battery from Mordor Intelligence7 are described below. In many of the use cases for LTO batteries, GMG believes that its G+AI Battery can be substituted at a substantially lower cost.

Commercial Vehicles: Automotive, primarily buses, refuse trucks, and drayage tractors rather than passenger cars, is the largest user of LTO batteries. Fleets realize five-year total-cost-of-ownership parity once fuel savings and lower maintenance offset higher upfront prices.

Fast-charging Electric Buses and Trucks: Transit authorities need battery systems that accept repeated high-power “opportunity charges” during short layovers. LTO cells replenish 80% capacity in roughly five minutes, allowing operators to shrink fleet size without sacrificing route frequency. U.S. Low-No Emission Bus grants earmark more than US$1.5 billion per year, with bid specifications that explicitly reference rapid-charge capability. Parallel subsidy programs in China reimburse up to CNY 80,000 (US$ 11,396) per new-energy bus, accelerating volume deployment in provincial capitals.

Hybrid and BEV: Regenerative braking and high-C-rate acceleration favour the use of LTO batteries. Use in fast-charge EV stations is growing rapidly as ride-hailing fleets adopt swap-ready models.

Stationary Storage: Utility-scale batteries now cycle multiple times per day for frequency regulation, peak shaving, and voltage support. Energy-storage-system integrators adopt LTO batteries for grid-frequency response where state-of-charge swings are shallow but frequent.

Industrial Robotics: LTO batteries are used in continuous-duty forklifts that require partial charges during operator breaks.

Aerospace and Defense: Unmanned aerial vehicles, missile auxiliaries, and soldier-worn power banks operating from -40 °C to +60 °C ambient.

5-minute Battery-Swap Stations: Battery-as-a-service platforms require ultra-fast turnaround and high cycle life. CATL confirmed plans to install 1,000 swap stations in 2025 and 30,000-40,000 by 2030, each requiring packs that tolerate thousands of rapid exchanges without degradation.

Sub-10 kWh Packs: Cordless construction tools, autonomous ground vehicles, and medical carts select LTO batteries to bypass daily pack swaps.

12V starter replacement to Lead acid: GMG’s G+AI battery technology would be a viable 12 V starter-battery replacement for lead-acid, offering lower weight, longer cycle life, good low-temperature performance and improved cold-cranking capability, together with excellent tolerance to storage at 0% state of charge. In suitable system designs, the chemistry’s stable voltage behaviour can also reduce balancing requirements and simplify battery management, helping to lower overall system cost.

Lifecycle Procurement Preference: Many government procurement frameworks now weigh lifecycle reliability higher than purchase price. For example, New Mexico awarded a US$ 400 million bus electrification contract that included stringent thermal-runaway resistance metrics. Europe’s Clean Industrial Deal allocates capital for storage technologies that stabilize renewables, aligning well with LTO batteries’ fast-response profile.

Cylindrical Cells: accounted for 37.7% of LTO battery sales in 2024 as entrenched production lines and robust steel casings satisfied heavy-duty demand. Pouch designs address aerospace weight requirements and constrained dashboards in autonomous robots.

About GMG

GMG is an Australian based clean-technology company which develops, makes and sells energy saving and energy storage solutions, enabled by graphene manufactured via in house production process. GMG uses its own proprietary production process to decompose natural gas (i.e. methane) into its natural elements, carbon (as graphene), hydrogen and some residual hydrocarbon gases. This process produces high quality, low cost, scalable, ‘tuneable’ and low/no contaminant graphene suitable for use in clean-technology and other applications.

The Company’s present focus is to de-risk and develop commercial scale-up capabilities, and secure market applications. In the energy savings segment, GMG has initially focused on graphene enhanced heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC-R”) coating (or energy-saving coating) which is now being marketed into other applications including electronic heat sinks, industrial process plants and data centres. Another product GMG has developed is the graphene lubricant additive focused on saving liquid fuels initially for diesel engines.

In the energy storage segment, GMG and the University of Queensland are working collaboratively with financial support from the Australian Government to progress R&D and commercialization of graphene aluminium-ion batteries (“G+AI Batteries”). GMG has also developed a graphene additive slurry that is aimed to improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries.

The Trump administration is also enacting reforms at the agency level, including changes to the rules that messed up dishwashers.","Stoves, air conditioners, ceiling fans, water heaters, light fixtures, refrigerators, washing machines, furnaces, dishwashers, and more – nearly everything that plugs in or fires up around the house has been hit by federal appliance regulations that harm the very consumers they were supposed to help. The Trump administration has taken several steps to fight back, and pending congressional legislation would do even more, as I set out in my new analysis, Free the Appliances: Turn Out the Lights on Federal Efficiency Standards.

Most of these regulations are Department of Energy (DOE) efficiency standards that have been accumulating for decades. For example, washing machines have endured six successive rounds of tighter standards, while dishwashers and refrigerators have each faced four.

And all now face yet another round of ill-advised restrictions, thanks to Biden-era regulations that will take effect in the years ahead.

These rules raise the up-front cost of appliances. The upcoming light bulb rule will nearly double prices, according to DOE. The latest electric water heater rule will raise installed costs by an agency-estimated $953 when it takes effect in 2029. And the upcoming 2028 gas furnace standard, which will raise costs by up to $867, would make this choice prohibitively expensive for millions of homeowners. Industry sources also fear that these DOE cost estimates are understatements.

The cumulative effect of past and upcoming appliance regulations is exerting significant negative pressure on housing affordability, especially for low-income and first-time homebuyers.

Other rules compromise appliance choice, features, performance, reliability, and longevity. Dishwashers now take two hours or more to clean a normal load of dishes – a process that took closer to one hour before Washington decided to “improve” them. There is evidence that washing machines are less reliable, and that refrigerators don’t last as long. In every case, consumers bear the burden.

The Biden administration piled on four years of aggressive new standards for nearly every home appliance, including the already-overregulated ones. Climate change became the latest finger on the scale justifying the crackdown.

But elections have consequences, and President Trump is an outspoken critic of these measures. Several recent regulations, such as one effectively outlawing an entire class of water heaters, have been blocked by Congress and the president using the Congressional Review Act (CRA). However, others were not eligible to be reconsidered under the CRA and are still scheduled to take effect.

The Trump administration is also enacting reforms at the agency level, including changes to the rules that messed up dishwashers. These efforts are important, but unfortunately, they can be reversed by a subsequent administration, just as the Biden DOE did to most of the appliance reforms under the first Trump administration.

That is why legislation is the best way to protect consumers. Congress should sunset the appliance standards program entirely, but failing that it can take steps to make it easier to revoke the most troublesome regulations while raising the bar on any additional ones. Legislation should also end the practice of using appliance regulation as a climate policy tool. H.R. 4626, the Don’t Mess With My Home Appliances Act of 2025, contains these and other useful provisions and is well worth consideration, along with other potential legislative reforms I discuss in my analysis.

Done right, limiting or even ending federal appliance meddling could become the next 80/20 issue, and it deserves to be high up on the regulatory and legislative agenda for 2026.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1196974664-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 15:01:25.756394

Citing new findings from a Democrat-aligned climate advocacy group, Climate Power, ABC News on Monday reported that energy bills across the US have increased by 13 percent since Trump returned to the White House in January. This analysis was based on data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The report laid the blame for this increase on a few factors, primarily citing Trump's ""One Big Beautiful"" federal funding bill, which he signed into law over the summer. According to Climate Power, this bill is ""driving up utility costs and destroying jobs by removing cheaper, cleaner energy sources from the grid, all while funding new tax breaks for the oil and gas industries.""

The report also estimated that, due to the new energy projects cut or delayed since Trump's return to the presidency, the US has lost out on 24,958.5 megawatts of planned energy generation. Trump's policies have notably targeted green energy projects, scaling them down significantly or eliminating them outright.

This loss of energy serves to exacerbate another issue driving up costs, according to Climate Power: the proliferation of power-hungry AI data centers. David Spence, a professor of energy law and regulation at the University of Texas, explained to ABC News that demand for energy is ballooning in 2025, and outpacing production ""by a lot.""

""We're just not able to bring new supply on as quickly as demand is growing, and that's driving prices up,"" Spence said.

California’s environmental authority saw its key clean vehicle mandates challenged at the federal level.
For entities involved in California’s carbon and clean fuel markets, such as participants in the California Carbon Allowance (CCA) or Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs, the effects could vary.

According to Reuters, the proposal would significantly loosen the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions targets starting in 2027. This would replace the Biden-era framework designed to accelerate the transition toward electric and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) through 2032. Instead, automakers would gain more flexibility to continue producing gasoline powered cars longer into the future.

The administration has framed the proposal as a way to reduce costs for both manufacturers and consumers. Officials argue that easing the standards will prevent vehicle prices from rising too rapidly and protect US auto jobs by allowing the industry to adjust more gradually to electrification. Supporters in industry groups see this as a “realignment” of environmental goals with market demand. However, environmental experts and several US states say the change will increase emissions and weaken US competitiveness in a global auto market already moving towards clean technology. Independent analyses estimate the rollback could lead to millions of additional tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions significantly slowing national progress toward net-zero targets.

For facilities in California, this national policy reversal comes at a time with intense federal-state regulatory conflict that has generated significant political uncertainty. California’s environmental authority saw its key clean vehicle mandates challenged at the federal level. Utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA), the Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress successfully passed and signed resolutions that revoked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) waivers needed for California to enforce ACC II (Advanced Clean Cars II) and other major truck emission rules. This highly contested use of the CRA has placed a temporary block on the state’s ambitious vehicle targets. In response, Governor Gavin Newsom issued an Executive Order directing state agencies to explore all legal avenues to defend the state’s authority while simultaneously developing new regulatory strategies, including potential Advanced Clean Cars III regulations, to maintain momentum toward its 2035 zero-emission goal. This high-stakes legal and political battle highlights the deep regulatory differences, placing California and the states that follow its lead on a separate regulatory track. Despite the federal intervention, the state remains committed to pursuing aggressive vehicle decarbonization, which will continue emphasizing clean vehicle adoption regardless of the federal weakening of CAFE/GHG standards.

For entities involved in California’s carbon and clean fuel markets, such as participants in the California Carbon Allowance (CCA) or Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) programs, the effects could vary. Nationally weaker fuel economy rules may slow EV adoption across the broader US, reducing demand for clean fuels and credits in less regulated regions. Yet within California, stronger local standards will tighten LCFS credit markets and sustain or even increase credit prices. This environment could reward companies investing in renewable energy integration, advanced biofuels, or EV infrastructure as credit generation opportunities expand.

US entities operating across multiple states will likely need to rebalance compliance strategies to account for the varying regulatory pathways. California’s climate leadership may serve as a hedge against the uncertainty of slower federal decarbonization; offering stability in credit demand and price visibility when national rules move in the opposite direction. Additionally, corporations with voluntary net-zero commitments may look to expand participation in offset markets to compensate for potentially higher transport-related emissions, creating further demand for high-quality carbon credits.

Overall, while the proposed rollback may deliver short-term cost relief to automakers, it heightens long-term uncertainty across the carbon and clean transport sectors. For California-based firms, the state’s rigorous standards and market mechanisms remain strong incentives for sustained investment in low-carbon solutions. The difference between federal and state climate policies continues to highlight California’s role as a centerpiece of North America’s carbon market and a source of opportunity for those positioned to lead in the energy transition.",https://www.clearbluemarkets.com/hubfs/Blog%20images/Blog%20images%205-Dec-01-2025-07-30-14-6397-PM.png,N,,2025-12-15 20:59:03.196024

“Advanced recycling is good for the environment and good for the economy,” Crenshaw says.
“The Recycling Technology Innovation Act delivers much-needed clarity by ensuring advanced recycling is regulated as manufacturing and aligning federal policy with what most states already recognize.

Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Gary Palmer (R-Alabama), the vice chair and chair, respectively, of the House Environment Subcommittee, recently introduced the Recycling Technology Innovation Act.

The bill is designed to provide “regulatory clarity” around the chemical recycling of plastics and strengthen domestic manufacturing. Chemical recycling, also known as advanced recycling, includes numerous processes that break plastic scrap down into its original molecular building blocks, allowing it to be used as feedstock for new products.

In a statement, Crenshaw says these technologies already are operating successfully in 25 states, but inconsistent federal regulations have created uncertainty that deters investment and slows progress.

“Our problem isn’t plastics—it’s plastic waste,” he says. “If we want cleaner communities, stronger supply chains and real environmental gains, then we should be empowering the innovators who are turning waste into value. This legislation does exactly that.”

Crenshaw says the proposed legislation (H.R. 6566) provides “common sense regulatory certainty” manufacturers need and supports an industry critical to the Houston area’s economy and workforce. “Instead of chasing headlines or demonizing entire industries, we’re solving a real problem with a real policy solution that benefits workers, families and the environment.”

Crenshaw says vague and inconsistent interpretations of the Clean Air Act have left companies guessing about how advanced recycling will be regulated—a barrier to long-term planning and large-scale investment. He suggests the bill will solve the issue by regulating the technologies as manufacturing units rather than waste incinerators, aligning federal policy with the 25 states that already regulated chemical recycling as such.

“Advanced recycling is good for the environment and good for the economy,” Crenshaw says. “It keeps plastic waste out of landfills and out of our communities. It strengthens American manufacturing. And it helps ensure that places like Houston—home to one of the nation’s largest plastics and chemical manufacturing hubs—remain at the forefront of U.S. energy and industrial innovation.”

By providing a “stable regulatory foundation,” Crenshaw says the bill will help the plastics and recycling industries plan production, build new facilities in the U.S. and keep goods flowing through the supply chain without “unnecessary delays.”

The proposal has received support from industry organizations. For example, Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Washington-based Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS), says in a statement that advanced recycling technologies are essential to keeping more material in the circular economy.

“Today, inconsistent interpretations of the Clean Air Act create regulatory uncertainty that slows investment and innovation,” Seaholm says. “The Recycling Technology Innovation Act delivers much-needed clarity by ensuring advanced recycling is regulated as manufacturing and aligning federal policy with what most states already recognize. This commonsense approach strengthens U.S. manufacturing, supports American jobs and keeps valuable materials in our economy and out of the environment.”

In a similar show of support, Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, a division of the Washington-based American Chemistry Council (ACC), says America wants to recycle more plastic, and the bill is a “smart, practical step” that can help.

“Clear policy can help us turn materials we currently throw away into new products, grow American manufacturing and meet the demand for recycled plastic that brands and consumers want.”

The ACC calls the legislation a “crucial first step” in a suite of federal policies needed to spur investments and upgrades in recycling systems with current innovations that can capture, sort and recycle many more plastics. In addition to passing the bill, the organization calls on the federal government to recognize plastics made from advanced recycling as recycled plastic and to create national recycling standards to improve access and consumer understanding of recycling.",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/12/15/adobestock_161168962-web.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 15:01:40.274585

Should we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?","In the future, your ability to binge-watch your favorite TV show might be powered with help from the hydrogen isotope tritium.

That is, if experts at Japan's Kyoto Fusioneering and elsewhere can rein in the fantastic settings needed to harness powerful fusion reactions. Finding a sustainable way to capture the tritium fuel from the reaction chamber is a key step, according to Interesting Engineering.

Kyoto's team — with help from researchers in Canada — has developed a sieve that can collect tritium, which is hard to find naturally.

""Demonstrating the effectiveness of hydrogen recovery is a critical step toward scalable fusion power,"" Kyoto CEO Satoshi Konishi said in IE's story.

Fusion represents a nearly limitless form of energy that uses the same power process as the sun. The collision and resulting atom formation creates no long-lasting nuclear waste or severe meltdown risks, unlike atom-splitting fission reactors that already provide almost 20% of electricity in the United States, according to U.S. government data.

Affordably sustaining fusion has been the main hurdle for the science, and experts around the world are working on advanced magnetic containment devices and other contraptions to harness the super-hot plasma needed for it all to work.

Fission's merits are heavily debated. While electricity is generated without air pollution, critics cite long-lasting nuclear waste, accident risks, and expense as cons. For its part, the waste is a solid ceramic pellet, not ooze, and is often mischaracterized, according to North Carolina State University associate professor and nuclear proponent Robert B. Hayes.

On the fusion front, Kyoto develops gyrotrons for plasma heating. Its team is working with experts from Canada to build the UNITY-2 project in Ontario to test the full fuel cycle and other aspects of fusion containment, IE and the company reported.

The Vacuum Sieve Tray is designed to extract tritium from hot liquid metal that's made within the reactor. The fuel must be made there because it's hard to gather naturally and can't be mined, according to IE.

Inside the vacuum chamber, the liquid metal is dispersed ""into fine droplets."" Trapped tritium gas can then be pulled out. It's part of a full-circle plan Kyoto is developing to make, store, and use the fuel, the report continued.

Should we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?

Yes — it'll pay off 👍

UNITY-2 testing is among the final stages of testing.

""These tests validate key components of the Fusion Fuel Cycle System, giving our industrial partners confidence in our ability to deliver reliable fuel supply in future commercial deployments,"" Konishi said in IE's story.

The elimination of fumes is one of nuclear's clear benefits. NASA has linked air pollution to greater risks for severe heat waves that could soon make some places uninhabitable. Higher temperatures are also impacting classroom performance, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

However, cost and development time are other factors limiting nuclear's expedient reach.

Both amendments allow the US to better compete with adversaries like China and Russia, whose competitive state-backed financing and robust investment in advanced reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs) has grown their influence around the world and generated billions of dollars. If the US is serious about capturing the global nuclear market, passing INEA and the DFC Reauthorization is essential.

What’s in the International Nuclear Energy Act (INEA)?

INEA (NDAA, Section 8366) is a bipartisan bill first introduced by Senators Joe Manchin (I-WV) and Jim Risch (R-ID) in 2022. The bill was reintroduced in 2025 by Senators Risch, Mike Lee (R-UT), Chris Coons (D-DE), and Martin Heinrich (D-NM). The bill enables a more integrated and efficient nuclear export process through two mechanisms: robust interagency coordination and capacity building in potential export markets.

Interagency Coordination

Establishes Nuclear Exports and Strategic Infrastructure Working Groups. The working groups bring together senior-level staff from across the federal government to coordinate US reactor and technology exports with private industry and potential export markets. The US’s export process is comparatively complex, making it more challenging for new projects to ensure adequate financing, sufficient workforce development, and a robust nuclear fuel supply. The introduction of Nuclear Export and Strategic Infrastructure Working Groups will facilitate both interagency collaboration and public-private communication and, in so doing, create a more effective, whole-of-government approach to nuclear exports. The Nuclear Exports Working Group is also responsible for providing a 10-year nuclear exports strategy with biennial targets for the export of US nuclear technology, providing clear goals for the government and private industry to work toward.

Capacity Building in Potential Export Markets

Increases Support for International Civil Nuclear Programs. Federal programs such as the Department of State’s Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) Program and the Department of Energy’s Regional Energy Training Centers are efforts that support the workforce, regulatory, and policy development crucial to emerging export markets in regions like Central and Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. INEA authorizes additional federal funding to deepen early-stage cooperation between the public and private sectors to build capacity in embarking nuclear nations and get US industry into those markets at the ground floor.

What’s in the Reauthorization of the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)? Why Modernize the DFC?

The US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is the federal government’s development finance institution. It mobilizes capital to advance US foreign policy, national security, and development priorities. It is the only US international finance tool that offers direct equity investments, a critical component of capital stacks for large energy projects like nuclear power plants. The Corporation lifted its moratorium on nuclear projects in 2020 and has plans to invest in multiple nuclear-related projects, such as Poland’s first nuclear power plant and uranium mining in Niger.

DFC will play an important role in commercializing US SMRs and advanced reactor designs by supporting the financing of first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployments in more mature nuclear markets. This can spur cost reductions that make future deployments cheaper, particularly for the developing world which cannot afford nuclear energy at current price levels. The DFC Modernization and Reauthorization Act of 2025 (NDAA, Title LXXXVII) reauthorizes the Corporation for another seven years and greatly strengthens its competitiveness in the global market. The bill more than triples the Corporation's maximum contingent liability from $60 billion to $205 billion and allows up to 10 percent to be invested in high-income countries (HICs). Wealthy countries, defined as the top 20 countries with the highest gross domestic product at purchasing power parity (excluding Five Eyes nations), are eligible for investment in energy, critical mineral, and information technology projects. DFC can leverage this new authority to finance innovative FOAK nuclear projects in countries that can handle higher costs.

With continued and rigorous oversight, these new authorities allow for both flexibility and accountability. Reports to Congressional committees of jurisdiction, project notification thresholds for HIC investment, and narrow presidential waiver authority limit political interference in DFC’s investment decisions and ensure the Corporation is using its capabilities to advance US priorities, not partisan interests.

Why are they included in NDAA?

The US must compete in the new nuclear era now. INEA and DFC reauthorization address two of the biggest problems facing US nuclear exports: a lack of integration in the export process and difficulty securing early-stage financing for projects.

Both of the US’s main competitors, China and Russia, operate large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that act as “one-stop-shops” for prospective buyers that dominate US capabilities. They take care of financing, construction, operation, and fuel supply through a single entity. The US has failed to provide attractive alternatives, ceding control of one of the most geopolitically important energy sectors to its most bitter rivals. A strengthened DFC should be a primary tool for competition, as Chinese and Russian SOEs are not bound by OECD financing guidelines and can offer early-stage equity investments, unlike American reactor developers. To lead in the international nuclear market, the US must be able to offer comprehensive and competitive export and financing packages for international civil nuclear deployments. China and Russia already have the advantage, and the more time that passes with US inaction, the more the gap continues to widen.","https://uploads.thirdway.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=baseline-jpeg,quality=90,width=1200,height=630,fit=cover,gravity=auto/https://uploads.thirdway.org/products/New-Chapter-HG.jpg",N,,2025-12-15 19:00:59.660110

The EPA and other leading public health bodies have long measured the chemical’s health risks by its potential to cause cancer even at imperceptible exposures.
Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), that designation requires the EPA to adopt measures to manage those risks.
Since 2005, the EPA’s cancer-risk guidelines have used a linear no-threshold (LNT) model for managing risks, which assumes there is no safe exposure to genotoxic, or DNA-disrupting, carcinogens such as formaldehyde.
“I was pleased to see that EPA is revisiting their approach to setting occupational exposure limits (OEL) on formaldehyde,” Paustenbach tells C&EN.","For the first time, the US Environmental Protection Agency is suggesting there’s a safe threshold for formaldehyde exposure.

The EPA and other leading public health bodies have long measured the chemical’s health risks by its potential to cause cancer even at imperceptible exposures. In its updated draft risk-calculation memo, released Dec. 3, the agency now says that if individuals are not exposed to the chemical at levels that typically cause irritation under its conditions of use, they’re protected against all effects, including cancer. The move has sparked sharp criticism from public health advocates who say the agency is catering to industry and putting more people—especially workers—at risk.

“This revision makes a mockery of the review process,” Maria Doa, the Environmental Defense Fund’s senior director of chemicals policy, tells C&EN. “It ignores the EPA’s own cancer guidelines and the most important, internationally recognized, and thoroughly peer-reviewed scientific studies, including the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine-peer-reviewed IRIS assessment, and cherry-picks only what the chemical industry has long been lobbying for . . . which is a lowballing of the risk so that regulations will be less restrictive.”

Formaldehyde: ubiquitous and carcinogenic

Formaldehyde (CH2O) is a simple, highly reactive aldehyde gas that occurs naturally in human metabolism and the environment, and as a by-product of combustion sources such as motor vehicle exhaust and tobacco smoke. It is also produced industrially by the catalytic oxidation of methanol for use as a chemical intermediate in adhesives and resins, textiles, coatings, cosmetics, pesticides, disinfectants, and myriad other industrial and household products.

The chemical has been recognized as a human carcinogen for nearly 20 years by leading scientific bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) International Agency for Research on Cancer, the US National Toxicology Program, and the European Chemicals Agency. Chronic or higher-level inhalation increases risks for nasopharyngeal and sinonasal cancers and some leukemias, while acute exposures can trigger asthma, respiratory irritation, and dermatitis.

In August 2024, the EPA finalized its IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) toxicological review of formaldehyde, reaffirming that inhalation of the chemical causes cancer and poses an “unreasonable risk,” particularly to workers. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), that designation requires the EPA to adopt measures to manage those risks.

Since 2005, the EPA’s cancer-risk guidelines have used a linear no-threshold (LNT) model for managing risks, which assumes there is no safe exposure to genotoxic, or DNA-disrupting, carcinogens such as formaldehyde. Under LNT, risks increase linearly with dose, beginning with even imperceptible doses at which biological effects are more difficult to observe, and the effects are considered to be cumulative over a lifetime.

EPA maintains that formaldehyde causes cancer, but only at high concentrations

The EPA’s revised memo maintains that inhalation of formaldehyde, when exposure to the chemical (under most conditions of use) is above 0.3 part per million (ppm) for sustained durations, could lead to cancer—but if exposure levels are at 0.3 ppm or less, for “any duration,” individuals are protected “against all effects, including cancer.” That’s double the sensory irritation endpoint of 0.15 ppm that EPA recognized for the IRIS report. The WHO’s recommended maximum is 0.08 ppm for up to 30 min indoors for most people. It’s more than fifty times higher than the IRIS’s reference concentration of approximately 0.0057 ppm, which serves as a conservative end point designed to protect sensitive populations and those who are chronically exposed.

The agency arrived at the 0.3 ppm level because it is the end point at which “sensory irritation” is likely to occur. Controlled studies show eye, nose, or throat irritation is commonly experienced by many people when they are exposed to levels of formaldehyde in the air at around 0.4–1.0 ppm, though sensitivity varies widely.

A divisive distinction

The EPA points to politics as the main driver behind the stark contrast from the findings of its 2024 IRIS review and those released Dec. 3.

EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch tells C&EN that former president Joe Biden’s administration directed its scientists “to use one particular analysis instead of considering the entire body of evidence and the comments from external reviewers.” In contrast, she says, the EPA under President Donald J. Trump “is committed to following gold standard science and the law to make informed, commonsense decisions about chemical safety. A gold standard science review of all the information allowed EPA to move away from the default LNT model.”

The American Chemistry Council applauds the EPA’s revised stance, arguing that “the weight of scientific evidence supports the conclusion that formaldehyde does not cause leukemia” and that “clearly defined safe thresholds” exist.

Dennis Paustenbach, chief scientist at consulting firm TRC, also welcomes the move. “I was pleased to see that EPA is revisiting their approach to setting occupational exposure limits (OEL) on formaldehyde,” Paustenbach tells C&EN. “An OEL of 0.3 ppm would protect an estimated 90% of the population, including sensitive individuals such as asthmatics, even when exposed to concentrations up to 8 hours a day.”

Environmental watchdogs including Earthjustice and the EDF, however, say that the action represents a stark change from how the risks of carcinogens have been measured under the last four presidential administrations.

“The science on formaldehyde hasn’t changed; these are the same arguments that the chemical industry’s been peddling for the last decade,” Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, senior attorney for Earthjustice, tells C&EN. “The only difference is that they’ve finally found an administration willing to ignore the findings of its own scientists.”

Doa suspects that this reevaluation will set a precedent for future EPA reviews of carcinogenic chemicals, including a trend away from the LNT model in favor of safe-threshold benchmarks.

It’s not that the EPA is taking away protective measures, she explains. “They change the number and put in protections against that number, so people still think they’re being protected, but they’re actually more at risk,” Doa explains. “It should make people wonder if they can really trust the EPA.”

Is it finally time to buy Rivian stock?","Rivian Automotive (RIVN +4.56%) has been a punishing investment for its early backers, but that might finally be changing. Those who bought shares at the start of 2025 would have actually gained an impressive return of 32% year to date, even though the company still faces numerous challenges with scaling up its operations.

Over the next few years, management will likely continue emphasizing artificial intelligence (AI), vehicle autonomy, and software to attract the market's attention and potentially regain its once-lofty valuation. Let's dig deeper to see if there is any substance behind the hype.

Is the electric vehicle industry cooked?

It's hard to believe it now, but a half-decade ago, electric vehicles (EVs) were seen as an explosive investment opportunity. These new cars promised to disrupt the ossified, low-margin market for fossil fuel vehicles with the potential for higher per-unit profitability because of their potentially lower manufacturing complexity and ever-improving battery technology.

At the time of its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2021, Rivian had a market cap of over $100 billion, more than legacy automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors, despite reporting minimal sales.

Now, Wall Street has snapped back to reality. And it is becoming increasingly clear that EVs could become just as low-margin and boring as the vehicles they seek to replace. Stiff Chinese competition has led to a race to the bottom in international markets.

While the U.S. market is somewhat protected by a wall of tariffs, consumer demand in this country is actually lagging the rest of the world. The problem could get worse because of the rollback of government support under the Trump administration, which has ended tax credits and regulatory credits for EVs.

Is it time to become a tech company?

For Rivian, being seen as just another automaker is an undesirable fate. These stocks often generate lackluster long-term growth and extremely low valuations compared to their revenue. For example, Ford has generated essentially zero return (aside from dividends) since 2015, despite selling one of the most popular vehicles in the U.S., the F-150 pickup. And while General Motors is doing better, its shares have lagged the S&P 500.

Rivian is trying to set itself apart with a focus on technology and services, to encourage investors to buy its stock despite its premium valuation. Management has found some early success, inking a multibillion-dollar deal with Volkswagen for a joint venture to develop vehicle software.

The deal gives Rivian a much-needed cash infusion while also suggesting that the company has established an early economic moat in automotive software development, which has been a pain point for many traditional automakers.

There seems to be some real innovation here, with Reuters reporting that the company's software requires fewer electronic control units and wiring, which can make its vehicles lighter and easier to manufacture while potentially boosting margins.

The EV maker's chief software officer, Wassym Bensaid, seems optimistic that this segment could scale up, saying that many other automakers are interested in incorporating its software. In the best-case scenario, this could help diversify Rivian's revenue streams with licensing sales.

Is it finally time to buy Rivian stock?

Third-quarter earnings were quite good, with total revenue jumping 78% year over year to $1.56 billion, driven by strength in automotive deliveries and software and services, which jumped by 324% to $416 million in the period. With results like these, it's no surprise investors are beginning to pay closer attention.

While Rivian is far from a safe stock (the company burned through $983 million in the third quarter), things seem to be moving in the right direction. And the shares may deserve a place in a diversified portfolio.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F846854%2Fself-driving-autonomous-driving-getty-71217.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-15 15:00:30.494150

California’s economic strength California is not only a national economic powerhouse – it is driving the future.","California’s fusion energy sector, a “bet” sector under the California Jobs First Economic Blueprint, represents a transformative economic opportunity for the state. The new study, authored by the San Diego Regional EDC, finds that California is home to more than one-third of all U.S.-based fusion companies and has attracted over $2.2 billion in cumulative public and private investment since tracking began in 2021. It also noted that the industry has the potential to grow to between $48 billion and $125 billion in economic impact, depending on scientific advancements and successful project commercializations.

Last month marked a major milestone for the fusion energy ecosystem with the first statewide convening on the topic, hosted by General Atomics, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and the University of California San Diego in collaboration with the University of California’s Office of the President, the California Energy Commission, and the California Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz). The convening provided an in-depth overview of California’s emerging fusion energy landscape, highlighting recently signed legislation supporting the sector, state programs and resources, and regional hubs advancing fusion energy innovation, and also spotlighted the University of California’s announcement of $8 million in grants awarded to UC laboratories to accelerate fusion research.

Expanding fusion innovation through state investment

In November, the Governor signed Senate Bill 80, authored by Senator Anna Caballero (D-Merced), to accelerate research and development of fusion energy in California. SB 80 created the Fusion Research and Development Innovation Initiative, which includes $5 million to advance fusion research and development. This investment will help accelerate new technology capabilities that support project commercialization and continue California’s dominance in developing and deploying novel clean energy technologies.

Leading the fusion energy ecosystem

The fusion energy sector currently supports approximately 4,700 jobs across California, generating $1.4 billion in annual economic output. The state is home to both of the nation’s premier fusion research centers: the DIII-D National Fusion Facility in San Diego, the United States’ largest magnetic-confinement (tokamak) user facility, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the world’s most energetic laser for inertial-confinement fusion, where researchers achieved the first laboratory fusion ignition in December 2022, marking a critical step in fusion viability. Both facilities support a vibrant startup environment.

Advancing California’s clean energy future

California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, making it the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy. The state has also run on 100% clean electricity for some part of the day almost every day this year.

Fusion, the same energy that powers the sun, has the promise of providing a safe, carbon-free, and virtually limitless source of electricity. As the technology advances, fusion has the potential to complement California’s existing clean energy leadership, to play a role in helping California achieve its ambitious climate goals, to enhance U.S. energy security, and to expand global access to clean energy.

California’s economic strength

California is not only a national economic powerhouse – it is driving the future. The state is one of the world’s largest economies, feeds the country and leads the nation in new business starts, venture capital investment, manufacturing, and agriculture. With an increasing population and record-high tourism spending, California’s economy continues to grow across key regions and sectors – proving that innovation and inclusion go hand in hand.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GO-social-media-share-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 15:00:42.812052

This puts our energy system at an inflection point. Without key reforms at the state and federal level, brownouts and grid strain could become more common, impacting everything from homes to factories.

But with the right policies, new, flexible technologies like thermal batteries could help us meet this moment, making energy more affordable and reliable for everyone on the grid.

Right now, most industrial users draw electricity as they need it, creating spikes in demand that stress aging infrastructure. It’s a one-way system in which factories consume power and the grid struggles to keep up. In the residential sector, home batteries have already changed that equation, storing electricity during off-peak hours and using that energy when demand is high. Thermal energy storage brings that same flexibility to industry.

Imagine a typical stretch of the Midwest, where data centers are adding new loads the size of entire cities. Nearby, a large food processing factory is exploring traditional options to electrify, which typically draw electricity at all hours, regardless of grid conditions. Instead, it installs thermal batteries that charge flexibly when electricity is cheap and deliver reliable, cost-effective industrial heat.

The result: lower operating costs, expanded factory operations and no contribution to grid peaks. By charging only when demand is low, the plant makes better use of existing grid infrastructure and helps grid operators manage growing load volatility. It’s a win-win: We can power American manufacturing and improve grid reliability.

But to unlock these benefits at scale, we need to modernize the rules of the road for U.S. electricity markets.

Thermal batteries can lower costs and strengthen the grid

Today’s grid is strained by aging infrastructure, long generation queues and inflexible loads from data centers and industry. Electricity demand is expected to grow more than 2% annually over the next decade, and data centers alone could consume 6% to 12% of U.S. electricity by 2028, up from about 4% in 2023, according to the Department of Energy.

Thermal batteries offer a paradigm shift: they charge quickly and flexibly, consuming electricity only about one-third of the time while delivering dispatchable, 24/7 industrial heat. By drawing power when it is cheapest and least valuable to the grid and storing it for very long durations, they cut costs and stabilize supply.

For manufacturers, thermal batteries are a drop-in solution that unlock abundant, low-cost energy, boosting competitiveness and securing long-term energy supply.

For grid operators, they electrify large industrial heating loads without raising demand peaks, making better use of existing infrastructure and avoiding costly new transmission or generation buildout.

The result? A more efficient and resilient system with lower energy bills for everyone.

Modernizing legacy electricity rules

U.S. electricity markets were built around static loads. A few common-sense updates would unlock the benefits of flexible technologies, cut costs and strengthen the grid.

Electricity market access

Traditional batteries can buy power at wholesale rates, but thermal batteries that sell heat to industry cannot.

Instead, they pay retail rates that ignore time and location, precluding thermal batteries from economically charging when it’s valuable to the grid. This leaves U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage, shutting them out from accessing the gigawatts of cheap power that are at their doorstep.

State regulators can fix this by approving tariff structures that pass through wholesale electricity costs, while Congress can clarify that purchase of electric energy for thermal or electric energy resale qualifies as a wholesale transaction under the Federal Power Act.

Grid fees and interconnection rules

Transmission and distribution rules and fees are too often designed around outdated assumptions and inflexible loads. These fees are often fixed or poorly differentiated, ignoring the unique ability of thermal batteries to charge when the grid has excess capacity.

For thermal batteries to make better use of existing infrastructure and lower costs across the system, these charges should reflect actual system costs caused by new projects.

Grid congestion already costs Americans more than $20 billion per year in higher wholesale power prices. Flexible technologies like thermal storage could help reduce these costs by using existing infrastructure more efficiently.

When thermal batteries compete, ratepayers and U.S. industry win

Thermal batteries are being deployed today. Unfortunately, outdated electricity market rules in some places can hold them back, resulting in inefficient markets and higher costs for everyone.

A bold but achievable electricity market reform agenda that exposes thermal batteries to real-time market signals would help the U.S. realize the full value of this homegrown innovation.

With fair rules, thermal batteries can help stabilize the grid, lower system costs and strengthen America’s manufacturing base and AI infrastructure. Doing so would unleash some of the most powerful tools available to our grid while driving down energy costs for industry and households alike.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BTGpijEDQ66bbILKYLCa-My1t6JNLk6Aq9zt2jWRADw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9kYXRhX2NlbnRlcl9zdG9jay5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-12-15 14:00:14.406809

For telehealth entrepreneurs, behavioral health clinicians, and other busy professionals, the end of 2025 presents a timely opportunity to explore potential tax credits. Although I am not an accountant, I reviewed IRS resources and widely recognized legal and financial summaries to help you consider which credits to discuss with your accountant or tax attorney. Because tax credits reduce tax owed dollar-for-dollar, even a brief planning conversation could materially change your 2025 tax picture.

This article highlights several categories of credits you may want to explore with qualified tax counsel before December 31, 2025.

What Tax Credits Mean for Clinicians and Practice Owners

Tax credits differ from deductions: credits reduce taxes owed directly, while deductions reduce taxable income. Many business credits fall under the General Business Credit rules (IRS Form 3800), meaning eligibility, documentation, and timing interact in complex ways.

For telehealth practices, counseling groups, and small professional corporations, credits often relate to:

Hiring

Retirement-plan adoption

Technology investment

Innovation or software development

Clean-energy and infrastructure upgrades

Here’s what stakeholders are saying:

American Exploration & Production Council, American Gas Association, American Petroleum Institute, and Edison Electric Institute:

“On behalf of our combined industries—which supply a majority share of the energy infrastructure that powers America’s economy—we write to express strong support for H.R. 4776 the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. This bipartisan legislation takes critical steps to reforming a permitting system that too often chills investment, creates uncertainty, and increases costs and delays for essential energy infrastructure projects.”

Data Center Coalition:

“We applaud the bipartisan momentum this Congress has built toward comprehensive permitting reform, including Representative Westerman and Representative Golden's leadership on the SPEED Act…Faster permitting will mean lower project costs, reduced electricity prices, and more competitive manufacturing. It will mean American technology companies can build the data centers needed to lead in artificial intelligence, and it will mean that energy developers can deliver reliable, affordable power when and where it's needed.”

Google:

“Securing America's leadership in AI is fundamentally tied to energy. To out-innovate and outperform global competitors, we must build grid infrastructure that can power a new era of growth…Infrastructure permitting reform measures like many of those in @RepWesterman and @RepGolden's SPEED Act are an important first step. These reforms can accelerate critical energy projects, which helps lower development costs and boosts the affordability of power.”

GPA Midstream Association:

“The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) has become unnecessarily cumbersome and needs to be reformed. This legislation will help do just that, accelerating the development of critical energy infrastructure. This bill will also help ensure special interest groups cannot use the courts to stop energy infrastructure construction, which has been done in the past. We commend Congress for recognizing the need for durable permitting reform that balances environmental stewardship with economic growth.”

National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA):

“As you know, permitting and environmental-review delays impose an enormous cost burden on infrastructure delivery. For the asphalt industry — one of the core suppliers to federally funded transportation projects — these delays translate directly into cost increases, schedule uncertainty, and constrained capacity to meet community and agency needs. Beyond higher costs, permitting delays slow project timelines, disrupt planned maintenance cycles, and postpone the delivery of safe, reliable, and efficient infrastructure…We look forward to working with Congress to advance the SPEED Act and to support the development of a safe, reliable, and resilient pavement system that moves the American people and strengthens our economy.”

National Association of Manufacturers (NAM):

“On behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers, the largest manufacturing trade association in the United States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states, I respectfully urge you to vote ‘yes’ on H.R. 4776, the SPEED Act in order to advance reforms to our nation’s broken permitting processes, which will spur manufacturing investments and job growth here in America.”

National Stone, Sand & Gravel Association (NSSGA):

“NSSGA strongly endorses the SPEED Act and urges the Committee on Natural Resources and the full House of Representatives to swiftly pass this critical legislation. Thank you for your leadership in advancing common-sense permitting reform.”

Steel Manufacturers Association (SMA):

“The bipartisan SPEED Act is critical to reorienting NEPA toward its intended purpose. Building on recent congressional efforts and U.S. Supreme Court decisions, the legislation reaffirms NEPA as a procedural tool for considering immediate environmental impacts of agency actions. Furthermore, it sets reasonable limitations on judicial review that will preclude interminable litigation while preserving the rights of relevant parties. SMA urges Members of Congress to vote yes on the SPEED Act and support commonsense permitting reforms that allow our members to protect the environment and create jobs.”

Powers, D.C, Megawatt Daily",,,,,https://www.enr.com/articles/62219-power-sector-debates-new-federal-rules-for-data-center-large-load-links-to-grid,"But they caution that while tech firms would pay, more capital-intensive manufacturing customers with large loads may not be able to absorb high interconnection costs up front.
It is ""fundamental to ensuring the U.S. can reliably power data centers, AI innovation and advanced manufacturing,” the trade group said, claiming the current patchwork of state rules governing large load interconnections add uncertainty and delay to investments.
“This approach preserves a standardized accelerated federal pathway for data centers facing state-level delays, without penalizing new manufacturing projects locating in states that actively support industrial growth.""
The Federal Power Act is designed to protect customers from excessive rates and charges, they noted.
“If states do not allow these new large loads to take flexible end-use service or delay building power plants to meet the demand of the interconnected large loads, all of this effort could be for naught,"" said R Street Institute.","Given marching orders by a Trump administration cabinet department as key to artificial intelligence sector growth, independent agency Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) now is pushing to absorb nearly 200 diverse power sector comments to finalize by next April 30 a rule that would extend FERC's role in how data centers and other large power loads over 20 MW will connect to transmission grids—a long-held state regulatory arena.

The controversial mandate, which U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright directed FERC to develop and implement, comes as AI hyperscalers want expedited data center power connections while states and utilities worry about grid overload, reliability and ratepayer cost hikes and want more time for added impact analysis.

“While many FERC rulemakings take years to finalize —especially those dealing with contentious or complicated jurisdictional issues—the agency has about six months to take final action on the ... proposal,” says R Street Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank focused on public policy issues.

But U.S. data centers drove a 22% increase in electricity demand in 2025, set to triple by 2030, making them one of the largest sources of load growth, studies say.. With the power demand surge—the highest in two decades—also driven by rapid growth of large industrial energy users, “it has become necessary to standardize interconnection procedures and agreements for such loads,"" the Energy Dept. said.

Insufficient power supply also is leading to a decline in government and business investment in long-term assets that ""means lower economic growth in the long run"" for rich countries as well as developing ones, said Bloomberg Economics in a new study.

The FERC rule, proposed in late October, is set to address issues such as how to get needed infrastructure online quickly and how power will be paid for. While the Federal Power Act gives states jurisdiction over retail load grid connections regardless of size, the federal view is that linking a large load, which can extend to 300 MW for a data center, to the U.S. transmission system “falls squarely within” FERC jurisdiction under law even though the agency has not historically exercised it.

The proposal aims not to challenge state authority over local power distribution and generation siting, but commenters and others point to gray areas—and Wright has said new federal jurisdiction is in the public interest—claiming that administration priorities for American AI dominance over China and revitalized domestic manufacturing require an unprecedented amount of power and substantial investment in interstate transmission.

FERC uses a 100% participant funding model that would require large load customers to pay the full cost of grid network upgrades to expedite projects, according to a proposal analyis by think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies' Energy Security and Climate Change Program. It said U.S. data centers drove a 22% power demand hike in 2025, set to triple by 2030, making them one of the largest sources of load growth.

""This policy marks a sharp departure from the traditional socialized model, in which transmission upgrades are treated as shared infrastructure and recovered through regional transmission rates,"" authors say. But they caution that while tech firms would pay, more capital-intensive manufacturing customers with large loads may not be able to absorb high interconnection costs up front.

Respondent Pros and Cons

Among the commenters, the Data Center Coalition, which represents major tech firm and other owners and operators of the facilities, said the rulemaking will directly affect sector ability to plan, invest and interconnect critical digital infrastructure in a timely, predictable and cost-effective manner. It is ""fundamental to ensuring the U.S. can reliably power data centers, AI innovation and advanced manufacturing,” the trade group said, claiming the current patchwork of state rules governing large load interconnections add uncertainty and delay to investments.

The Steel Manufacturers Association is concerned about the required 100% transmission upgrade payment. “While data centers may be able to absorb these costs without rendering their projects uneconomic, new electric arc furnace steel mills almost certainly cannot,” the group said, proposing instead that new loads remain under state authority. “This approach preserves a standardized accelerated federal pathway for data centers facing state-level delays, without penalizing new manufacturing projects locating in states that actively support industrial growth.""

A coalition of industrial energy customers urged FERC to guard the ""cost-causation principle,"" which assigns costs to those who cause the costs, while beneficiaries are assigned costs according to their use or benefit. Issues include demand for new generation and transmission infrastructure without time to plan, permit and build resources. “The power sector must now grapple with the implications of speed-to-market as a cost driver and planning constraint ... without undermining reliability, affordability or access for any sector,” the groups said. The Federal Power Act is designed to protect customers from excessive rates and charges, they noted.

The National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, which represents ratepayers, termed FERC's proposed new jurisdiction an “unprecedented expansion” into the supply market, without enough detail. Reliable and affordable service must be “loadstars” that guide FERC as it considers reforms.

American Transmission Co., a Wisconsin for-profit transmission company, noted that many new AI data centers represent gigawatts of load and are electrically equivalent in size to adding a substantial city to the current grid. This “new breed” of data centers often have extreme operating variability and need to ramp load up and down by hundreds of megawatts on a second-to-second basis. “This is equivalent to turning Wisconsin’s capital city of Madison on and off, repeatedly,” the firm said, requiring specialty power electronic devices at mega-scale to safely integrate the variable load.

FERC’s 2011 Order 1000 requiring competitive bidding for transmission projects adds 18 to 24 months to new construction completion. “This was an inconvenience in the past, but it is a catastrophe in the race for AI dominance,” American Transmission said. The delays are incompatible with timelines to bring new data centers online, it noted, adding that the federal NEPA environmental review process also needs substantial changes to expedite projects.

Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities, said it seeks a 100-MW minimum threshold for large load customers to pay for use of the transmission system to avoid shifting costs to large customers not meant to be captured by the federal reforms. Interconnection service for large load retail end-use customers is regulated by states under existing regulations, and FERC must recognize that those customers use local distribution service, the group said.

Also it said transmission reliability studies must be conducted if existing power plants would be used to serve large loads, since removal of generation off the grid ""to serve a new large load raises significant reliability and affordability concerns,” the institute said. FERC ""must grapple with this reality"" and consider other steps to ensure that ""necessary incremental generation resources are available to address any resource adequacy.”

A group of southern U.S.-based environmental advocacy group said FERC could have jurisdiction over some aspects of large load connections, which would set a nationwide floor of protection against sudden cost shifts while states retain full authority to regulate retail customers. But they urged the commission to resolve ""many conflicting interests from all sectors of the industry,"" in the new approach, rather than ""rush to meet an unreasonable deadline for final action.“

MISO, the large multi-state Midwest transmission operator, said pursuing a federal one-size-fits-all approach could not only risk delaying the addition of large loads but also frustrate the discovery of new and innovative solutions “Best practices need time to be discovered and tested,” it said.

Microsoft told FERC that timely access to electric power has been and continues to be the biggest iindustry-wide obstacle to U.S. deployment of advanced computing technology. The tech giant builds, owns and operates more than 400 data centers in North America and other regions, and said it is in discussions with national, state and local stakeholders to support responsible growth.

Studying load and generation together has potential to speed up the interconnection process and reduce the scale and cost of grid system upgrades, the company explained. The rulemaking can aid collaboration among state and federal regulators to develop a nondiscriminatory framework for large load connection with user transparency, efficiencies, lower costs and enhanced regulatory certainty, Microsoft said.

“If states do not allow these new large loads to take flexible end-use service or delay building power plants to meet the demand of the interconnected large loads, all of this effort could be for naught,"" said R Street Institute. ""FERC has limited time to gather a record to craft and support any action, raising the prospect that detractors could argue [in lawsuits] that the final action is legally infirm.""

AI Regulation Issues Ahead

Even before the FERC large load rule completes, a 230-member environmental group coalition wants Congress to enact a data center moratorium to enable more study of risks in power and water supply, among other issues.

“The sudden explosion of the Big Data industry represents an existential threat for communities ill-equipped to handle the massive environmental and economic hardships these data centers inflict,” Wenonah Hunter, executive director of Food & Water Watch and other group officials told Congress in a Dec. 8 letter. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, instead urged groups to ""call for an ... energy plan that allows for the construction of renewables.” House Democrats Greg Landsman of Ohio and Don Beyer of Virginia on Dec. 9 introduced more narrow legislation to require FERC recommendations to avoid residential energy rate hikes in areas with data centers.

Also industry participants and observers are watching how FERC will rule in a dispute between utilities and independent power producers over major grid operator PJM Interconnection's approach for colocating large loads at power plants. The agency posted last week that a decision is on its Dec. 18 open meeting agenda. PJM has urged the agency to hold that action in light of the pending large-load rule, but one energy research group speculates that the meeting listing ""suggests a positive outcome for nuclear and gas plant owners hoping to contract with data centers behind-the-meter and avoid paying full grid charges,” said a Dec. 12 report in Utility Dive.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/14/DATACENTER-AMAZONDCs-colocated-SusquehannaNuke.jpg?height=635&t=1765735354&width=1200,N,,2025-12-15 14:00:20.050885

The open letter says, in part:

We call on you to follow your climate goals by publicly calling on utilities to commit to no new gas and zero delayed coal plant retirements to power your data centers. As the largest customers on the grid, tell utilities you need an affordable and reliable decarbonized grid that benefits all customers.

AI data center proposals have continued to surge across Indiana and utilities have sought to capitalize off the proposals by introducing new gas plant projects or delaying coal plant closures to power these data centers, thereby raising energy costs for customers. Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) estimates that Big Tech’s data centers could more than double the need for power in its service territory, and by 2030, just a handful of I&M’s service area could use more electricity than all 6.8 million Hoosiers use in their homes combined.

Organizations signing the letter include Faith in Place, Earth Charter Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council, Indiana Environmental Clean Energy J40, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, League of Conservation Voters, Public Citizen, and the Sierra Club.

Megan Anderson, Senior Campaign Representative, Sierra Club:

“As Big Tech continues to introduce energy-hungry AI data centers in our communities, we need their leadership to course correct to make good on their climate commitments by using their dollars to build renewable energy and infrastructure that makes our electric grid more efficient and resilient. Plans to build out more fossil fuel power for these AI data centers not only betrays their own company values, but puts Hoosiers in the position to foot the bill. Our local leaders and Big Tech leaders need to be loud and clear: Hoosier families and small businesses shouldn’t be forced to subsidize the energy needs of Big Tech through higher energy bills and Big Tech shouldn’t be increasing pollution in Indiana communities.”

Shannon Anderson, Director of Advocacy, Earth Charter Indiana:

“Meeting the existential threat of climate with significant action was already going to be the fight of our lives. The rapid, unchecked development of hyper-scale data centers powered largely by natural gas obliterates our hopes of achieving near net zero emissions by mid century, a commitment these companies and several of our Hoosier cities have made to our children. It’s not just wrong, it’s cruel to abandon our kids this way.”

Sam Carpenter, Executive Director, Hoosier Environmental Council:

“Hoosier Environmental Council calls on the tech industry to focus on sustainability, affordable electric bills for Hoosiers, and transparency as they seek sites for AI data centers. Careful consideration must be given now to avoid costly consequences for our communities and environment for decades to come.”

Our industry focus results in comprehensive state-of-the-art knowledge of the commercial, legal and governmental challenges faced by our clients and enables us to provide innovative solutions to facilitate transactions and resolve disputes.

Our Beginning. On November 1, 1945, two brothers, Searcy and Fentress Bracewell, just home from their World War II service, joined their father, J. S. Bracewell, and another leading Houston lawyer to open the doors of a new Houston law firm. From the beginning, the Bracewells understood that for their firm to succeed they must maintain a relentless focus on professional excellence. As they dreamed of building a larger firm, they also understood that the firm’s roots must be deeply embedded in a culture emphasizing personal relationships and teamwork. Finally, based on J. S. Bracewell’s great success as a statewide and community leader before the war, the Bracewells believed that a commitment to public and community service should be a key component of their firm. More than seventy years later, this commitment to professional excellence, to personal relationships and teamwork, and to public and community service remain the cornerstones of our partnership.

Born in the Courtroom. Our reputation for professional excellence began in the courtroom. J. S. Bracewell was well known as a fierce and relentless litigator, and the post-war era saw the firm assume and extend that reputation.

If the gains hold through the end of regular session, the stock will close at a new all-time high.
Since then, Tesla shares have staged a spectacular turnaround, marking yet another example of Musk’s ability to drive investor sentiment.

In November, Tesla investors signaled their faith in Musk’s vision, wishing for him to remain in the driving seat when they approved a trillion-dollar pay package for the CEO.","Tesla Inc. shares extended a rally climbing as much as 4.9% Monday and are on pace to close at an all-time high for the first time since December 2024, defying growing concerns about the company’s soaring valuation.

It’s been a rocky comeback for the electric-vehicle maker, whose shares have more than doubled since they hit a low in early April amid a wider market meltdown sparked by President Donald Trump’s tariff offensive. The stock was trading as high as $481.37 in early trading in New York. If the gains hold through the end of regular session, the stock will close at a new all-time high. Its last closing record was $479.86 on Dec. 17 last year.

“Investors would do well to remember that while having a robust underlying business still has a role to play, that’s not the main driving force,” said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Tesla shares are trading as much on sentiment as they are on fundamentals, and the core business is playing second fiddle to the AI story that underpins the trillion-dollar valuation.”

Tesla’s third-quarter results, released in October, disappointed investors as rising costs undermined a record quarter for vehicle sales. That surge in sales was driven by consumers rushing in to buy electric cars before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired at the end of September.

Those record sales masked a more challenging outlook for the EV maker. Tesla’s fundamentals have weakened rapidly this year, with sales struggling globally, profit estimates sinking and regulatory scrutiny rising.

Analysts now expect sales to slow significantly in subsequent periods. Industry leaders have echoed this prediction: Ford CEO Jim Farley said that EVs will plunge from about 10% to about 5% of the US market as Trump’s policies favor gas-powered cars. Famed investor Michael Burry, meanwhile, criticized the stock for being “overvalued” in a Substack post earlier this month.

Elon Musk’s political antics earlier this year had sparked fears that his interest in running the carmaker may be waning, and the company’s attempt to stoke sales by offering cheaper models of its popular vehicles were met with skepticism. Such concerns, paired with Trump’s tariffs and Musk’s public break from the president, weighed on the stock, which by April was down as much as 50% from the December high.

Since then, Tesla shares have staged a spectacular turnaround, marking yet another example of Musk’s ability to drive investor sentiment. In a move some view as visionary and others consider a distraction from the core business, Musk aspires to reorient his electric-vehicle maker as a robotics and AI powerhouse.

The pivot came just as AI fervor took over the market, pushing stocks spanning old-hat tech giant Alphabet Inc. and dark horse Oracle Corp. to new highs. Those who believe in Musk’s promises to change the world will have another opportunity to bet on his genius as SpaceX intends to go public next year.

For now, traders are buying what Musk is selling and growing bullish on Tesla’s AI efforts. In November, Tesla investors signaled their faith in Musk’s vision, wishing for him to remain in the driving seat when they approved a trillion-dollar pay package for the CEO.

The company has also received several upgrades and price target boosts based on its potential to dominate the automation space. Tesla’s street high price target sits at $600, after Wedbush’s Dan Ives increased it from $500 on Sept. 26, saying the company may be a “game changer” in AI.

“Tesla remains a retail investors’ darling and, in my view, an example of irrational exuberance in an already overheated equity market,” said Irene Tunkel, chief US equity strategist at BCA Research. “To my mind, Tesla is in bubble territory.”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/15/PDTN/87777424007-teslabg-xzj-2-ygutcnhfhdjlr-3-dbgmqtza.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-15 14:00:44.872291

Troy Balderson’s Reliable Power Act, a bill that would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct a top to bottom review of all regulations that may impinge on the reliable operation of the nation’s bulk-power system.

Introduced by the Ohio Republican in May, the bill now has 20 co-sponsors, all of them members of the House Republican conference.

The bill was advanced out of committee in June and has been awaiting consideration by the full House since then.

On Monday House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., announced the chamber would finally take up the measure this week along with two other energy-related measures.

The first of these, H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, sponsored by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., would streamline the environmental review process for energy projects and dramatically trim their permitting timelines.

The other measure, H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act, introduced by Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., would expand utilities’ ability to contest the proposed closures of power plants “if closure could impact electric reliability and affordability.”

Balderson’s bill directs the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, otherwise known as NERC, to conduct annual long-term assessments of the reliability of electric power in the bulk-power system.

It also establishes a process for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known as FERC, to review federal regulations before they are finalized if the electric reliability organization finds that the system is at risk of not having sufficient electric generation to maintain reliability.

If the electric reliability organization finds that the system does not have sufficient generation to maintain reliability, it must notify FERC that the bulk-power system is in a state of generation inadequacy.

FERC must then notify the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and any other appropriate federal agencies of the generation inadequacy.

Upon receiving the notice, the federal agency must provide proposed regulations that affect any generation resource in the bulk-power system to FERC for review and comment.

If applicable, FERC must provide recommendations to modify the regulations.

Federal agencies may not finalize such a regulation until FERC finds that it will not be likely to have a significant negative impact on the ability of the bulk-power system to supply sufficient electric energy necessary to maintain an adequate level of reliability.

Speaking before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in June, Balderson said the panel’s decision to advance his bill marked a “major step toward strengthening the reliability of our electric grid and ensuring long-term accountability from regulatory agencies in Washington.”

The report is the fourth edition in the IEA’s series and analyses the evolution of skilled labour requirements since the inaugural report in 2022.

Its data is compiled from the Energy Employment Survey which gathers insights from more than 700 energy companies, trade unions and educational bodies.

The analysis reveals the energy sector has added more than 1.6 million skilled trade positions since 2015.

Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, says: “Energy has been one of the strongest and most consistent engines of job creation in the global economy during a period marked by significant uncertainties.

“But this momentum cannot be taken for granted. The world’s ability to build the energy infrastructure it needs depends on having enough skilled workers in place.

“Governments, industry and training institutions must come together to close the labour and skills gap. Left unaddressed, these shortages could slow progress raise costs and weaken energy security.”

Electrification and changing employment patterns

The electricity sector has experienced a significant expansion, adding 3.9 million jobs since 2020.

This accounts for nearly three quarters of all new employment in the energy industry.

For the first time, the electricity sector, which includes generation, transmission, distribution and storage, is now the largest energy employer, surpassing fuel supply.

This global move towards electrification is reshaping the nature of employment.

The report highlights continued growth in vehicle manufacturing employment caused by a rise of almost 800,000 jobs related to electric vehicles (EVs) in 2024.

In China for example, the IEA found that nearly 40% of all vehicle manufacturing roles are now associated with EVs and their batteries.

This expansion is accommodated by workers retraining and transitioning into new roles, as well as the creation of new positions in areas such as battery manufacturing and electric equipment installation.

Supply and demand for a skilled workforce

The World Energy Employment report indicates that hiring bottlenecks present a critical challenge, with more than half of the firms and unions surveyed reporting them.

Shortages are particularly pronounced in applied technical roles, which constitute more than half of the energy workforce.

The roles in shortest supply include electricians, pipefitters, electrical power-line workers and engineers.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/4c4c3652297eebed86b10487464185ef:d7db8134f59cff28d28853df63b33417/wee.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:59:43.587758

After my graduation on Dec. 18, I’m moving to Washington, D.C., to pursue a career in agricultural policy and communications.
If it weren’t for Texas A&M, I don’t think I’d be taking this step in my career.
No matter where I end up, I’ll always be thankful for my time at Texas A&M and the mark this place has left on my heart.","The word “home” means different things to everyone. For some, it’s the house they grew up in or a person who shaped their fondest memories. For others, it’s more of a feeling than a person or place.

Cole Baerlocher ’26 has called several places home. For the first 20 years of his life, it was Colfax, Washington. In a few weeks, home will become Washington, D.C.

But for the past three years, home has been College Station.

Baerlocher talked with us about his upbringing in agriculture, serving as the National FFA president, moving over 2,000 miles away from his hometown to become an Aggie and what’s next for him in Washington, D.C.

Most importantly, he discussed how the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has been his home away from home and how it changed the trajectory of his life.

Tell us about yourself.

I grew up in a small rural community in Washington and was involved with my grandparents’ wheat and cattle operation from a young age. I have fond memories of riding combines and checking cows with my grandpa – I think that’s where my love for agriculture began.

After graduating from high school, I took a gap year to serve as the state president for Washington FFA. Following that year of service, I ran for national FFA office and was selected as president. Those experiences really shaped me as a person and allowed me to give back to others.

Why did you choose to attend Texas A&M University?

During my year as a national officer, I took a three-day trip to College Station and immediately fell in love with Texas A&M. On the flight back to the National FFA headquarters in Indianapolis, I remember feeling sad, like I was leaving a home.

I knew I wanted to be an Aggie, so I applied and was accepted into the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communications. Coming to Texas A&M was the best decision I ever made, and it has impacted the trajectory of my life in so many ways.

How did your time as a national officer help your transition to Texas A&M?

I had the opportunity to connect with people from all walks of life as a national officer. At the beginning of my year of service, I set a goal for myself: be the kind of person who can build relationships with anyone and meet them exactly where they’re at.

It didn’t take long to realize that’s what it means to be an Aggie, too. Community has always been important to me, and the community at Texas A&M is unlike any other.

Aggies make sure nobody is left behind; that’s why we have traditions like Muster, Silver Taps and Bonfire Memorial. That’s why my professors and peers in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences know me by name and make time to have genuine conversations.

The qualities I wanted to emulate as a national officer are the same qualities I met with when I came to Texas A&M; that’s how I knew I was in the right place.

What was your involvement like on campus?

I got involved at Texas A&M right away. I was so excited to be a student here and didn’t want to take any opportunity for granted.

For me, that was getting involved with Aggie ACHIEVEMates, joining a student government committee, serving as a Muster host and being a Fish Camp counselor. I had several student worker jobs throughout college, including working with Texas A&M AgriLife Marketing and Communications and the Board of Regents. I participated in all the Aggie traditions and tried to treasure every second spent on campus.

What makes the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences unique?

The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences has truly become a family for me. Not a day goes by that I don’t run into a friend from the College on campus and have a meaningful conversation with them.

We have the greatest faculty, staff and students in the world, and I love how there’s such an emphasis on excellence. My classes and activities have prepared me to excel when I step into the workforce. The academic rigor and thriving community at Texas A&M are unmatched, and I’m so grateful to be part of it.

What advice would you give incoming students?

My best advice is to put yourself out there: go out for that organization, apply for that club and make friends with people you don’t think you have anything in common with. That’s where the most learning and growing will take place. You’ll get accepted to some opportunities and rejected from others, but it’s important to be just as grateful for both. The “noes” have shaped me just as much as the “yeses.”

What’s next for you?

After my graduation on Dec. 18, I’m moving to Washington, D.C., to pursue a career in agricultural policy and communications. I was fortunate to participate in the Agricultural and Natural Resources Policy Internship Program, which laid the foundation for my love of policy and appreciation for the culture in Washington, D.C.

Overall, every experience I’ve had during college has prepared me for this transition. If it weren’t for Texas A&M, I don’t think I’d be taking this step in my career. I love knowing I’ll have a network of fellow Aggies cheering me on, even after I move away from College Station. That alone is a testament to the culture of caring we have here.

NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico — Silvia Fernández Gallardo Boone leaned over a stream of water rushing through a concrete chute at the city’s wastewater treatment plant.

“Smell it!” she said, beaming.

Odorless, treated wastewater flowed into the Coyote Arroyo, or creek, then the Rio Grande. Mere months earlier, more than 12 million gallons of raw sewage were leaking every day into the river and groundwater in Nuevo Laredo. After repairs to the treatment plant, to Fernández Gallardo’s delight, the flow of untreated wastewater has been significantly reduced.

“Being on the border, we really live our lives on both sides of the river,” Fernández Gallardo said, looking out at the treatment plant. “We all have a stake in taking care of the river.”

When Carmen Lilia Canturosas was elected mayor of Nuevo Laredo in 2021, deferred maintenance had debilitated the plant. To make matters worse, broken sewer lines were leaking wastewater onto city streets. Canturosas, re-elected in 2024, threw her support behind overhauling Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater and sewer system.

Fernández Gallardo, an architect by training, was appointed general manager of the Potable Water and Sanitation Commission (Comisión de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado), known by its Spanish acronym COMAPA. In 2023, COMAPA broke ground on an $80 million project, backed by U.S. and Mexican institutions, to repair the failing wastewater treatment plant and damaged sewer lines. The North American Development Bank (NADBank) issued the largest grant for wastewater improvements in its 30-year history.

Shared waterways like the Rio Grande have been sites of cooperation between the two countries, but also points of contention. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater overhaul is the latest bet that the U.S. and Mexico can work together to improve water quality and the environment.

But the project is reaching fruition as tensions mount between the U.S. and Mexico under the second Trump presidency. Mexico once again has fallen short on its treaty commitment to share Rio Grande water with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff demands have cast a shadow over trade hubs like Laredo-Nuevo Laredo.

Far from the policy disputes of Washington, D.C., officials like Fernández Gallardo are still counting on binational collaboration to yield tangible benefits for local residents.

“Rehabilitating the Rio Bravo doesn’t just mean improving local environmental conditions,” she wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News, using the Mexican name for the river. “It also represents an opportunity to move toward shared water security between Mexico and the United States.”

Monitoring water quality

The day before Fernández Gallardo toured the plant, Martin Castro and Tom Vaughan were on the other side of the border, knee deep in the Rio Grande. Four Border Patrol officers peered out from an outcropping above the river and asked what they were doing.

Castro, watershed science director at the Rio Grande International Study Center, and Vaughan, a center co-founder and emeritus biology professor at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, calmly explained that they were taking water quality samples. A few minutes later, the officers left.

The pair were collecting samples to contribute to an extensive database on the river’s water quality, as they do every month.

On that late October day, Border Patrol and National Guard troops far outnumbered fishermen and other recreational visitors to the Rio Grande. It’s not only the law enforcement presence that makes environmental protection on the Rio Grande unique.

As an international river, the Rio Grande was initially excluded from the Texas Clean Rivers Program. The collaborative effort monitors and protects the state’s water resources. Vaughan was among those who advocated in the 1990s for the Rio Grande to be included.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), a federal agency that enforces the border and water agreements, eventually took over water quality monitoring on the river. IBWC data from the Rio Grande now feeds into the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Clean Rivers Program.

For more than 1,200 miles, the Rio Grande snakes between Texas and Mexico, crossing remote deserts and urban areas before reaching its delta at the Gulf of Mexico. IBWC partners with organizations like the Rio Grande study center to collect water samples at 119 stations. Monitoring at eight stations in El Paso was suspended in 2023 because of border security installations. IBWC spokesperson Frank Fisher said sampling has been re-established at all but three sites.

Castro and Vaughan collected samples to send to a certified laboratory. They record other measurements themselves, such as turbidity using a Secchi disk.

“Upriver, I would swim in it,” Vaughan said, referring to the Rio Grande upstream of the bend in the river that wraps around Laredo. “If I was really thirsty, I might drink it.”

But he explained that sewage downstream of the city makes the water unsafe for swimming or other contact recreation. This part of the Rio Grande below the Amistad Reservoir, known as segment 2304, exceeds Texas standards for bacteria.

In this stretch of the river, the highest readings for E. coli, the indicator for bacteria, are downstream of Laredo and the wastewater discharges from Nuevo Laredo, according to IBWC’s 2024 Rio Grande summary report. At the Pipeline Crossing and El Cenizo sites, E. coli readings were 240,000 parts per 100 milliliters. That is nearly 2,000 times the state’s water quality standard of 126 parts.

The IBWC report warns of “serious health risks” and that the water is unsuitable for recreational activities or consumption. The report attributes the high bacteria levels to wastewater infrastructure allowing sewage to enter the river.

IBWC’s Fisher said bacteria levels are elevated in other parts of the river including in the urban areas of El Paso/Ciudad Juárez, Del Rio/Ciudad Acuña, Eagle Pass/Piedras Negras, and in Hidalgo County.

“TCEQ is committed to advancing collaboration among federal, state, and binational partners to improve water quality and resilience in the border region,” said Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Victoria Cann.

Cann referenced the Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative as one example of the agency’s efforts to improve water management. The initiative aims to “restore, protect and improve” water quality on the Lower Rio Grande downstream of Falcon Reservoir. The group recently completed an 18-month binational salinity study, according to Cann.

Cleaning up the Rio Grande

It’s one thing to collect data on the river’s water quality. It’s another to act on that data. For decades, the U.S. and Mexico have debated how to improve the environment and sanitation along their nearly 2,000-mile border.

The 1944 water treaty between the two countries entrusted border sanitation issues to the IBWC. As new problems cropped up — like sewage flowing downhill from Mexico into the U.S. — new agreements, known as minutes, were added to the treaty. In 1989, the U.S. and Mexico partnered to build a wastewater treatment plant in Nuevo Laredo.

After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was adopted in 1994, Nuevo Laredo and other border cities grew rapidly. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater treatment plant opened in 1996. Binational wastewater treatment plants were also built in Tijuana, Baja California and Nogales, Arizona.

In a side agreement to NAFTA, the two countries created the NADBank, a binational development bank to fund infrastructure on the border.

Nuevo Laredo’s population has almost doubled since 1994, to nearly half a million people. Laredo, with about 260,000 people, is now the busiest land port for international trade in the United States.

But ongoing maintenance of wastewater infrastructure became a sticking point. By the time NAFTA was renegotiated in 2020 — and renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement — border wastewater treatment plants were in urgent need of repairs. Sewage flowing from Tijuana into Southern California became an international dispute.

Colorado State University emeritus political scientist Stephen Mumme, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations, partially attributes maintenance problems to the “constant churn” in Mexican politics, in which local administrations change every three years.

Mexican cities also struggle to finance long-term infrastructure projects and collect monthly bills from ratepayers. Sanitation competes with other urgent public works in border cities buckling under rapid growth.

“The capacity to engage in the type of financing and planning that is often taken for granted in American cities is not yet fully realized in Mexican cities, even in border cities,” Mumme said.

Jesús Frausto Ortega, coordinator of the water management graduate program at Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Monterrey, Mexico, said that previous efforts to stop the flow of sewage in Nuevo Laredo were like paving over a pothole.

“You could fix one part, but there was no holistic solution,” said Frausto Ortega, who previously worked in Nuevo Laredo.

He said Mexican cities often lack political will to invest in sanitation infrastructure.

“Traditionally, officials don’t invest in projects that are underground,” he said. “[That’s because] the public doesn’t see the project and we don’t have reliable accountability mechanisms.”

COMAPA’s Fernández Gallardo said she heard this sentiment from other public officials.

“Why would you want to invest in sewer lines?” she remembers them asking. “That’s like burying money.”

Binational investment

Fernández Gallardo and Canturosas, the mayor, persisted. They found support among U.S. officials, including then U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar and then IBWC Commissioner Maria-Elena Giner. NADBank provided an initial $650,000 grant to develop plans for the wastewater treatment plant and collapsed sewer lines.

Support started to pour in. NADBank committed $22 million from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Border Environment Infrastructure Fund. Mexican agencies, including COMAPA, committed another $53 million. The IBWC pitched in $2 million, and a commercial loan of $6 million rounded out the budget.

IBWC’s Fisher said the agency’s contribution came “as part of a long-standing practice to share the cost of extraordinary maintenance.” He said the funds were used to purchase six aerators needed for the biological process at the plant.

NADBank Managing Director John Beckham said that the significant commitments from both countries set the effort apart.

“Those are unique features of this project that are replicable,” he said. “We’re proud of it. We think it’s something that can help us in other parts of the river.”

Fernández Gallardo estimated in late October that the wastewater treatment plant’s rehabilitation was 80% complete. She said that sewage was still being discharged at 10 locations in the city, down from 27.

“You’re investing in a public good,” she said. “These are projects that you don’t see, but you feel the difference in the city.”

Fernández Gallardo acknowledged that COMAPA must prevent deferred maintenance from once again hobbling the plant. She said that going forward, 4% of funds from water bills will be designated for maintenance.

Beckham added: “[We have to] ensure that these plants can be maintained over time … To avoid cycles of every 25 years where we have to lay out $80 million.”

Martin Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the upgrades are a “meaningful milestone.”

“They underscore how urgently the river needs sustained infrastructure investment,” he said. “Continued investment and binational cooperation are essential to protect water quality for both communities.”

Changing political, environmental climate

While Nuevo Laredo is making strides, extreme drought and climate change are testing the fragile balance on the binational river. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for over 6 million people in the United States and Mexico. Farmers from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico rely on it to irrigate their crops.

But experts warn that current water consumption levels cannot be sustained. The Amistad Reservoir, upstream of Laredo, hit historic lows during July 2024. Climate change will further reduce the river’s flow.

A November 2025 study led by the World Wildlife Fund found that 52% of water consumption in the Rio Grande Basin is unsustainable, causing depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and river flows. American Rivers named the Lower Rio Grande the fifth most endangered river in the United States this year.

The Rio Grande is the only source of water for Nuevo Laredo and Laredo. But sometimes the river drops so low that the pumps at the water treatment plant struggle to draw in water, Fernández Gallardo said. She touted COMAPA’s purple pipe program, which diverts treated wastewater for outdoor irrigation and industrial use, but said more must be done to conserve and re-use water.

“Without the river, we don’t have the two Laredos,” she said.

Fernández Gallardo said she would like Nuevo Laredo to directly re-use treated wastewater for domestic supply, known as direct potable reuse.

“Treated wastewater is the only water resource whose supply will always go up as the population increases,” she wrote in a statement. “[Direct reuse] would redefine the future of water on the border.”

Another Rio Grande city, El Paso, is rolling out this technology. But Fernández Gallardo knows the municipal administration’s time to execute projects is running out.

Escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico are felt locally. While Mexico increased Rio Grande water deliveries to the United States in the past year, the Trump administration has threatened Mexico with additional tariffs and even sanctions if the nation does not deliver more to Texas. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have attributed the shortfall to the ongoing drought.

The Trump administration quickly replaced several of the U.S. officials essential to the Nuevo Laredo project, including Salazar, the ambassador, and Giner, the well-liked IBWC commissioner.

The Trump administration is also moving forward with plans for a border wall through Laredo, which local organizations, including the Rio Grande International Study Center, oppose.

Water quality woes on the Rio Grande have attracted little national attention. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has pressured Mexico to stop the sewage flows from Tijuana. The EPA has struck agreements with Mexico to accelerate the timeline to repair the Tijuana treatment plant.

A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. and Mexico have “launched a new era of cooperation characterized by swift and decisive actions.”

“No other bilateral relationship has a greater effect on the daily lives of the American people and President Trump and his cabinet are committed to improving the welfare, health, and prosperity of our border communities,” the spokesperson said.

The EPA also funds NADBank’s grants for wastewater infrastructure on the border. Congress has not passed a full federal budget for 2026. Nonetheless, the spending bills for environment and natural resource agencies that passed through committee maintained support for the EPA’s border wastewater programs. The Senate bill would appropriate $36 million and the House bill $45 million for border wastewater projects, comparable to recent years.

CSU’s Mumme said that the Trump administration’s increasing hostility toward Mexico could backfire.

“Trump is used to bullying his way. But that only goes so far,” he said. “Mexico does have leverage.”

Mumme said the history of cooperation shows that the U.S. and Mexico can achieve common goals, on issues from wastewater to water scarcity.

“There’s no substitute to cooperating and finding mutually beneficial solutions,” he said.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), opinion contributor, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/5648553-trump-china-critical-minerals/,"Critical minerals, including the especially important rare earth minerals, are essential to modern life.
Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs” have caused confusion among our allies that have robust critical mineral production — nations like South Korea, Australia and Canada — undermining our ability to work together to undercut the strength of China’s critical mineral supply chains.
The second bipartisan bill I’m working on with Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) would establish a Critical Minerals Security Alliance with America’s global trading partners.
Additionally, this bill would direct future tariff revenue from critical mineral imports into a fund to support member countries’ critical mineral projects.
If we want to stem the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the critical mineral supply chain, we must be smart and strategic about it.","As President Trump returned from his trip to Asia in October, he boasted that his bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping was a “spectacular success.” The reality is, he has little to show for it. After months of recklessly escalating tensions with Communist China, by far the world’s largest supplier of rare earth minerals, Trump’s “art of the deal” only served to clean up messes he created and did virtually nothing to curb China’s influence on the critical mineral supply chain.

We need a new strategy.

Critical minerals, including the especially important rare earth minerals, are essential to modern life. They’re used in everything from smartphones to computers to cars. They are also essential to our national security and are key components in advanced weapons systems, aircrafts and missiles.

In my home state of Nevada, we have enough lithium deposits to power the world with electric batteries for all kinds of vehicles, from semi-trucks to ambulances. Albemarle’s Silver Peak facility in Nevada is currently the only lithium mine in the country. I have worked with presidents of both parties, including Trump, to ensure we are supporting the good-paying jobs and the hardworking families who depend on that mine.

Despite the abundance of some critical minerals in the U.S., we largely rely on China for our supply, as does the rest of the world. China currently owns 60 percent of the world’s production of rare earth minerals and 90 percent of processing capacity. China has repeatedly weaponized its near-monopoly on this technology against other countries, most recently against the United States.

It’s my mission to ensure we’re doing everything in our power to confront this generational economic challenge China poses. Unfortunately, instead of investing in American innovation, creating jobs, and encouraging our allies to decrease global reliance on China, Trump has chosen to impose blanket tariffs on our trading partners and cut key funding to support domestic critical mineral operations.

Trump’s so-called “reciprocal tariffs” have caused confusion among our allies that have robust critical mineral production — nations like South Korea, Australia and Canada — undermining our ability to work together to undercut the strength of China’s critical mineral supply chains. Strategic, targeted tariffs on our adversaries can be good for businesses and for our national security, but this is the opposite of that; it’s chaotic and isolating.

Trump’s blanket tariffs even have a loophole that allow hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian critical minerals like palladium to enter the U.S. without paying a single dollar in tariffs. A strategy that rewards our adversaries and punishes our allies makes no sense.

At the same time, the president has rolled back key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that incentivize investing in domestic critical minerals. When congressional Republicans and Trump passed their billionaire tax giveaway bill, they significantly weakened a key tax cut for Americans who produce critical minerals in the U.S. The administration has also unilaterally revoked funds for American companies that are building our critical mineral supply chain — and creating jobs — in the U.S.

These strategies are misguided at best and irreparably damaging to our global competitiveness at worst. Instead, we should be focused on shoring up the critical mineral supply chain right here in the U.S., and that means investing in both America’s critical minerals and those of our allies so we can better confront China’s economic threat. I’m working on legislation in the Senate to do just that.

My bipartisan bill with Sens. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), the Rare Earth Magnet Security Act, would not only strengthen our domestic supply chain, and therefore our national security, but also support good-paying American jobs. The Mountain Pass mine, which is 15 miles outside Primm, Nevada, employs about 600 Nevadans to mine and process over 15 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals. However, China controls 90 percent of the world’s manufacturing of these materials into rare earth magnets, which we need for our national defense and other essentials. This legislation would create a tax credit for American companies that process these rare earth minerals and manufacture the magnets instead of sending them to China.

The second bipartisan bill I’m working on with Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) would establish a Critical Minerals Security Alliance with America’s global trading partners. The Restoring American Mineral Security Act would exempt nations who are members of this alliance from tariffs on critical minerals and on essential products made from them in return for them imposing tough tariffs on Chinese minerals. That way, we are leveraging our collective market power to ensure subsidized, dirty minerals from China aren’t flooding the world market and undermining American firms. Additionally, this bill would direct future tariff revenue from critical mineral imports into a fund to support member countries’ critical mineral projects.

If we want to stem the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the critical mineral supply chain, we must be smart and strategic about it. We can’t dive headfirst into trade wars, alienate key allies, or take away incentives that strengthen domestic production. We must instead take swift action to protect our own national security, invest in American innovation and jobs, and boost domestic critical mineral production. Passing my legislation will aid in that effort, and now is the time to act. China can afford for us to wait; we can’t.

This article features Government Accountability Project and was originally published here.

Today, Jenner & Block’s bipartisan Congressional Investigations practice, in partnership with the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), released the 2025 edition of When Congress Comes Calling, the gold-standard handbook for the congressional oversight community. This is the first update to the handbook since 2017.

Since the last edition, Congress’s expanded use of congressional oversight authority, its more aggressive oversight of private parties, and the increased media attention surrounding these investigations have drastically reshaped the impact that congressional hearings and investigations can have on the parties being investigated.

In this latest update of When Congress Comes Calling, Jenner’s team provides analyses of recent legal developments and the evolution of investigative practices marking modern congressional investigations. The update also includes key insights from guest editors comprising Democratic and Republican experts across Washington who have held high-level positions across the legislative and executive branches.

Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH), Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary said, “You can’t get to the bottom of any of these investigations unless you have staff who are willing to do the work… we got staff who are now on the other side [of the table], the counsel who make the process work, the folks at Jenner & Block and all of you, all of these good folks…when you bring in the witnesses, you can’t really make the whole process function unless those witnesses have good counsel like we have here…Thank you for the difference you make for the country, for the Constitution, for the Bill of Rights, for the liberties we enjoy as Americans who live in the greatest country ever, thank you for what you do.”

Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology said, “Actually, a majority of the House has served here for less than five years and a lot of members don’t even know what regular order is, so the work that you’re doing…is very important…Because when the House works in its regular order, the work of the people gets done more effectively.”

Ashley Callen, co-chair of the Congressional Investigations Practice at Jenner & Block said, “It was an honor to partner with POGO to update When Congress Comes Calling, and share our bipartisan expertise on how evolving legal and political landscapes are shaping congressional investigations. This edition of When Congress Comes Calling will serve as a go-to guide for congressional investigators for years to come, and we’d like to thank the Project on Government Oversight for entrusting us with the responsibility of updating this seminal publication.”

Tim Stretton, director of the Congressional Oversight Initiative at POGO said, “Thanks to Jenner & Block’s contributions to this publication, future generations of congressional investigators will be well prepared to carry on their essential work. This update honors and revitalizes the expertise of Mort Rosenberg, the original author of When Congress Comes Calling, and ensures that his vision of a robust first branch continues into today’s world. We are grateful for Jenner & Block’s work and look forward to sharing this edition with lawmakers and their staff who are dedicated to conducting rigorous oversight. This updated edition will support POGO’s Congressional Oversight Initiative in training and educating congressional staff about their oversight powers and how to use those powers effectively for years to come.”

“The same communities that were hurt by the decline in coal are now being hurt by the continued reliance on coal.”","Phasing out Kentucky’s reliance on coal-generated electricity by investing in renewable energy and setting fuel-neutral policy could save ratepayers more than $2.6 billion over the next 25 years, according to utility advocates.

A study commissioned by the Kentucky Resources Council, Metropolitan Housing Coalition, Mountain Association and Earthjustice takes aim at a pair of coal-friendly laws the Kentucky General Assembly passed in 2023 and 2024. Those bills, the report said, hinder the Bluegrass State’s ability to transition to using a diverse set of power sources that could reduce electric bills while remaining reliable.

The policies set tougher standards for state regulators to phase out coal-fired units and established a commission to review fossil fuel-fired plant closures, including those that burn coal, oil or natural gas.

The Kentucky legislature’s preference for fossil fuels mirrors that of President Donald Trump’s administration, which has overseen a blanket shift in federal policy against offshore wind-energy production, solar grant funding and environmental justice advocacy.

The Kentucky Resources Council, a nonprofit environmental law and advocacy organization, and its partners are rolling out the research just weeks before lawmakers in Frankfort are set to gavel in a for a budget session where rising living costs are expected to take center stage.

The group said it intends to send a copy to all 138 state senators and representatives.

Modeling in the report shows places that use solar, wind and other renewable energy sources for power outperform coal-fired electricity in cost and risk.

“The least-cost option for Kentucky’s electricity future is one that transitions away from coal and avoids new gas-fired units,” said Ashley Wilmes, executive director of the Kentucky Resources Council, during a Dec. 11 news conference to review the report.

The Republican-controlled legislature in 2023 and again in 2024 abandoned a fuel-neutral regulatory approach that would put rules and even incentives in place based on performance in an effort to reduce carbon emissions and ensure fair competition. Instead, policies criticized by the report hinder utilities from exploring lower-cost renewable alternatives, KRC program attorney Byron Gary said.

Lawmakers created a standard whereby renewable energy is guilty until proven innocent when companies seek the Public Service Commission’s permission to decommission a fossil-fueled power plant, Gary added.

For its part in the approvals process, the PSC is barred from considering intermittent energy resources that include renewables and battery storage when determining what will replace a coal or natural gas plant.

“A guide star for all good law and policy is to be fuel-neutral and be responsive to the facts and the technologies and the economics of the time, and, for the most part, that’s what Kentucky law was trying to do before passage of these fuel-preference bills,” said Cassandra McCrae, a senior attorney at Earthjustice, an environmental law nonprofit and partner organization in commissioning the report.

Baked into the group’s modeling are reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants.

The report insists, however, renewable energies outpace fossil fuels even without factoring in future carbon taxes aiming to put a price on emissions to encourage reduction or fuel-risk costs that include sudden price swings, up or down, due to supply and demand imbalance, policy change, global conflict and other factors.

Fossil fuel-related jobs were excluded from consideration in the review of past utility-related policy, despite their historic importance to the Kentucky economy. The research emphasizes a least-cost alternative for ratepayers first, but there is a great deal of economic opportunity by embracing a renewable energy future, Wilmes said.

In April, Trump signed a suite of executive orders aimed at boosting coal production in Eastern Kentucky and nationwide by easing mining restrictions and reviving coal-company leasing on federal lands.

Similar efforts at undoing Obama-era mining restrictions during Trump’s first term did little to stem a bleeding coal industry giving way to cheaper natural gas alternatives, but it helped secure Appalachian coal country for Trump during the last three presidential elections.

An ongoing global energy transition has already eliminated thousands of high-paying coal jobs, particularly in Eastern Kentucky, where family finances, retail economies and local government financing have been hit hardest, Gary said.

“It’s unfortunate that folks have been left high and dry by that transition, but I think it’s important to recognize also that continuing to rely on coal now hurts the pocketbooks of every Kentuckian,” he said. “The same communities that were hurt by the decline in coal are now being hurt by the continued reliance on coal.”",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/qdfs59/picture223321560/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Paradise%20shutdown,N,,2025-12-15 15:00:46.514072

Why can’t we do it for our clean energy power plants, which are going to be economic engines — even more so, potentially, than the casinos?”","Tribal nations looking to build clean energy projects are exploring new funding pathways after the Trump administration’s cuts to clean energy grants like Solar for All, which earmarked more than $500 million for solar development on tribal lands.

The Tribal Renewable Energy Coalition, an organization of 14 tribes which received a grant for more than $135 million in now-cancelled Solar for All funding, is continuing to use the solar project plans it developed but will seek funding sources like loans and philanthropy, Indigenized Energy CEO Cody Two Bears said during a November press call.

“I think that’s the positive side of what we get out of Solar for All, is we had over a year to plan this out, and now we have some things teed up for tribes to go after and start to leverage some of these dollars,” Two Bears said. “And I think that’s the plan for what we’re going to do moving forward.”

After the Trump administration took office and began to cancel grants associated with the Inflation Reduction Act, “the large utility scale projects that we were working on suddenly became a lot more difficult to finance,” said Chéri Smith, CEO of the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy. “And yet, there are still opportunities there.”

Earlier this year, the alliance launched a suite of project finance and planning tools called the Weaver Platform, and is helping tribes “to use that tool to build their capital stacks,” at the same time that they’re “engaging with networks of investors of all flavors to try and take projects and fund them with private dollars instead of public,” Smith said.

The Trump administration’s grant clawback has rescinded a great deal of federal funding for clean energy from tribes, Smith said, noting that the alliance’s grant-writing team got $484 million in grants awarded to 46 tribes in 2024.

That was “really exciting,” she said, “and the [Indigenous Power & Light Fund] was going to bridge the gap between those dollars and what the full project cost was. Well, 85% to 90% of that has been clawed back.”

Our goal is really simple, that we won’t let any tribal project die on our watch because funding was frozen.

“There is money and there is appetite in the capital markets, but that money comes with a lot of maybe misconceptions or misunderstanding about how tribes work,” she said. “As developers and practitioners, it’s really our job to help demystify that for these markets, so that they feel comfortable investing their money.”

But the appetite for investment exists, Pratte said, as a lot of land in the Great Plains and further west “is under tribal control and tribal authority. So these markets would be remiss if they weren’t looking at how to develop on these lands, and we have to demystify it. We have to make it comfortable.”

“There are so many blank canvases, essentially, from a developer’s point of view in Indian country,” said Todd Halvorsen, head of energy finance and structuring for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy. “The perceived credit risk that’s out there in the finance community is not a real concern, and we should be able to rally enough good folk together to be able to pull the capital required to get these systems built to provide the reliable power, get those projects cash flowing.”

The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy and the Solar Energy Industries Association in October launched a curriculum for clean energy developers and service providers called Pathways To Trust, which “addresses common knowledge gaps that often undermine cross-cultural collaboration and equips participants with practical tools to build mutually beneficial partnerships,” SEIA said in a release.

However, one cultural disconnect between tribes and outside developers — the specifics of law and regulations on tribal land — is also an opportunity for tribes to shape their energy future, said Claudio Clini, a policy analyst with the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, during the November call.

“We’ve been talking to tribes about this idea of replacing federal rollbacks of environmental protections and other things like that with tribal laws and regulations where applicable,” Clini said. “And in this way, we can work towards a self-determined future where tribes are exercising the full strength of their regulatory abilities and jurisdiction.”

Pulling projects back together

The $220 million Tribal Energy Resilience and Sovereignty project, which aims to build a network of nested microgrids in northern California to benefit several tribes, lost an $88 million award through the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience Innovations Program after it was cancelled by the Trump administration.

The microgrids would be backed up by battery and solar to create more reliability for the tribes they serve, who sometimes lose power for up to 20 days in a row, said Halvorsen.

We know the demand for energy is only going to continue in the coming years. Our hunger and appetite for energy is not going away. And in terms of tribal communities, we have to be players in this world.

Founder of Navajo Power

The Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy has been working to help replace the lost federal funding with partnerships, philanthropy and other sources.

“It took about six months to go from hyper-depressed meetings where the vibe was just down, to slowly getting to, ‘Maybe we can do this, maybe we can get this back together,’” said Halvorsen, whose team is coordinating the capital raise and financial structuring for the project. “We’re out there talking with the vast majority of impact investors in the space, and building community — not just among industry in terms of supply chain and development talents, but with the financial communities, whether it be public or private.”

Though tribal nations are working to salvage many of the projects that were in progress, the disruption of suddenly losing funding is significant. Pratte said it has been “truly devastating for many of our communities” to not only lose the project itself but the jobs associated with it.

“It has this ripple effect — the hotels, the construction community, the utilities, all of these things, all of a sudden have the wind knocked out of them,” she said.

“The shift in administration, and policy, has certainly had a profound impact on the tribes,” Smith said. While multiple coalitions are suing the Trump administration over the cancellation of Solar for All funding, the alliance is choosing not to litigate the issue and instead help tribes “preserve the value of the work that they’ve already completed,” she said.

However, Clini said in November that the alliance is continuing to work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to secure a waiver for tribes for the $5 million commercial readiness deposit required for projects to remain in an interconnection queue. The alliance has made the case to FERC that interconnection requests for tribal projects are not made speculatively, and that this deposit is impossible for the majority of tribes to make.

And even before President Donald Trump won reelection and began to rescind IRA funding, the alliance anticipated the potential for this and launched a program called Solar for All TRIBES, “an initiative to try and ensure that the six tribal consortia that received awards don’t lose momentum because of political shifts,” said Smith.

“We’re doing triage on a daily basis with the stalled projects, the stranded engineering work, and we see ourselves as here to protect that progress,” she said. “Our goal is really simple, that we won’t let any tribal project die on our watch because funding was frozen.”

The benefits of alternatives

Halvorsen said he was leery of the potential for issues with Solar for All grants before any of the funding was rescinded.

“I saw a number of flaws and was already thinking, how do we do something better? What’s going to be the replacement program for this?” he said. “I was already worried about unfriendly administration challenges and how some of the funding could get frozen or clawed back.”

He was particularly concerned about the requirement that every Solar for All project had to guarantee a 20% savings on electricity bills for a given end user — a requirement that he says made less sense for projects on tribal land.

Scale is huge in making these projects all pencil, because there’s so many intermediary costs with getting any deployment done in renewables.

Todd Halvorsen

Head of energy finance and structuring for the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy

“Those calculations can be hard enough to pull together to begin with, so there’s a lot of room for challenges,” he said. “And why is 20% savings the most critical thing when there’s all these communities at the end of power lines that don’t have reliable power?”

Halvorsen said he’s seen a mentality shift from grant-funded projects to third-party financed projects, with tribes “retaining ownership from the get go” and being able to leverage the IRA’s direct pay mechanism — which allows tax-exempt tribal nations to still benefit from the legislation’s tax credits — as an underwriting mechanism for “bringing in construction and term financing.”

With many of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits expiring soon as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and tribes being tax-exempt entities, “structuring these things in a way that makes sense for all parties, along with tribal ownership, is really crucial,” Pratte said.

After the passage of the OBBBA, “I think one of the things that we’re beholden to is figuring out where we find that capital, where we continue the good work, because we know the demand for energy is only going to continue in the coming years,” Pratte said. “Our hunger and appetite for energy is not going away. And in terms of tribal communities, we have to be players in this world.”

One of the alliance’s goals is to take “all the good, the bad and the ugly lessons” from the residential and commercial solar industries and apply those on tribal land to “develop, finance, construct and operate projects with tribal developers and tribal asset owners as the core of the projects from the get go,” Halvorsen said.

“The more similar projects you can get per dollar spent, the more efficient the overall program becomes,” he said. “Scale is huge in making these projects all pencil, because there’s so many intermediary costs with getting any deployment done in renewables — whether it’s a single residential project, a hundred residential projects, an 100-kW project or 100-megawatt project.”

As tribal nations have accepted the formalized cancellation of Solar for All and other federal sources of clean energy funding, they’ve been able to pivot to new thinking about how to finance these projects, Halvorsen said.

“Indian country has an aversion to debt, so it’s been the focus that if there’s free money coming from the federal government, let’s go there before we’re thinking about taking on any sort of liability through debt financing,” he said. “But now more increasingly we’re hearing, oh, yeah, we’re doing that in our casino. Why can’t we do it for our clean energy power plants, which are going to be economic engines — even more so, potentially, than the casinos?”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/FCdN9BU0-PM09tnDfF1Z5jki8wMSvHBojO-ksIvl_oE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU4ODk0MzIxXzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:23.190479

With 2025 rapidly coming to a close, we thought this might be the perfect opportunity to look back at the year that was in Texas energy, as well as a lookahead to what 2026 may hold.

Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: I know it’s a thing at year’s end to create top 10 lists. Alas, we don’t have time for 10, so let’s go with three – working up from No. 3 to No. 1.

What do you consider to be the third-biggest energy story for Texas in 2025?

Matt Smith: Oh gosh, I think in the top three, it’s got to be natural gas production and oil production hitting a record.

So with oil, we’re kind of pushing towards nearly 14 million barrels per day here for oil. To put that in context, Saudi Arabia is producing closer to 10 and they’re the second-largest producer. So oil production is going gangbusters and the interesting thing is it has continued to rise. People are expecting it to level off. And it just hasn’t happened yet, but we may see that next year.

We’ve also seen natural gas production hitting a record as well. And so the interesting thing is that even though we may see oil production starting to drop later next year, just because oil prices remain in check, natural gas looks like it’s just going to continue to chug on pushing to record levels.

What about exports?

Exports have hit a record for LNG. So we’ve seen new LNG terminals such as Plaquemines just pushing out a lot of LNG. There’s also the demand for it, right? I think about 70% of it is going to Europe because Europe’s trying to pivot away from Russia.

But on the oil side of things, we haven’t hit a record actually. So Europe has been pulling back a little bit, but we’ve had increasing competition into Europe. But one reason, actually, it’s been lower to Asia is because of tariffs. And so China’s purchasing has basically all but dropped off there.

You know, in any other year that might have been your No. 1, but let’s let’s now shift from No. 3 to No. 2. What’s your second-biggest energy story?

I think we’ve got to go with Texas power, and there’s a few bits here.

So the main one is really just the expectations of AI and data centers there. They’re going to be the largest component driving energy demand growth in Texas in the coming years here.

And you know what? It’s not just that. We’re going be seeing cryptocurrency mining, we’re going see hotter weather, a growing population. And so this is all why ERCOT, the state’s power grid operator, is predicting energy demand in Texas could well get close to doubling by 2030 there. So that’s ripping.

Just one last point on the power side of things, too: Solar is expected to surpass coal-fired power generation on annual basis this year. So it’s looking to account for 14% of power generation in the generation mix there just because it has absolutely ramped up like crazy this year and has overtaken coal.

Another huge story. How do you top those two? What’s your No. 1 pick when it comes to your top energy story for Texas this year?

Well, I think this is kind of timely, and it’s almost like a Christmas present, right? It’s the fact that prices at the pump are getting close to five-year lows here.

So for Texas, we’ve seen prices breaking below $2.50 a gallon there – so multi-year low. And so that gives some money back into our pockets here to be able to have a bit of fun around Christmastime. So I think that’s the winner for this year.

Yeah, this coming at a time when a lot of concerns are growing regarding affordability more broadly, getting to see those prices at the pump going down is a little bit of a bonus there. And obviously a lot of attention focused on what this might mean politically as we go into an election year.

Speaking of 2026, Captain, want to go out on a limb and make any predictions? What’s the next year looking like when it comes to Texas energy?

You nearly stole my thunder there because you were talking about politics.

I think the low prices of the pump are going to be that thing because we’ve got the midterm elections coming up at the end of next year. President Trump is laser-focused on keeping prices at the pump down, not just to give his base some money back into their pockets, but he’s also using it as a lever to try and keep inflation down. So I think we’re going to see even lower prices next year for prices at the pump.

Even lower prices. I don’t know how you can continue to produce as prices continue to fall.

I know, but we’re seeing it come through. Prices are now in the in the 50s for WTI, that U.S. benchmark, and yet oil production continues to chug along. So, higher supply means that the prices should remain in check.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20250423_Monahans_MM045-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:44.011299

A host of U.S. manufacturing expansions are underway, supported by federal and state incentives to bolster domestic production and create local jobs.

Just last week, officials in Alabama, Kentucky and Colorado touted investments from manufacturers in the battery materials, farm equipment, beverage and electronics industries.

Here are more details about those projects.

Coca-Cola bottling partner to invest $475M in Colorado site

Utah-based Swire Coca-Cola, USA plans to build a 620,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Colorado Springs, Colorado, a local chamber of commerce announced Dec. 11.

The facility will produce more than 230 beverage options across more than 60 brands, including soft drinks, waters, teas, juices and sports beverages, according to a news release. It is expected to double Swire Coca-Cola’s local workforce with the creation of 170 jobs, “provide its employees with a modern working environment, meet rising customer demand and advance its sustainability goals.”

“Colorado Springs has been a great partner for our existing distribution facility where we employ 170 people,” Bryan Sink, SVP of supply chain at Swire Coca-Cola, said in a statement. “The city offers a highly skilled workforce and a strong sense of community — all of which make it an ideal location for this strategic investment.”

Officials said the project will support about 1,190 construction and installation jobs, generating an estimated $103 million for workers and families in El Paso County. Swire Coca-Cola is pursuing LEED Gold certification for its facility.

The company plans to break ground on the project next year and consolidate its existing operations into the new facility. It will replace a 90-year-old production plant in Denver, according to the release. Currently, Swire Coca-Cola employs 1,300 people in Colorado.

Foxconn to build first US manufacturing facility in Kentucky

Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Co. will invest $173 million to build its first U.S. manufacturing facility in Louisville, Kentucky, creating 180 jobs, Mayor Craig Greenberg announced Dec. 9.

The 350,000-square-foot “factory of the future” will be outfitted with artificial intelligence and robotics in all phases of consumer electronics production, from design and assembly to logistics, according to a news release. It is part of Foxconn’s “Made in America” initiative, aimed at strengthening the country’s supply chains.

Tenets of Sustainable Industrial Policy Industrial policy can be a powerful tool for Africa’s development, but without the certainty of any specific model to follow, it requires the art of upgrading industrial policy-making itself to be more nimble in a changing world.
The final tenet, capacitated industrial policy-making, forms the foundation of upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making.
Instead, the key to unlocking the gains of industrial policy lies in upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making itself.","As poverty rates have fallen in Asia and elsewhere, Africa accounts for two thirds of the world’s extreme poor although it is home to only 16% of the world’s population. That industrialization is yet to happen in Africa is a major part of the explanation. Though various models—from the 18th-century industrializers to the broad convergence achieved by today’s successful late developers—industrialization has provided a proven pathway to economic transformation and increasing levels of income. It is not any different for Africa: the continent’s route out of poverty lies in achieving sustainable industrialization.

While traditionally associated with manufacturing, contemporary industrialization, however, encompasses a broader concept founded on sustainable productivity growth driven by technological change and innovation. This is in consideration of the compounded interrelationship between the primary sectors—agriculture and natural resources—and services and manufacturing. Hence, the “return of industrial policy” is a nod to this complexity amplified by a changing geopolitical and geoeconomic global order, rapid technological advancements, and a climate emergency. A universal question, then, is not whether to pursue industrial policy, but how.

Drawing upon a 2023 white paper published by the Firoz Laji Institute for Africa at the London School of Economics, The Art of Upgrading Industrial Policymaking Itself, which provides the framework for ongoing country case study research, we outline what the “how” means for African countries. To the extent that there is no single model or “golden policy template” leading to industrialization, what matters is the approach and process, including “experimenting and learning” to craft appropriate interventions by a committed developmental state. This first requires an understanding of the “big five” industrialization issues of today: policy consensus, green industrialization, supply chain security and resiliency, shifting industrialization paradigms, and widening policy space. But most importantly, it requires that industrial policy-making in Africa is itself upgraded to be more adaptive, collaborative, and consultative, while bringing together government, anchor investors, and development partners into a grand bargain for social and environmentally sustainable industrialization.

The Big Five Issues of Industrial Policy-making

First, for industrial policy to succeed, it needs to attract a sufficient level of buy-in or policy consensus. This concerns the political economy of industrial policy and how it is governed. It can entail building a collective strategic vision for industrialization, striking careful bargains with elites, and aligning economic incentives to ensure that the industrial policy—whatever it is—has a deep and sustained commitment to it at the highest levels of government, but also beyond the executive and through the business community to other constituencies and individuals within societies. Challenges to the current model of development in African countries are the distributional struggles and the emergence of stark inequalities. The mining and resource sectors have created islands of wealth, but few jobs. This has left increasing numbers of Africans to resort to the informal sector, and particularly informal and insecure services sector work. As Mazzucato and Rodrik (2023) have noted, welfare orientation is a critical aspect of achieving policy consensus.

Second, with global temperatures already exceeding the Paris Agreement 1.5°C target in 2024, neither a degrowth strategy nor a “grow now and clean later” approach is a viable option for late industrializers. The path is clear, and it is green industrialization. However, as Lebdioui (2024) argues in Survival of the Greenest, what remains less clear is how to balance economic prosperity with the decarbonization agenda. Africa’s historic contributions to CO2 emissions are negligible, but are likely to rise as the continent develops. The challenge is to ensure the emergence of a competitive industrial sector while transitioning to cleaner energy and production methods. This should involve developing Africa’s underutilized renewable energy sources, reducing process emissions in production, and increasing resource efficiency. Green industrialization may also create opportunities as the world transitions to new technologies and patterns of consumption. For Africa, this could include leapfrogging into new and cleaner technologies, encouraging “green mineral” value chains, harnessing green hydrogen, and developing the continent’s sizable but underutilized renewable energy resources. Achieving these goals requires delicate balancing without compromising the just development aspirations of African countries.

Third, the security and resilience of global value chains in the contemporary global landscape are under threat of geoeconomic fragmentation and costly trade diversion. In today’s uncertain geopolitical climate, where “friends” and “enemies” are equally considered targets of protectionism, the risks associated with global supply chains are being recalculated. Instead of getting trampled under foreign giants, African countries must consider how national industrial policies can traverse and circumvent such risks.

Fourth, shifting industrialization paradigms must be taken into account by African countries. The three biggest emerging changes to the current industrial paradigm are the rise of digital production methods, the growth of platform production models, and continuing changes to the geographic distribution of production.

Digitalization is increasing the skills and technology intensity of manufacturing, undermining its traditional developmental role in absorbing large numbers of workers from the countryside. Digitalization also creates opportunities that could be seized, including new possibilities for late industrializers like African countries to leapfrog into new ways of producing, including the increased role of digital services in manufacturing, many of which can be outsourced.

The two other factors that define industrial paradigms include the organizational model of production, currently characterized by network production and platform production, and the geographic scope of industrialization, currently dominated by value chains at regional as well as global levels. These developments come with opportunities and challenges that African countries must factor into the design and implementation of industrial policy. For instance, regional or global value chain systems entail specializing in specific tasks but require efficient transport, information and communication technology, and energy infrastructure as the price of entry.

Finally, the “return of industrial policy” brought with it widened policy space. The expansion of the acceptability of industrial policy measures is an opportunity for African countries as late industrializers. While this opens the door to more adventurous industrial policies, it calls for a rethinking of the multilateral rules-based system to respond to this changed reality.

Tenets of Sustainable Industrial Policy

Industrial policy can be a powerful tool for Africa’s development, but without the certainty of any specific model to follow, it requires the art of upgrading industrial policy-making itself to be more nimble in a changing world. The following five tenets outline the foundations of a more sustainable, active, and intentional industrial policy-making process.

The first tenet, adaptive industrial policy-making, positions experimentation and learning at the centre of economic transformation. It appreciates that industrialization must occur in a new, unsettled era of challenges and opportunities, including “greening” industrialization, the reprioritization of supply chain security, and shifting industrialization paradigms. Rather than “perfecting” industrial policy design, an adaptive approach prioritizes systematic implementation through dedicated “policy-testing” zones or “sandboxes,” such as Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and pilot industrial parks. However, the process does not stop here. A complementary policy learning ecosystem allows for a rigorous assessment of outcomes and policy refinement. Doing so allows governments to build capacity by delivering results and to focus more on implementation (which is generally appreciated to be a greater challenge in many African countries) instead of getting caught up in perfecting policy design.

Secondly, upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making requires a consultative approach for developing iterative dialogue channels to leverage synergies between stakeholders in the public, private, and third sectors, both local and international. What Peter Evans (1995) calls embedded autonomy is the outcome of an approach that preserves the ability of a state to protect its autonomy from capture by competing interests. The key is to leverage stakeholder relationships to understand how industrial paradigms are shifting and where opportunities can be created.

The third tenet, partnering for industrial policy-making, builds network capital that enhances the credibility of the industrialization agenda and garners a crowd-in effect of investment opportunities. However, gathering investments is not enough; the destination of the investment matters. For instance, most investment flows in Africa are concentrated in primary extractive activities, such as mining and energy. While partners can help shift this dynamic toward a mutually beneficial relationship, the onus is on African policy-makers to negotiate and realign partners’ interests toward supporting their own sustainable industrialization agenda.

Partnerships between international and domestic agents are not limited to investments, but are central to a transboundary industrial policy-making approach, the fourth tenet. We live in an interconnected world where the consequences of an event in one part of the world—geopolitical rivalries, supply chain disruptions, ecological catastrophes, and viruses—are felt in another. Some of the opportunities for African industrialization are also transboundary, including the potential to create scale economies and tap into rapid market growth through African regional integration. But the influence of individual African countries and their technical capacities in transboundary issues can be limited.

To use the language of the African Union’s Agenda 2063, African countries must “speak with one voice and act collectively to promote our common interests and positions in the international arena.” By pooling their resources and influence, African countries can better ensure that their interests are heard and accounted for in global issues. The African Continental Free Trade Area can be a powerful resource not just for integrating African economies, but for establishing commonalities on tricky issues being negotiated in multilateral fora.

What all four tenets have in common is the demand for building greater capacity to shape industrial policy-making that is adaptive, consultative, partner-based, and transboundary. The final tenet, capacitated industrial policy-making, forms the foundation of upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making. It refers to the need for effective and well-resourced public institutions for policy development and implementation. Such capacity provides governments with agency to steer the national industrialization agenda, building upon local expertise and knowledge. Well-capacitated institutions facilitate the effective brokering of different interests not only to ensure implementation remains on track, but also to navigate regional and international partnerships to achieve mutually beneficial transboundary goals.

Conclusion

The framework we have outlined provides a basis for putting industrial policy-making practice on a sustainable, adaptive, and experiment-based trajectory. We recognize that the framework assumes a rigorous and deliberate decision-making process across the design, implementation, and monitoring of industrial policies. In practice, however, policy-making is often reactive, rather than adaptive. Nonetheless, navigating today’s complexity to achieve sustainable economic transformation and overcome pervasive poverty requires more than tinkering with industrial policy instruments. Instead, the key to unlocking the gains of industrial policy lies in upgrading the practice of industrial policy-making itself. While no “golden template” exists, our framework serves as a starting point for a universal approach for rethinking the design, implementation, and monitoring of industrial strategies. With capacitated industrial policy-making as a foundation, the process must be adaptive, consultative, and transboundary to address the challenges of a sustainable future.",https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-12/office-paperwork-team-meeting.jpg?itok=LdAaD0ur,N,,2025-12-15 13:59:58.442579

Developments in charging infrastructure, energy integration, and digital connectivity float amid a constant current of changing regulatory frameworks, market dynamics, and competitive pressures. This Insight examines the current outlook for the US EV market, ongoing changes to federal and state regulatory policy, critical infrastructure and cybersecurity challenges, and the broader trajectory of the industry going forward.

Market Trends and Projections

Since 2020, EV sales have surged from just over 500,000 to 1.6 million in 2024. As 2025 draws to a close, the US EV market has remained on a strong upward trend, with a projected 2.25 million sales projected by year’s end. While this past October saw sales dip following the expiration of federal tax credits, quarterly growth remains robust, with Q3 2025 sales up 40% year-over-year. Analysts expect this slowdown to be temporary, with long-term demand being supported by resilient consumer interest and innovation.

Retail forecasts also reflect this optimism. EVs are expected to account for 9.1% of total vehicle sales in 2025, with projections indicating it could rise to 11.8% in 2026 and 26% by 2030. This growth is largely driven by expanding model availability, improved battery technology, and increasing public awareness. Despite policy and infrastructure hurdles, the market outlook remains positive, signaling a steady shift toward electrification in the years to come.

Federal and State Policy Dynamics

Despite favorable market conditions, regulatory and policy developments are exerting increasing pressure on the EV sector’s future. In addition to the expiration of Individual Retirement Account tax credits that reduced consumer incentives, updates to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program have introduced stricter requirements around community engagement and cybersecurity. These changes reflect a shift toward more localized and accountable infrastructure planning, while adding complexity for developers and manufacturers.

The US administration has also recently initiated a rollback of federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards by proposing to revert to the 2022 baseline, which would require only minimal annual efficiency increases. While this shift may ease compliance burdens in the near term, it also creates uncertainty for manufacturers planning future vehicle lineups. Companies will likely be faced with complex strategic decisions as international and more stringent US regulatory pathways diverge.

State-level actions are influencing market dynamics as well. California’s authority to set stricter emissions standards was revoked earlier this year, and federal waivers originally issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for zero-emission truck mandates have been rescinded. While these rollbacks may slow progress for medium- and heavy-duty electrification, California and 10 other supporting states have filed suit in federal court in California challenging those recissions.

Evolving trade policies have added another layer of challenge. Tariffs on key components such as semiconductors and industrial machinery are prompting a reevaluation of automotive supply chains, pushing manufacturers to invest in regional production hubs to avoid dependence on importing.

Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Challenges

Charging infrastructure remains a critical barrier to widespread EV adoption. Although there are currently over 76,000 public station locations and 228,000 charging ports across the United States, access is still uneven, especially in rural areas. Permitting delays, interconnection issues, and high installation costs continue to slow progress. To support the projected 33 million EVs on the road by 2030, the United States will need to scale up to 2.2 million public charging ports, which will require coordinated investment and significant policy support.

High-capacity chargers can place significant strain on local utilities, with some expected to require energy loads comparable to large outdoor sports stadiums by 2030. Utilities are also being forced to navigate complex pricing models that can deter investment.

Meanwhile, the lack of unified cybersecurity standards leaves EV infrastructure vulnerable to digital threats. While the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued guidance, comprehensive regulations are still in development.

Strategic Outlook

As the EV ecosystem matures, stakeholders face emerging market opportunities. Vehicle-to-grid technology introduces significant potential for market access and monetization. Bidirectional charging enables EV owners and fleet operators to participate in energy markets, creating new revenue streams through load management and grid services. For fleets, aggregated energy capacity offers particularly strong prospects for capturing value previously inaccessible.

However, these opportunities come with legal and operational considerations. These include compliance with market participation rules, whether retail or wholesale, and the need for robust energy services management between operators, owners, and charge point operators. Currently, no comprehensive regulation governs cybersecurity requirements for the full EV infrastructure, although frameworks such as NIST guidance and procurement language from the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation provide some initial direction. Proactive engagement with evolving standards and contractual provisions will be critical to securing competitive advantage in the EV industry.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/transportation/158987992_automotive-report-2025_largetile.jpg?rev=4483a57ee98e41888216a4d37cf0ae79&hash=09B6B70D6750559C843D25B95BBED71F,N,,2025-12-15 12:04:12.912716

DALLAS, TEXAS (December 15, 2025) – U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced over $351 million in funding for the city of Fort Worth, Texas. The funds include an approved loan of $347 million from the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program and selection of Fort Worth to receive $4,817,344 million from the Solid Waste Infrastructure for Recycling (SWIFR) grant program.

Fort Worth’s WIFIA loan will be used to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment and support beneficial water reuse. A newly designed and built water reclamation facility will meet the needs of a growing population while treating wastewater to be reused for industrial and irrigation purposes. The SWIFR grant will help launch the Reuse Program and Recycling Enhancement Project to collect appliances, building materials, furniture, and electronics for reuse at drop-off locations.

“Fort Worth’s growth has made it a premier destination in Texas for families and businesses, and has created a greater need for clean water infrastructure and materials management services,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “Funding from EPA can help this great city increase capacity to meet those needs and continue the historic pace of growth.”

“Fort Worth is committed to making smart, future-focused investments that keep our city strong and affordable for the families and businesses who call it home,” said Mayor Mattie Parker. “The EPA’s WIFIA loan for the Mary’s Creek Water Reclamation Facility allows us to stretch every dollar by securing low interest rates and flexible repayment terms. The solid waste grant helps us expand the reuse and recycling services our community relies on. Together, these investments are a major win for our wastewater and solid waste ratepayers and reinforce our commitment to delivering high-quality, cost-effective services as Fort Worth continues to grow.”

The WIFIA program aims to accelerate investment in the nation’s water infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost supplemental credit assistance for regionally and nationally significant projects. Through its flexible financing features and competitive interest rates, WIFIA helps communities save money. By pairing the WIFIA program’s federal funding with state, local, and private investment, EPA accelerates water infrastructure investment worth billions of dollars.

The WIFIA program’s rolling selection process allows a wide variety of borrowers from across the country to access WIFIA financing. For example, in the last round of funding, the WIFIA program selected two private entities and five small communities to submit loan applications. To date, EPA’s WIFIA program has announced $22 billion to help finance over 140 projects across the country. These projects are creating over 160,000 jobs across the country.

EPA’s SWIFR program provides grants to improve post-consumer materials management and infrastructure; support improvements to local post-consumer materials management and recycling programs; and assist local waste management authorities in making improvements to local waste management systems. This initiative supports economic development in communities across the nation.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:04:16.291528

The majority of respondents are optimistic about long-term careers in renewables, but a significant portion considered exiting the industry in the last year.

The “2025 Salary & Sentiments Report” was build on responses from more than 500 professionals and captures how shifting market conditions are influencing both talent expectations and employer decision-making during a year described in the foreword as a “moment of recalibration,” shaped by policy uncertainty, slower capital deployment and lengthened development timelines.

“Transparency isn’t a nice-to-have anymore — it’s essential,” said Mindy Prefling, partner at root/edge. “Professionals want clarity about their value, their opportunities, and the future of the industry. Employers want the insight to make smarter, more sustainable hiring decisions. This report reflects what we hear every day from both sides, and partnering with WRISE allows us to deliver that data at scale.”

Key findings from the 2025 Salary & Sentiments Report:

Long-term confidence remains high. 67% of respondents report feeling optimistic about long-term careers in renewables, with only 6% identifying as pessimistic.

Market uncertainty is influencing mobility. While 68% intend to remain in the sector, 39% considered leaving the industry within the past year, reflecting concerns around tax credit proposals and long-term stability.

Compensation growth continues but has moderated. Median salaries across most levels remain stable, and 84% of professionals receive a bonus, typically tied to company or individual performance.

Gender gaps persist in development planning. Women are significantly less likely to have a formal development plan despite reporting similar levels of career confidence.

Professionals want meaningful progression. Many require double-digit salary increases to consider a move, and most rate structured development plans as important to their long-term goals.

“The data shows a sector full of committed, capable people, but also one that needs clarity to navigate the next chapter,” added Prefling. “We hope this report helps employers build stronger teams and helps professionals make informed decisions in a rapidly changing landscape.”

Doseke Akporiaye, executive director at WRISE, commented on the launch of the report: “I am excited by this partnership with root/edge and to share this important report. In the 20 years since WRISE was founded, the state of women in the industry has changed dramatically, but we still have work to do. Working with root/edge on this report is a strategic first step towards data leadership for women in the industry. We hope our members and sponsors will continue to support these efforts to tell the story of women’s experiences through data.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hardhat-construction-worker.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:03:13.234950

An incentive for home solar The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.
Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush.
Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
A rush on solar Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.","On their small farm in Wahoo, Nebraska, Rhonda McClure and her husband toss a few pumpkins over the fence to a flock of ewes. They sell market lambs and wool, some of which Rhonda uses as a fiber artist, along with garden produce and compost.

She said they’ve always tried to use sustainable practices on their farm, including rotational grazing, geothermal energy and most recently — solar.

“The solar just fits in with trying to be as independent and careful of the environment as we can,” McClure said.

For the McClures, harnessing energy from the sun allows them to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and keep their energy costs down over the long run.

A solar array they added in 2021 to help power their well and home reduced their summer energy bills from several hundred dollars per month to as low as $4, McClure said.

They added a solar battery this spring to release energy at night and act as a back-up during regional power outages.

“It’s provided a good deal of security for us to know that if we’re off grid for a while, if something happens, we can get by,” McClure said. “We have water and heat and the essential services here, for us and our livestock.”

Now they’re wrapping up another solar project, largely to provide air conditioning for a new outbuilding used to store and process wool, teach classes and host large groups of people.

McClure said they likely would have waited to install it next spring. But they bumped up the timeline when they found out the Residential Clean Energy Credit was rapidly expiring. Congress voted this summer to eliminate it at the end of 2025 through the One Big Beautiful Bill.

An incentive for home solar

The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush. But the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden kicked the deadline to 2032 for the full credit, followed by a rate phase down.

The Biden administration said the tax credit and two dozen others in the Inflation Reduction Act would “save families money on their energy bills and accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.”

Over 752,000 households claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their 2023 taxes. Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit made solar more affordable for homeowners by lowering the upfront costs and shortening the amount of time before they recoup their initial investment, said Paul Cutting.

Cutting helps homeowners identify opportunities to improve their energy efficiency and pay for them as an energy auditor with Clean Energy Districts of Iowa. The affiliation includes 15 county-level organizations across eastern Iowa and one in Wisconsin.

The cost of installing solar depends largely on the size of the home, along with its location and overall electricity usage, Cutting said. The national average is $23,500, according to the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy, but some industry experts say some residential solar projects can exceed $40,000.

“The solar tax credit being funded at the full 30% makes it pretty enticing for a homeowner to move forward with that,” Cutting said.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill cut the tax credit deadline off at the end of the year instead of its original phase out starting in 2032. Homeowners working with contractors must have their systems installed and invoices paid by Dec. 31 to qualify.

A rush on solar

Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.

That was the experience of StraightUp Solar, a company that designs and installs solar systems for homes, businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Missouri and Illinois.

“We sold out in September, and many other solar companies were selling out in July, which means their entire build schedule was full for 2025 because people wanted to get in before the tax credit expired at the end of the year,” said Eric Schneider, director of business development for StraightUp Solar.

The company’s third quarter of 2025 was the second busiest for inquiries, said Schneider. The biggest spike was in 2022 when homeowners expected an earlier tax credit to sunset before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We call it the ‘solar coaster’ in the industry because demand fluctuates up and down,” Schneider said. “Some of it's policy driven; some of it's interest rate driven.”

More utilities are also shifting to “time-of-use” or “time-of-day” pricing, which sets higher electricity rates during peak hours, typically late afternoon and evening on weekdays.

A homeowner with solar panels and a battery back-up can draw from their stored energy – rather than the grid – during peak hours to save money, Schneider said.

These customers are also insulated from future energy rate hikes, said Corey Ziemann, solar program coordinator for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association.

“If you're buying solar, you're essentially buying all the energy you're going to use from that system all at once. You're locking in that rate so you won't be subject to the increases that are coming,” Ziemann said.

The loss of the federal tax credit will likely stretch out the payback period for homeowners, Ziemann said. But another way to help make home solar more affordable is through “group buy” programs, which bring individuals from a community together to purchase in bulk.

The Midwest Renewable Energy Association’s Grow Solar team has facilitated more than 70 group buy programs in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri.

3M in 2023 agreed to pay $10.3 billion to settle lawsuits from hundreds of public water systems contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

Allentown stands to get more than $2.6 million from the Minnesota-based industrial giant.

That money represents just two of 10 expected payments for Allentown, according to a memo from Mayor Matt Tuerk’s office to City Council.

Annual payments are scheduled to continue through 2033, the memo states.

And DuPont, now known as Chemours/Corteva, will pay the city almost a half-million as part of a similar settlement.

Council this month introduced a measure to accept the money. Members are likely to pass that bill at their next meeting Wednesday.

New treatment facility in the works

The funding is earmarked to help pay for a $20 million facility to treat water from Crystal Spring, one of Allentown’s four major water sources, according to Tuerk’s memo.

Sampling results from the spring exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s strict limits for PFAS in drinking water — four parts per trillion.

One part per trillion is equivalent to one drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

The Lehigh County Authority said its tests found 3.1-4.6 parts per trillion of perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) in Allentown’s water, as well as up to 3.1 parts per trillion of perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA).

The same forever chemicals — and three others — were detected in drinking water in the LCA’s Central Lehigh Division, according to the authority.

The Lehigh County Authority’s draft five-year capital plan for 2026-30 says the organization’s “next step is to design and construct a treatment facility for Crystal Spring.”

The project should be done by the end of 2027, according to the draft plan.

Weisbart Springer is a firm of 10 lawyers that specializes in complex litigation as well as sensitive problems, according to its website.
At the time of the engagement, Paxton’s office was dealing with two bombshell lawsuits involving high-ranking lawyers who were once aligned as members of his leadership team.
That hourly rate is on the low end of outside contracts from Paxton’s office.","Days after a simmering office dispute involving his current and former deputies splashed into public view, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office hired an Austin firm that touted its expertise in “fixing sensitive problems.”

Weisbart Springer Storm Hatchitt LLP’s June 30 contract called for it to advise on “development and compliance with OAG policies and procedures,” according to a copy of the agreement obtained by Bloomberg Law through a public records request. For the next two months, Paxton’s office paid it more than $25,000.

Unlike seven other contracts Paxton’s office engaged in with outside counsel this year, the contract didn’t provide specific expectations, name an opposing party, or describe a dispute. The invoices show work on litigation that wasn’t laid out in the engagement, and the tasks are heavily redacted in invoices provided to Bloomberg Law.

Paxton’s office didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment on the firm’s retention. Weisbart Springer didn’t respond to questions about the work it did.

Weisbart Springer is a firm of 10 lawyers that specializes in complex litigation as well as sensitive problems, according to its website. Its attorneys “have successfully extricated individuals and companies from seemingly impossible situations, restored the status quo, and helped to allow individuals to move past traumatic business and personal chapters of their lives,” the site says.

At the time of the engagement, Paxton’s office was dealing with two bombshell lawsuits involving high-ranking lawyers who were once aligned as members of his leadership team. One was a claim by former solicitor general Judd Stone that Paxton’s first assistant, Brent Webster, had slandered him.

In the other, an executive assistant asserted she’d been harassed by Stone and former division head Christopher Hilton while the three of them prepared to defend Paxton in his 2023 impeachment trial in the Texas Senate. The lawsuit included an email from Webster that said he had been threatened by Stone to the point that he was considering security for his family based on comments Stone made.

In their lawsuit, Stone and Hilton said Webster retaliated against them by feeding the email to the assistant to use in hers. Webster did this, they allege, because they launched a corruption investigation into him through a public records request to the AG’s office. Separately, Stone and Hilton made a complaint to the state bar the same week also accusing Webster of using taxpayer money to fund his legal fees in a federal criminal bribery investigation into Paxton and tampering with witnesses in Paxton’s impeachment trial. Neither Paxton nor Webster was charged in the criminal probe.

Weisbart Springer’s legal work isn’t disclosed in either of the cases’ court filings. Its connection to the Stone-Webster feud is revealed through a pay invoice that showed a paralegal reviewed complaints in the cases. Otherwise, it’s impossible to decipher what the firm did for most of the 50 hours it billed.

Some references are general, broadly revealing preparation and discussions with counsel. One says partner Julie Springer gave “advice regarding litigation.” Another says Springer reviewed an opinion from Paxton’s Open Records Division “to understand same and” before the rest of the entry is redacted.

The invoices are titled “Attorney General/Investigation.”

In all, the firm billed the state $25,824 for two months of work ending in late August.

Transparency

The contract’s instruction to help develop policies “could mean anything so therefore it means nothing at all,” said Joseph Larsen, board member of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, who noted that it’s impossible to tell from the engagement what the firm was hired to do.

Larsen, of Gregor Wynne Arney, is one of three lawyers who specialize in Texas government ethics and transparency who said they are struck by the lack of specificity in the contract, which called for the firm’s attorneys to bill $525 per hour. That hourly rate is on the low end of outside contracts from Paxton’s office. Some pay up to $3,780 in contingency for taking on and beating major pharmaceutical and technology companies.

In addition to not responding to requests for comment, Paxton’s office declined to provide a copy of its policy on contracting with outside law firms citing confidential internal communications between agency attorneys.

“Policies are not normally attorney-client privileged,” Larsen said. “They’re super public.”

The contract “would be better from a policy standpoint if it were more specific,” said James Hemphill, an open government lawyer with Graves Dougherty Hearon & Moody.

Springer, who signed the contract on behalf of the firm, has ties to Paxton going back for more than a decade: In 2014, she served on his transition team when he was first elected attorney general after contributing $5,000 to his campaign.

In addition to Springer, Geoff Weisbart, another partner, performed legal services as part of the contract. The attorneys were assisted by Jan Blair, a paralegal who billed $225 an hour.

On Aug. 27, Blair spent a half hour to “research and review litigation pleadings” to prepare materials for Springer’s review—though Springer never billed for the review of those materials. The case isn’t specified.

It was the final entry from the firm before the contract ended a few days later on Aug. 31.

“It feels weird that the statement invoice of what was being paid for is vastly different than what was put on the description of legal services,” said Andrew Cates, an ethics attorney in Texas. “Somebody should answer for why those are so different.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/a5df7fc/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2F89%2F1d5ea5744eed811798b67158f622%2Fgettyimages-460704473.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 13:01:53.805779

The electrification mandate will only worsen the state’s punishing housing crisis, said Michael Fazio, executive director of the New York State Builders Association.
The Climate Act mandated that by 2035 the state should have nine gigawatts of offshore wind.
The Department of the Interior is “halting future offshore wind lease sales,” Secretary Doug Burgum announced in July.
The state needs to meet the Climate Act deadlines unless the Legislature amends the law, state Supreme Court Justice Julian Schreibman ruled in October.","New York’s sweeping 2019 Climate Act set strict mandates for shifting away from fossil fuels to more “clean energy” sources. But with progress stagnating and consumers bearing more costs, it’s increasingly harder to ignore the gap between policy ambition and the state’s ability to deliver.

The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act established into law a series of priority requirements:

Greenhouse gas emissions in the state need to be reduced 40% by 2030 and 85% by 2050 relative to 1990 levels.

The state’s electric system should use 70% renewable power by 2030, and be 100% clean energy in 2040.

The “beauty and the beast” of the Climate Act is that while it sets strict mandates, it does not lay out how to meet them, said Vincent M. Nolette, who maintains a tracker of the state’s progress on climate action for Columbia Law School.

A year after the legislation passed, the state formed the Climate Action Council, whose 22 members included energy sector experts, state officials and other stakeholders who were tasked with mapping out a plan on how to meet the law’s directives.

But some say the state never fully considered the cost of implementing the law or what it would take to meet the decarbonization requirements.

“There was no fiscal (analysis) and there was no statement of how effective this will be, it was just like we have a crisis,” said Ron Epstein, a former executive deputy commissioner at the state Department of Transportation.

Epstein agreed climate change is a “crisis,” but he said the plan was never studied for its financial effects on New Yorkers.

“To be determined” is what’s listed under the “fiscal implications” section of the law on the New York Senate’s website.

National Grid customers pay an extra 9.5% on their electric bills to fund components of the law, according to a recent state Department of Public Service report. But more than $8 billion in transmission projects to connect renewable energy development to the grid has yet to be added to New Yorkers’ electric bills.

There have been areas of success toward meeting clean energy and emission reduction requirements, but overall the state is far behind. The Department of Public Service’s report also found the renewable energy requirement won’t be met until at least 2033, three years after the law requires.

New York’s grid is also dirtier today than it was when the law passed. That can be largely attributed to former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s decision to close Indian Point, a nuclear power plant in Westchester County.

Even though certain sectors like electricity and large industry have seen emissions declines, there’s only been about a 9% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions relative to 1990 levels, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

All-electric buildings

Buildings make up 31% of the state’s fossil fuel emissions, more than any other sector. The Legislature passed a law requiring new homes be built without fossil fuel appliances starting next year and, in 2029, it will apply to all new buildings.

But when those rules will go into effect remains unclear because the state abruptly agreed to pause implementation of the policy until a legal challenge brought by home builders and labor unions is resolved. Attorneys for the state had been defending the mandates in legal disputes until Hochul publicly said she was open to delaying the electric building requirements, which critics contend will drive up construction costs and contribute to the housing shortage.

Fossil fuel opponents counter electrified homes will not only be better for the environment but also cheaper in the long run. The policy is critical to moving the state off natural gas for home heating. Instead, electric homes utilize heat pumps, which extract warmth from cool outside air. More than 22,000 heat pumps were installed in homes and businesses across the state last year.

The electrification mandate will only worsen the state’s punishing housing crisis, said Michael Fazio, executive director of the New York State Builders Association. It will cost around $5,000 more to build an average-sized home in Albany County that is in compliance with the new rules, according to data from a state study and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Those homes would have lower energy bills, but it will take around 11 years for those savings to catch up with the additional construction costs.

A group of 19 Assembly Democrats signed onto a petition calling for the rules to be delayed “pending thorough reassessment of grid reliability, cost impacts and risk mitigation.”

Assemblyman William Conrad III, who drafted the petition, said he’s worried about grid reliability as large electric users like AI data centers and Micron’s chip fab plants expand in western New York.

Solar on every roof

The Climate Act requires the installation of six gigawatts of rooftop and small-scale solar by the end of this year, enough to power roughly 1 million homes. The state reached that goal a year early and is anticipating more than 10 gigawatts being online by the end of the decade.

Incentives, funded in part by fees on New Yorkers’ utility bills, cover a large share of the cost to install solar on rooftops. Low- to middle-income New Yorkers can get more assistance to cover the upfront cost of rooftop solar. Growth may slow as a federal tax credit covering up to 30% of a system’s cost is scheduled to end this year as a result of the Republican-led Big Beautiful Bill Act.

New York is a national leader in community solar projects, with three times more installed than any other state. The arrays take up less than 100 acres, with nearby homes and businesses getting the biggest share of the electricity produced. Larger solar projects are sited at the state level, limiting the role local governments and residents have in their construction.

Matthew Antonio, director of National Grid’s transmission control center, said the proliferation of small-scale solar projects “has made our hot days a little bit easier to manage.”

The same progress hasn’t been made in building up large-scale wind and solar power projects.

New York is 19th in wind and solar energy capacity, despite seeing above-average growth over the last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

New York has 20 times the population of South Dakota but produces about the same amount of wind and solar power.

Cost can be a huge factor.

Because other states are usually sunnier and windier than New York, more renewable energy can be produced at the same upfront cost, thus lowering the eventual amount paid by residents.

Build it offshore

New York’s Atlantic Ocean shoreline makes the state an optimal place to build up offshore wind. The slow rollout of those resources is indicative of the unending setbacks to the Climate Act. Wind blows much faster over the ocean’s surface than over land, meaning those facilities more often produce at maximum capacity.

The Climate Act mandated that by 2035 the state should have nine gigawatts of offshore wind. About 1% of that goal is in service.

When former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo signed the mandates into law, he concurrently announced two offshore wind projects off the coast of Long Island. When completed, Empire Wind One and Sunrise Wind are expected to provide nearly two gigawatts of electricity. Cuomo promised they would be in place by 2024, but they’re both delayed three years.

In May, Hochul fought a federal halt on the Empire Wind One project, allowing it to continue construction. Offshore wind development relies on federal approval because it’s built in federal waters.

It may be a challenge for New York to make further progress on the offshore wind mandate as President Donald J. Trump’s administration has questioned the ability of those projects to provide energy versus the costs associated with fossil fuels.

The Department of the Interior is “halting future offshore wind lease sales,” Secretary Doug Burgum announced in July.

Burgum said he’s also examining more than 3.5 million acres offshore that were designated as pre-approved wind development zones under President Joe Biden’s administration.

The industry was suffering before Trump took office. In 2024, developers canceled another offshore project near Long Island, citing inflation, high interest rates and supply chain issues. After a decade of declining prices thanks to low interest rates, the cost of offshore wind projects increased 40% to 60% between 2020 and 2024, the consulting firm McKinsey reported last year.

Yet to launch

Implementing a cap-and-invest program where large manufacturing and fossil fuel power plants pay to emit greenhouse gases is a core component of achieving the 2019 law’s mandates. About 30% of payments are then given back to New Yorkers in rebates.

The rest goes toward investments to “support the transition to a less carbon-intensive economy,” according to the Department of Environmental Conservation.

Hochul directed state agencies in early 2023 to develop the program to “create a cleaner, greener future while helping New Yorkers with the costs of the transition.”

The rules were completed by state agency staff early this year but never released, Politico reported.

Without guaranteed revenue from cap-and-invest, the Climate Act is an “unfunded mandate,” Donohue said.

And for Hochul, the risk of implementing the measures under the timeline set in the law is too likely to increase living costs for New Yorkers.

Low-income New Yorkers would see a small savings from the program, while costs would rise for middle-income residents, according to state research on cap-and-invest.

But the state’s cap-and-invest study doesn’t “include estimates of the program’s full fiscal and economic impacts,” wrote the Citizens Budget Commission, a New York-based nonpartisan think tank.

“It’s going to make businesses less likely to do business here, or to create jobs or to expand here,” state Senate Minority Leader Robert G. Ortt said.

Delaying implementation may be out of Hochul’s control. The state needs to meet the Climate Act deadlines unless the Legislature amends the law, state Supreme Court Justice Julian Schreibman ruled in October.

Schreibman gave the state Department of Environmental Conservation until February to release its rules to bring down carbon emissions.

Hochul signaled the state will appeal the ruling while she works with the Legislature to amend the Climate Law and push back the mandates.

‘Guinea pig’

By 2035, all newly purchased passenger vehicles in the state are required to be electric. And the state’s roughly 45,000 school buses need to be zero-emission by the same deadline.

About 10% of new car purchases in New York are electric. That’s about half the rate of California.

So far, New York has 229 electric school buses in operation, with about 800 more on the way, according to the Electric School Bus Initiative. Purchasing enough buses for the mandate will cost more than $9 billion, according to the Empire Center, an Albany-based research organization. Incentive programs will cover 10% of that added cost, the center said.

Almost half of school districts told the state Education Department they need to make significant upgrades to their local electric system to support electric bus charging. Electric buses are up to two-and-a-half times more expensive than fossil fuel alternatives, the Education Department reported last year.

Electrifying the state’s school bus fleet would have the greenhouse gas reduction effect of taking 180,000 cars off the road, according to state estimates. Exposure to diesel exhaust, which the vast majority of school buses emit, leads to asthma and respiratory illnesses, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Why are we making our school districts and local property taxpayers be the guinea pig for this social experiment,” state Assemblyman Philip A. Palmesano said of the school bus mandate.",https://www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-15-at-9.19.17-AM.png,N,,2025-12-15 11:02:29.825179

The DRIVE35 (Driving Research and Investment in Vehicle Electrification) Business Case seeks final approval to launch a £2 billion programme over 5 years from the financial year 2025 to 2026 to the financial year 2029 to 2030. It seeks to transform the UK’s zero emission vehicle (ZEV) manufacturing and supply chain. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) delivers this programme through formal grant funding agreements (GFAs) with the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) and Innovate UK (IUK).

Following approval of the DRIVE35 Business Case, a further £500 million was allocated to support ZEV research and development (R&D) as part of the Industrial Strategy and Advanced Manufacturing Sector Plan. This funding is considered part of the DRIVE35 Programme, bringing the total Capital Departmental Expenditure Level (CDEL) funding allocated to DRIVE35 to £2.5 billion.

DRIVE35 is structured around 3 coherent and modular pillars, each designed to funnel innovation into the others:

innovation pillar: seeks to distribute R&D grants to develop strategically important zero-emission vehicle technologies, bringing new systems and prototypes to technology readiness

scale-up pillar: aims to distribute R&D grants to fast-track near-commercial pilots for zero-emission vehicle technologies, enabling manufacturing and market readiness

transformation pillar: looks to distribute capital grants to drive the industrialisation of an electrified automotive sector in the UK, from vehicle plants to their supply chains

1.1 Programme objectives

The DRIVE35 programme objectives are to:

substantially increase inward investments into the UK automotive sector

secure and create high-quality jobs in the UK automotive industry

deliver significant emission reductions, meeting the government’s climate obligations

strengthen supply chain resilience, anchoring future vehicle assembly

help achieve the required battery manufacturing capacity

enable a decade of R&D investment in UK automotive

DRIVE35 will provide a simpler, faster, and more effective government offer to investors, building on the track record from previous APC and Automotive Transformation Fund (ATF) programmes and competitions. The delivery model is a consortium arrangement between APC, IUK, and DBT, ensuring value for money, operational efficiency and continuity in delivery, building upon industry confidence and ensuring a smooth transition to the new programme.

As outlined in the Business Case, DRIVE35 requires £2.04 billion in capital and R&D funding, alongside required resource funding. The programme has robust governance, risk management, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements in place. Total funding, as announced in the Industrial Strategy, is £2.5 billion through to 2035, however this document summarises the programme’s original full Business Case.

2. Strategic case

DRIVE35 is designed to secure the UK’s position as a global leader in ZEV manufacturing and supply chains. The programme addresses the need for the UK automotive sector to strengthen its competitiveness amid rapid technological change, global competition, and ambitious climate targets.

This is an essential part of the actions that government will deploy to increase the volume of vehicles made in the UK to over 1.3 million cars and commercial vehicles by 2035, as set out in the UK’s Industrial Strategy.

DRIVE35 fundamentally reviews, streamlines and consolidates previous support into 3 coherent pillars:

innovation pillar

scale-up pillar

transformation pillar

This maximises impact and bridges the gap between innovation and industrialisation. DRIVE35 aims to:

increase inward investment

create and secure high-quality jobs

deliver significant emission reductions

strengthen supply chain resilience

support long-term R&D investment

2.1 Strategic alignment

DRIVE35 aligns with government missions to:

kickstart economic growth, by supporting jobs and productivity growth

make Britain a clean energy superpower, by accelerating ZEVs and battery manufacturing

DRIVE35 is integral to the UK’s Industrial Strategy, helping to drive increased electric vehicle (EV) supply chain manufacturing, anchor future vehicle assembly and battery manufacturing in the UK, and ensuring the UK remains at the forefront of automotive innovation, electrification and sustainability.

Investment under DRIVE35 will help achieve our ambitions to nearly double the annual business investment in the UK advanced manufacturing from £21 billion to £39 billion in 2035, driving growth across our economy. ​DRIVE35 will help achieve the Industrial Strategy ambition to increase the volume of vehicles made in the UK to over 1.3 million cars by 2035.

DRIVE35 will work alongside the National Wealth Fund (NWF), who have a mandate to invest £27.8 billion in sectors aligned to the Industrial Strategy, including automotive. Together, DRIVE35 and the NWF represent a complementary and multi-layered offer to investors, combining grants and other policy instruments from the government with a suite of financial products, to increase support across the EV supply chain.

3. Economic case

The economic rationale for DRIVE35 is based on correcting market failures such as:

high entry cost

technology lock-in

co-ordination failures

the need for greater R&D investment

The programme was appraised against a range of options, with the preferred approach being a backloaded funding profile that aligns support with industry demand and minimises underspend.

DRIVE35 is forecast to:

leverage £6.6 billion in private investment

support over 50,000 jobs

cut up to 10.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e) in the UK

The programme is expected to deliver a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of 4.8, representing high value for money. Additional benefits include enhanced battery manufacturing capacity, reduced dependence on overseas supply chains, and regional economic growth.

3.1 Summary of the analysis of different options

The DRIVE35 Business Case considered a range of options for government intervention in the UK automotive sector, including:

‘do nothing’

extending existing programmes

several configurations of the new DRIVE35 programme

Each option was assessed for its ability to address market failures, deliver value for money, and achieve strategic objectives.

3.2 Shortlist of options

The final shortlist included:

Option 1: only committed spend to 2025 (baseline – do nothing)

Option 3b: DRIVE35 programme with backloaded funding (preferred)

Option 3c: DRIVE35 programme with a flat funding profile

Option 4c: DRIVE35 with a flat profile, extending the £2.04 billion capital and R&D budgets to 2035

3.3 Type of economic appraisal used

The department used social cost-benefit analysis to appraise the options. This approach quantified both the costs and the monetised benefits of each option, including employment and R&D spillovers to assess overall value for money.

3.4 Costs, benefits, and risks of shortlisted options

All shortlisted options assumed a total nominal cost of £2.04 billion (capital and R&D).

The preferred option (3b, backloaded DRIVE35) had a discounted net present social value (NPSV) of £6.1 billion and a BCR of 4.8, representing very high value for money. Other options had slightly lower BCRs and NPSVs but followed similar spending profiles.

Risks included the potential for underspend if funding was not aligned with industry demand, and the risk that insufficient intervention would lead to loss of competitiveness, jobs, and investment in the UK sector.

3.5 Rationale for the choice of preferred option

Option 3b (DRIVE35 with backloaded funding) was chosen because it:

best aligns funding with forecast industry demand

minimises the risk of underspend

maximises the opportunity for programme benefits to be realised

It also scored highest against critical success factors such as:

strategic fit

ability to address market failures

value for money

deliverability

4. Commercial case

The commercial case for DRIVE35 looked at the options available to deliver the programme from maintaining the existing model, in-housing, or through to outsourcing.

The 5 options that were considered are:

Option A: consortium with DBT: IUK and APC reappointed to work alongside DBT

Option B: consortium with DBT: new delivery partners

Option C: fully outsource to IUK and APC

Option D: fully outsource to new delivery partners

Option E: un-house delivery using DBT resource

Each option (A to E) was assessed against the criteria that were developed in alignment with the recommendations from the Cabinet Office’s Sourcing Playbook, and ranked as high, medium, or low alignment.

The options were assessed against:

value for money

operational efficiency and mobilisation

proven success and experience

technical and sector expertise

industry confidence and familiarity

separation of key functions

Option A, which maintained existing arrangements, scored highest and was identified as the preferred delivery model. This option ensures operational efficiency, continuity, technical expertise, and strong industry relationships which IUK and APC are uniquely positioned to leverage. This is complemented by policy direction from the DBT Automotive Unit, alongside grant management expertise and oversight from the DBT Grant Delivery Directorate.

The preferred approach offers strong value for money, operational efficiency, and proven delivery capability. This is because:

as a non-profit organisation, APC operates on a not-for-profit basis – this ensures cost-effectiveness compared to commercial alternatives, which would likely incur higher costs

operationally, the existing arrangement enables immediate mobilisation, building on established structures, teams, and roles already in place – this continuity avoids the delays and disruption that would result from onboarding new delivery partners and provides familiarity for applicants and stakeholders

the current delivery consortium has a decade-long track record of success, having supported over 58,000 jobs and delivered significant carbon dioxide (CO₂) savings – working with government, this delivery consortium has leveraged over £6 billion in private investment, demonstrating its effectiveness in catalysing industry engagement

this delivery model ensured a clear separation of responsibilities between APC, IUK, and DBT.

From a legal and procurement perspective, this arrangement is structured as a grant funding agreement (GFA), not a contract for services, and is therefore not subject to public procurement regulations.

The commercial case also addresses how the delivery model will be implemented, and considers:

payment mechanisms

contract management

intellectual property

diversity and inclusion

sustainability

transformation of undertakings, protection of employment (TUPE)

modern slavery

The case notes that there will likely be ad hoc delivery requirements that are only anticipated to arise when required or at specific points in the programme lifecycle.

These could include:

professional services

research

monitoring and evaluation services

Such services will be procured as and when required through standard competitive tendering processes in line with the applicable procurement regulations and DBT commercial policy.

5. Finance case

As per the original Business Case, the financial plan for DRIVE35 requests £2.04 billion in CDEL funding over 5 years, plus required Resource Departmental Expenditure Limits (RDEL) funding. Of the total CDEL allocation, 75% is allocated to capital grants (transformation), and 25% to R&D grants (innovation and scale-up).

The spending profile is designed to flexibly respond to forecast industry demand. It reflects the appetite across both the UK and global markets, as demonstrated through previous APC and ATF legacy competitions.

R&D funding will be delivered through GFA with APC and IUK, with robust financial controls, risk management, and assurance processes in place. Capital funding is delivered directly from DBT. The plan is designed to be flexible and responsive to market conditions, with regular reviews and adjustments as needed.

5.1 Financial assumptions

The financial assumptions for DRIVE35 set out how funding will be managed, classified, and controlled throughout the programme. Transformation grants will use CDEL funding, while innovation grants and tech scale-ups will use R&D CDEL funding, each disbursed under the relevant spending powers.

Each sub-programme will run several funding competitions, with application windows to help manage resources and budget. The plan assumes the programme ends in 2030, with grant payments subject to HM Treasury (HMT) approval.

6. Management case

6.1 Programme structure and governance

DRIVE35 is part of the Government Major Project Portfolio (GMPP). The delivery of DRIVE35 is organised around 3 main pillars:

innovation pillar

scale-up pillar

transformation pillar

These are managed concurrently under the oversight of a central Programme Governance Board, the DRIVE35 Strategic Board. The DBT Automotive Unit leads the programme, supported by the Grant Delivery Team, sector analysis, and external delivery partners, namely the APC and IUK.

The governance structure is multi-layered. At the top is the DRIVE35 Strategic Board, which is chaired by the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO). This board is supported by a Monitoring and Evaluation Governance Board and 2 sub-programme Delivery Boards.

Delivery consortia for each funding stream are also established, ensuring that operational and strategic oversight is maintained throughout the programme’s lifecycle. Escalation routes are defined, allowing issues to be raised from project level up to ministerial level as required.

The programme’s success is dependent on several factors. These include timely approval and budget confirmation from HMT, effective collaboration with delivery partners, alignment with other government programmes and regulatory frameworks, and the availability of skilled staff and resources within both DBT and its partners.

6.2 Approach to risk management summary

Risk management for DRIVE35 is systematic and embedded in programme delivery. All risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies are recorded in a central risks, actions, issues and decisions (RAID) log, which is reviewed monthly for each programme in meetings with delivery partners.

Risks are assessed using DBT’s 5-point scale for probability and impact and are categorised by proximity. Ownership of risks is assigned to the most appropriate delivery partner or DBT function, and escalation routes are in place for risks that fall outside of tolerance to ensure appropriate actions are taken and mitigations applied.

6.3 Evaluation plan summary

The DRIVE35 M&E plan sets out a clear framework for systematically measuring the progress of DRIVE35. It is designed to produce evidence on the effectiveness of the programme’s delivery, and the extent to which the programme is on track to deliver its intended outcomes and value for money.

The DRIVE35 M&E plan is expected to deliver:

a comprehensive evaluation framework, setting out the future process and impact evaluations

a baseline exercise, aiming to collect data on the automotive sector prior to the launch of DRIVE35

Want to know where the job growth of the future is headed in the state of Washington? Look no further than the latest data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Several smaller counties in the interior and eastern portions of the state experienced solid growth too: Benton County grew by 8.3%, Klickitat County grew by 7.9%, and Franklin County grew by 7.7%. All three border the Columbia River at or near the Oregon state line.

According to the Washington Office of Financial Management, about 82% of Washington’s population growth from 2023 to 2024 came from people moving to the state. A separate study by U-Haul showed that as well, with the cities of Spokane, Tukwila and Tacoma all ranking among U-Haul’s top growth destinations in 2024.

Tukwila placed No. 8, Tacoma No. 17 and Spokane No. 24 on U-Haul’s annual ranking of the fastest-growing destinations for movers in the U.S. Lower cost of living, access to abundant outdoor recreational opportunities and more affordable housing were cited as factors drawing people to these growing cities.

“People are seeking cheaper options for land and housing. They want decent property taxes. The views of Mount Rainier here are the best you will find in all of Washington, and we are very strong on personal property rights.”

— Richard Foster, Director of Economic Development, Klickitat County, Washington

Come for the Bargain, Stay for the Views

Richard Foster, economic development director for Klickitat County in south central Washington, says folks relocate to his county of 24,161 people for several reasons: “People are seeking cheaper options for land and housing. They want decent property taxes. The views of Mount Rainier here are the best you will find in all of Washington; and we are very strong on personal property rights.”

Besides government jobs, manufacturing and agriculture comprise the top employers. “We are the size of Rhode Island in square miles,” he says, “but we are a very rural frontier county. We have only 470 unemployed people out of a labor base of 9,154.”

The future, he says, is energy. An Energy Overlay Zone for green hydrogen is the biggest project on the drawing board. A venture of California-based RIC Energy, it is called H2Klick and promises to be a source of hydrogen, methanol, wind, solar and energy storage on 2,194 acres. The $1 billion capital investment creates 200 jobs in construction.

Two other mega-projects loom on the horizon: Savion Energy plans to build a $1 billion project for solar and wind power generation on 8,075 acres in the far eastern portion of Klickitat County, while the Goldendale Energy Storage Project is slated to be a $3.3 billion pumped energy storage endeavor, the largest on the West Coast.

“Pumped storage is water that is pumped uphill,” says Foster. “The system lets the water run downhill, and energy is captured from that process. Surplus power on the grid is used to pump that water back uphill. That will produce about 1 GW of energy. The battery project will be another 1 GW.”

Foster estimates that $5 billion in capital investment is going on across the county, but that number could increase in a hurry if a prospective data center developer decides to move forward with a 2-GW digital infrastructure campus on the energy storage site.

High-Tech Work with a Side of Fries

Just to the east of Klickitat lies Benton County, part of the Tri-Cities Region anchored by the fast-growing communities of Kennewick, Richland and Pasco. Adam Fyall, sustainable development manager for the Benton County Commissioners’ Office, says that agriculture and related industries are the main economic drivers in this county of 219,999 people.

“Most French fries in the U.S. come out of this area,” says Fyall. “That has been a good baseline employer over the years. We also have the legacy of the Hanford Site, which was part of the original Manhattan Project during World War II.”

Hanford is the decommissioned nuclear production complex in Benton County. “A large piece of land is available there,” says Fyall. “That has driven a lot of energy R&D. That sector has really caught fire here over the last 20 years.”

High-tech jobs are attracting talent from all over the country, he adds. “In the 30 years I have been here, the population of this area has more or less doubled. Most residents of Benton County were not born here. The 80 years of the Hanford Site have generated its own legacy workforce, and those are very high-skilled folks.”

Fyall says the county currently is in talks with a nuclear technology startup out of California. “They are looking at the Tri-Cities area and North Carolina,” says Fyall. “They are in California now, but they don’t feel like that is the best place for them.”

Benton also boasts the only commercial nuclear generating power plant in the Pacific Northwest — a 1,200-MW facility. “Emerging nuclear energy generation is very much on our radar,” he adds. “We also have hydroelectric power from a dam that is half in Benton County and half in Oregon.”

Fyall says people move to Benton for a variety of reasons: “The California exodus is driven by people getting priced out of the state,” he says. “The political environment also drives them to move to places like Washington and Idaho. Where we are, there has been a prevailing pro-growth mindset. Redeveloping the Hanford Site has become a driver. And our climate is different here. It is a little drier. We are colder in the winter and warmer in the summer. People like that. From Boise to Salt Lake City to eastern Washington, the whole Intermountain West is growing and is very attractive to new residents.”",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-12-15 15:01:22.189235

But that's all reportedly about to go out the window. This week, EU officials, under immense pressure from the auto industry, are expected to unveil a new set of standards that take the gas-car ban off the table. Is this a moment of relief for the car business, or a chance to double down on 20th-century technology while rivals from China only get faster and better?

25%: What Happens If The EU Backs Off The Gas-Car Ban

EU regulators have sought to end internal-combustion new cars on the continent as part of an ambitious effort to fight climate change. But automakers have long complained that switching to battery-powered and software-driven cars before buyers were “ready” would effectively destroy the continent’s most important manufacturing sector.

No country beat this drum louder than Germany, home to Europe’s largest auto industry, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week called the move a win: “We need to correct the conditions in Europe as quickly as possible so that this industry in Europe has a future,” he said at a press briefing.

But what kind of future? Europe’s problem is that China’s automakers aren’t just beating down its door, but have already moved into some of the rooms and invited their friends. Chinese brands—typically with EVs and hybrids—are stealing sales from local automakers, and increasingly setting up European factories as well.

So one expert who spoke to Bloomberg asked: if a change in regulations allows European automakers to double down on ICE, what guarantee exists that they’ll have the technology to compete with China?

While the breathing room might be welcome for an industry that accounts for about €1 trillion ($1.2 trillion) of economic output, it also harbors risks. Too much flexibility threatens to slow development and increase the technology gap with Tesla Inc. and Chinese rivals such as BYD Co. That could result in the EU becoming a bastion for yesterday’s technology and doing little to bolster the sector’s flagging competitiveness.

“What’s happening now is a wake up call for the industry,” said Jos Delbeke, professor at the European University Institute in Florence and a former senior EU climate official. “Some flexibility may be needed for all good reasons, but it should be temporary; otherwise we will risk missing the climate targets and losing the technology race.”

There are some upsides to the EU’s change of plans, Bloomberg reports. Incentives will be expanded, especially for small cars made in the region. And the automakers could be on the hook for a 90% reduction in CO2 emissions for their fleets from 2035 onward—still a steep and ambitious target.

But if automakers got regulators to blink once, they may be able to do it again. And that’s bad news for the climate, for technological competitiveness, and ultimately for jobs as well.

50%: America’s Looser Fuel Economy Rules Probably Won’t Save Us Money

Gas Prices

When it comes to going back to gasoline, America has looked at the rest of the world and said, “Hold my beer.” Not only has the Trump administration axed EV tax credits and Biden-era rules driving a more electric market, it recently announced a cut to fuel economy standards—ostensibly, to make new cars cheaper.

But an Automotive News analysis shows that even if new car prices go down by a whopping $900 or so, as the White House has predicted, whatever savings drivers get will be erased by paying more at the pump:

But if the proposal becomes official, companies will ditch fuel-saving technologies and consumers will pay at least $187 more over the lifetime of the vehicle, even with the expected price savings upfront, according to an appendix to NHTSA’s proposal.

The net cost of passenger car and light truck ownership will increase by between $187 and $506 over the vehicle lifetime, driven by a total increase in fuel costs of $1,112 to $1,431 for the 2031 model year, NHTSA said.

When asked about the net losses for individual consumers, a NHTSA spokesperson, Sean Rushton, said the agency’s analysis “does not factor in how the Trump Administration has already saved the American people millions at the pump by unleashing domestic oil production to record highs” and that the Biden administration “jacked up car prices with their illegal EV mandate and anti-energy agenda.”

The NHTSA calculus assumes fuel prices will “generally remain around” $3 to $3.20 per gallon through 2050. It also figures prices will dip below $3 per gallon in 2028.

The Trump administration has blamed the strain of fuel economy regulations and the push to EVs for soaring new-car prices. But as that Automotive News story notes, even federal regulators can’t completely back up that idea. That story is worth a read in full.

75%: BYD Is Moving On Up, Because It Has To

Fangchengbao Bao 5

Chinese automaker BYD has proven this year that it’s going to be a force to be reckoned with in the auto industry for a long time. But even it’s got some growing pains. Its sales are slowing down, primarily at home in China, where competition is fierce and the market is cooling off after years of unprecedented growth.

So if you can’t win on volume, you win on profit margins. That’s why BYD is betting big on its two new upmarket brands: Denza and Fangchengbao. The former is a kind of high-performance Porsche competitor (not to be confused with BYD’s Yangwang, which is doing similar stuff) and the other is an off-road-focused luxury competitor to Land Rover. Here’s more from Nikkei Asia:

The off-road-oriented Fangchengbao began delivering vehicles to customers in November 2023 and plans to expand its lineup to include a sedan in 2026. BYD positions it as an unconventional brand, appealing to a niche not covered by the company's mass-market autos like the Ocean and Dynasty series.

The Bao series of plug-in hybrid off-road vehicles tout high performance even on rough terrain. The Tai series, designed for both off-road and urban driving, debuted this year.

The Tai 7 is a plug-in hybrid, like the Bao 5, and comparable in size. The model has less power and acceleration than the Bao 5, and its exterior design is simple and geared toward city driving. But its price starts at 179,800 yuan ($25,500), 60,000 yuan cheaper than the Bao 5.

The Tai 7 sold about 20,000 units in October, helping lift Fangchengbao's sales that month to 31,052 vehicles, a roughly 400% year-on-year increase. The Tai 7 became Fangchengbao's biggest hit to date.

""We currently have a six- to eight-week waiting period for delivery, so we're going to increase production capacity to meet demand,"" Xiong Tianbo, Fangchengbao's general manager, told Chinese media.

It may just work. BYD is a smart company when it comes to product planning, branching out into electric kei cars in Japan and plug-in hybrid estate wagons in Europe. It has a penchant for figuring out what buyers want. Now, will they bite outside of China?

Look, I wouldn't exactly kick and scream if you dropped a vintage Porsche 911 into my garage tomorrow.

But beyond that, I've been driving and testing EVs long enough that I have zero interest in buying a new gas car ever again. I'm pretty much done and happy with that. What about you? Are any of these regulatory moves enough to entice you back to a gas car, or are you staying flexible? Let us know in the comments.

Several state supreme court justices who participated in the program sat down with brief interviews with State Court Report, which we are publishing as a series.

North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs has served on the North Carolina Supreme Court since 2023. She was appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper (D), who had previously named her to the state’s Court of Appeals in 2022. Prior to serving on the bench, Riggs was a prominent civil rights lawyer focusing on voting rights. In 2024, Riggs’s election win to keep her seat on the state high court received national attention after her opponent refused to concede, despite multiple recounts confirming his loss, and tried to have legally cast votes throw out. It took six months and battles in both state and federal court for her race to be confirmed.

In her interview, Riggs spoke about the drawbacks of partisan judicial races, new challenges created by artificial intelligence (AI), and how she models the behavior she’d like to see on the bench.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

When you were in law school, what did you expect your legal career to look like?

I applied to law school thinking I’d be an environmental lawyer. I have a degree in microbiology and a master’s degree in the history of science, and it seemed like a natural progression for someone interested in the sciences. But by the end of law school, I knew I was going to focus on civil rights.

It wasn’t until I was practicing that I realized the significance of the temperament and character and values of the judges I was appearing before — and even more significantly, what that meant for my clients and how they understood the justice system. It was like, “Oh, that is another level at which I can use this degree to do some good someday!” But I didn’t have it on my bingo card for 2022. I got married in 2021 and thought I would just keep doing the job that I enjoyed doing and enjoy my personal life. I’ve campaigned with people who knew they wanted to be a judge from very early on; I had about 80 different iterations of what I wanted to be before I finally landed there.

What advice do you wish someone had given you when you were a law student?

I wish I’d been pressed harder to clerk. I spent a lot of time in law school doing direct client work with a clinic, helping people apply for clemency to have their civil rights restored in Florida. I enjoyed that client work so much that it was all I could think about. The idea of sitting quietly and doing a lot of research and writing was not particularly appealing to me at that stage in my life. But it was an opportunity I should have availed myself of before practice sweeps you up and you’re on a steep learning curve. That quiet time will never come back.

I was lucky that my practice early on was fairly generalist. That’s also something that clerking can give you — that sense of seeing a wide range of what the practice looks like. It helps you make better decisions that are better fits for you. It’s beneficial to you have that generalist experience in clerking, that quiet time early in your career to focus on learning the doctrine and thinking about how decisions are made.

What challenges do students face today that are different from your experience?

I can’t imagine what it’s like to go through law school with AI. It would feel intimidating to get an education in a time when it seems like a lot of information is being generated that way.

Also, folks who are graduating now feel like they’re entering an uncertain job market. I graduated in 2009, on the tail end of the recession. The legal job market had crashed. It didn’t think it was going to directly impact me, although it had such domino effects that there was no one who left school then who didn’t feel the impact. Obviously, student debt was bad then, but it’s worse now.

What do you enjoy about being a state court judge?

I am at a stage in life where I like sitting quietly and reading and thinking — it feels luxurious, especially coming off a campaign. I also really enjoy trying to model the behavior I wanted to see from people on the bench when I was litigating. We frequently have attorneys before us who are arguing for the first time. I was in their shoes not all that long ago, and I was front of judges who were gruff and unkind and unnecessarily brusque, and it didn’t have to be that way. It also didn’t build my client’s confidence. So, I smile at every person who steps up to the podium, even if I do look a little bit discordant compared to my colleagues.

The first time I argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, I stood up to the podium and I was a little nervous and Justice [Elena] Kagan gave me a gentle smile. It wasn’t inappropriate, it wasn’t over the top, but it was, in that moment, incredibly meaningful to me because I saw it as a non-verbal, “I see you. You’ve worked hard to get here. Make your best argument. I’m interested to hear what you have to say.” And that made me a better advocate in the moment. It stuck with me. I had ample experience by then, and yet it was a bit of a unique experience. And then you start to think, “Wait, why is this such a unique experienced?” So, getting to sit in those rarefied spaces, I can help make that change. When it comes to the folks who come before my court — no matter what their arguments are, no matter how I ultimately rule — I have the ability to convey through my words and my actions on the bench that I’m interested in what they have to say, that I know that they’ve worked hard to get there and that their clients have put a lot of faith in them to make this argument. It is part of what I want to see more of in the legal practice, so to be able to model it is rewarding and enjoyable.

What is something people might not know about your state constitution?

In the U.S. Constitution, you have the Bill of Rights appended to the end of the Constitution, whereas ours (and this isn’t uncommon), precedes the constitution. To me that matters — structurally, visually, in all the ways. Before we talk about the three branches of government, we talk about popular sovereignty and that power is in the hands of the people. That the guiding document begins with a recognition of the rights of people of the state is a way for me to remember why I’m here and why I am doing this. It’s the lens through which everything that comes after it is filtered.

What are opinions you’ve participated in that are the most memorable to you?

The first time I felt the full import of work that I was doing was while I was still a judge on the Court of Appeals. The North Carolina legislature had unanimously passed a statute to allow victims of child sex abuse to bring claims after the expiration of the statute of limitations, in the light of the understandable delayed disclosure of many victims. It’s a very politically charged issue. Parts of the bar were very opposed to it and parts were very in favor of it. I was on a panel and wrote a bipartisan decision upholding the Safe Child Act as a constitutional exercise of the legislature’s power in recognition of the unique circumstances of the childhood victims of these egregious practices and behaviors. I got to talk about the statutes of limitations and procedural hurdles and was really proud to do that. And it was unanimously upheld by the North Carolina Supreme Court.

Then, when I was on the supreme court, I wrote a dissent in a case where Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was seeking to take his name off the ballot in the 2024 election. It was, of course, an election law case. I had represented voters in voting rights litigation for so long, and my clients would have never succeeded in convincing a court to force a board of elections to incur millions of dollars to change the ballots and election procedures on the eve of an election — which was, essentially, what Kennedy was doing. My dissent is strongly worded because I felt I had a unique voice to describe the inconsistency of what my court did in ordering all these ballots to be reprinted at the cost of county boards of elections right before the election. I wanted folks to understand what an outlier that decision was. If different people receive a different measure of justice, it matters.

What are some challenges facing state courts?

For North Carolina, in particular, two things come to mind. One is the way we elect judges. Just having lived through that, it’s hard to reconcile with what we typically think of judges, which is that they are not your typical politicians. But the campaign finance issues and the partisan nature of these races — there’s always going to be something about that that’s a little bit off for me. I didn’t make the rules, and nobody asks me for policy advice, though I’d be willing to talk to any policymaker about my experience.

Regardless of their political affiliation, I think it ought to trouble everyone that partisan elections make it really hard to inspire faith and independence in the judiciary. People just see it as politics as usual. Plus, we are living in a time, certainly in North Carolina, when norms and traditions are eroding and our jurisprudence is changing rapidly in short time. That’s just really hard to navigate.

What is your response when people say courts are too politicized?

I remind people that these are decisions that the legislature gets to make. In North Carolina, we used to have nonpartisan judicial elections. We used to do public financing of judicial elections. But I play with the hand dealt to me. That’s the best that I can do. I serve all the people of North Carolina regardless of their registration or voting histories.

Europe’s wind industry continues to drive economic growth, energy security and employment. The European Wind Energy Workforce Report, published today, sees employment in wind growing from 443,000 jobs today to over 600,000 by 2030. The report has granular data on current employment levels and vacancies, and the most sought-after profiles and the skills required in the wind industry. It highlights the importance of the right vocational training and shows Europe needs a more strategic approach to workforce planning.

Wind energy is cementing its position as a pillar of Europe’s economy. Wind is more than clean, secure and home-grown electricity. It’s a major source of high-value jobs and industrial growth. That’s the main finding of Europe’s Wind Energy Workforce Report which WindEurope published today.

Europe’s wind energy industry today supports 443,000 jobs. 211,000 of those are direct jobs, spanning from wind farm development to manufacturing, installation, operation and decommissioning. Onshore wind remains the largest employer, but offshore wind is gaining ground, now accounting for 20% of direct jobs.

Employment in wind is set to steadily increase over the remainder of the decade. By 2030 the sector will provide 607,000 jobs. This assumes that Europe installs on average 30 GW annually over 2025-2030, in line with the latest WindEurope 2030 Outlook.

Wind energy has a truly European manufacturing footprint. Nearly half of all the direct jobs in wind are in manufacturing. Europe has more than 250 factories producing wind turbines and equipment for the grid connections. Over the last two years the industry has invested more than €14bn in new or expanded factories, some of which are portrayed in our Wind Works for Europe video series.

Wind energy expansion remains below target

Employment in wind could be growing even faster. But Europe is not building enough wind energy to meet its energy security and climate targets. As it stands the EU will have 344 GW of wind energy by 2030, well short of its 425 GW target. Persistent bottlenecks to a faster expansion of wind include cumbersome permitting, the insufficient build-out of electricity grids, the slow uptake of electrification and poor national auction design.

Wind jobs growing steadily, potential skills shortage too

The European wind sector faces serious skills shortages. Europe’s Wind Energy Workforce Report identifies 235 job profiles across the wind farm lifecycle and highlights critical gaps. Most urgently, 7,000 blade technicians, 6,500 field engineers and 5,000 pre-assembly technicians are needed before 2030. Addressing these skills shortages is essential for Europe to meet its wind energy ambitions.

This will require a more strategic approach to workforce planning. WindEurope’s new report can help here. It offers real-life data to help identify priority roles at every stage of the wind supply chain. Policymakers must endeavour to scale up training programmes for key roles. They must encourage retraining workers from other sectors. They should harmonise certifications and enable EU-wide skills mobility. And they should promote diversity in technical and leadership roles to ensure a sufficiently big talent pool.

8 out of 10 critical roles where we see the largest shortage will rely on Vocational Education and Training (VET). Europe has to give more visibility to these career paths and increase their attractiveness.

What is the industry doing about it?

Europe’s wind energy workforce is getting ready to power the continent’s energy transition. With the right investment in skills and collaboration, the sector will continue to deliver jobs, innovation, and climate solutions for all Europeans.

On December 5, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) internally circulated a memorandum — which has leaked to the public — that reorients civil enforcement activities around a single guiding principle: “Compliance First.” This shift, at least as outlined in the memorandum signed by Acting Assistant Administrator Craig J. Pritzlaff, signals a deliberate move away from enforcement strategies that prioritize punitive measures or expansive interpretations of regulatory authority in favor of efforts which promote achieving timely, efficient, and legally defensible compliance.

The Policy’s Core Commitments

Since the January inauguration, the Trump Administration has stated a continuing commitment toward EPA’s traditional mission of protecting human health and the environment, including emergency response efforts. (For more, see here.) In the Trump Administration’s view, however, recent years have seen EPA stray from traditional tools to achieve these ends. The new policy memo expresses a desire to achieve better cooperation with partners (including states and even industry) and to achieve compliance without distracting from other priorities like rebooting American manufacturing or restoring “dominance” in the energy space. (See “Pillar 2” here.)

The “Compliance First” memorandum centers around the question of “how can compliance be achieved in the most efficient and quickest means possible?” In EPA’s view, past enforcement postures sometimes prolonged negotiations, allowed evidence to go stale, or imposed remedies beyond statutory requirements.

Under the newly announced framework:

Compliance is the North Star: EPA wants enforcement to resolve violations quickly and bring entities into compliance, not drag out negotiations or impose broad remedies.

Legal Precision Matters: Findings and injunctive relief must reflect the “best reading” of the law with substantially less tolerance for creative interpretations. (Note, “best readings” of statutory authority square with the recent Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo – for more, see here.)

Collaboration is In: EPA is placing a greater emphasis on state coordination, open communication, and voluntary compliance tools, suggesting a more cooperative posture.

Broad Remedies Are Out: The memo rescinds 2021 guidance on expansive injunctive relief and bans supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) until further notice.

LEAPS is the New Lens: Enforcement decisions will be judged against five factors — Law, Evidence, Analysis, Programmatic impact, and Stakeholder impact. (We break further down “LEAPS” below.)

This philosophy announced in “Compliance First” essentially builds out Administrator Zeldin’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative, which frames environmental protection and economic growth as mutually reinforcing goals.

Six Pillars of the Compliance First Mandate

EPA distills the framework into six operational factors:

Compliance Assistance Toolkit. Enforcement will not be the only tool. Expect greater emphasis on proactive outreach, technical assistance, and voluntary programs like self-reporting and audits.

State Partner Coordination. Cooperative federalism is back in focus. EPA states it will act on a “clear federal interest,” coordinate closely with authorized states, and avoid duplicative actions, aiming for consistency in compliance determinations and to strengthen capacity.

Open Communication. Transparency is key. EPA commits to a “no surprises” approach, maintaining dialogue with Tribes, states, and regulated entities throughout inspections and enforcement to accelerate compliance.

Findings of Violation. Gone are the days of expansive interpretations. Findings must be “clear and unambiguous,” tailored, and based on the “best reading” of applicable law, with careful attention to canons, past practice, and live litigation. According to the memo, ambiguities will be elevated for national-level resolution to ensure consistency rather than resolved ad hoc. (Note: This approach has precedent outside of the Trump Administration; as discussed here, the Biden Administration EPA took a similar approach to “environmental justice” enforcement.)

Compliance Requirements and Injunctive Relief. Expect to see more quick and concise remedies. The memo advises that when formal enforcement is necessary, remedies must be tailored, be aimed at achieving compliance swiftly, and rest squarely within clear statutory or regulatory authority. The memo rescinds the 2021 guidance promoting broad injunctive tools and SEPs. Until further notice, SEPs are off the table.

Reasoned Decision-Making. Enter the LEAPS framework, described as a structured approach to ensure enforcement decisions are rational, transparent, and defensible.

Decoding the New Code Word: LEAPS

The memo touts the “LEAPS framework” as providing a disciplined lens for evaluating enforcement decisions. The “LEAPS” acronym breaks down as follows:

Law. Anchor every decision in the clearest, most defensible interpretation of statutory and regulatory authority.

Evidence. Build cases on unequivocal facts and “gold-standard” science; unsupported allegations erode credibility and delay compliance.

Analysis. Apply rigorous reasoning to connect evidence with legal requirements, where remedies are to be proportionate and tailored.

Programmatic Impact. Consider ripple effects across EPA programs — permitting, monitoring, and beyond — including whether the proposed enforcement would inadvertently expand regulatory scope.

Stakeholder Impact. Evaluate how actions affect states, Tribes, and regulated entities and aim to act swiftly to prevent third-party litigation from distorting policy.

Next Steps: Process Consistency and Forthcoming Tools

To reduce ambiguity across air, water, waste, and chemicals programs, EPA intends to work with the US Office of General Counsel to consolidate criteria across all media defining when violations warrant formal enforcement, informal enforcement, or field warnings, improving national consistency and public transparency. Until that guidance is issued, the memo advises case teams to follow current practices informed by the memo’s principles.

EPA also sets a national escalation pathway for legal ambiguity. According to the memo, where a facility raises a credible interpretive concern, or staff identify material ambiguity, issues must be promptly elevated to ensure nationally consistent application of federal law.

Bottom Line and Practical Implications for the Regulated Community

EPA’s “Compliance First” policy could be a structural shift in enforcement philosophy. By embedding LEAPS into decision-making and rescinding prior guidance on broad remedies, the agency is signaling an intent to focus on clear law, solid evidence, and practical solutions. For practitioners, understanding this framework might be essential to navigating enforcement in 2026 and beyond.

For regulated entities, the headline is that EPA now expresses speed and clarity as key decisional criteria. Facilities should anticipate more proactive technical assistance and “find-and-fix” encouragement. In turn, companies that come prepared with rapid corrective action plans aligned to the “best reading” of applicable requirements may see faster resolution paths and narrower injunctive terms.

Compliance strategies should be anchored firmly in text and established practice, with legal positions documented against the canons and precedents EPA highlights. Where ambiguity exists, elevating issues early — supported by technical and legal analysis — may facilitate national-level clarity and avoid local inconsistencies.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15973_4423.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:03:28.743499

Reduced government subsidies late in the year are expected to weigh on consumer sentiment in the months ahead.

North America posted the sharpest decline. EV registrations fell 42% in November to just over 100,000 vehicles, following a similar drop in October after U.S. tax credits expired. Sales in the region are now down 1% so far this year, placing North America on track for its first annual decline since 2019.

Europe remained a bright spot. EV registrations climbed 36% to more than 400,000 vehicles, supported by national incentive programs. Sales in Europe are up by a third so far this year compared with the same period of 2024, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

EV registrations in the rest of the world rose 35% to almost 160,000 vehicles, reflecting continued adoption outside the major markets.

The slowdown comes as electric transport advocates continue to push for rapid adoption to curb carbon emissions, while automakers and governments reassess EV commitments amid slower-than-expected consumer uptake. Industry groups have warned that declining demand could threaten jobs and profit margins.

Policy uncertainty is adding to the pressure. In the U.S., President Donald Trump recently proposed cutting fuel economy standards finalized under the previous administration. In Europe, the European Union has delayed proposals that could weaken a planned 2035 ban on new CO2-emitting vehicles. In China, reduced subsidies are expected to further cool demand in the coming months.

With data centres driving more gas power capacity and their demand piling onto already stretched grids, many naturally worry that their rapid growth could slow or even derail the energy transition.
“Data centres generally aim for a downtime of less than five minutes per year.
Similar government-backed deployment pathways for SMR-powered data centres were evident in the UK and Canada.
“These investments will be critical to integrating new power capacity and ensuring the stability of increasingly complex grids,” says Singh.","While 2025 saw clean energy account for the bulk of new capacity additions, grids continued to lag, struggling to integrate this new supply – not rendering the energy transition moot but certainly raising concerns about the pace of change. On top of this, electricity demand is rising faster than ever, and the source of growth is no longer just homes or traditional industry.

Three key themes set the tone for the energy industry this year: data centres wreaking havoc on global power systems; tariffs doing the same to supply chains; and worsening grid bottlenecks alongside persistent efforts to flip this around.

In the past year, data centres have moved into the heart of global energy dialogue, not only reshaping the industry’s supply chains and investment decisions but also forcing the sector to rethink how power is generated, distributed and consumed.

Data centres are becoming a major driver of global electricity demand, with their consumption set to reach 945 terawatt-hours by 2030 – roughly 3% of global consumption. By that point, in the US, where data centre growth is most expansive, they are expected to use more power than all other energy-intensive industries combined – including aluminium, steel, cement and chemicals.

The power industry has therefore been trying to answer: how will we meet this demand? For one, data centres can be built within three years, but the energy systems they require often take far longer to develop. They are also extremely energy-intensive, operating 24/7 with virtually zero tolerance for outages, necessitating a load profile not all power sources can easily guarantee.

The tech and energy worlds are responding with a mix of strategies including buying from the grid, negotiating long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and co-locating data centres with power generation facilities.

Gas-fired power appeals as a solution as it “offers better grid stability than other energy sources, with the flexibility of being able to be quickly started and stopped and the reliability of constant, strong power generation,” says Pavan Vyakaranam, senior power analyst at Power Technology’s parent company, GlobalData.

In the US, he notes that gas also has a political edge: “With Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies in place, it is both more economical and, from a clearances perspective, easier to roll out gas-based projects than others like renewables.”

These circumstances have presented a new opportunity for gas producers, with 2025 seeing many utilities like Entergy Louisiana, NextEra Energy and GE Vernova revise their plans to invest in gigawatt (GW)-scale projects aimed squarely at meeting data centre demand.

With data centres driving more gas power capacity and their demand piling onto already stretched grids, many naturally worry that their rapid growth could slow or even derail the energy transition.

To this, Vyakaranam responds: “Data centres are indeed making the energy transition more complex – but not unworkable.”

In the short term, he confirms that “their large, fast-growing demand may force grids to rely more on gas and delay the retirement of some fossil capacity, especially where transmission and storage are lagging”. According to GlobalData, gas and coal together will meet more than 40% of data centre electricity demand until at least 2030.

“At the same time,” he says, “hyperscalers are among the biggest buyers of renewables and are increasingly backing energy storage, advanced grid tech and even early-stage clean energy options like fusion and next‑gen nuclear.”

While renewable energy “cannot be a sole solution for data centres without any backup power” due to its intermittent nature, the rapid growth of the energy storage market – driven in large part by hyperscalers themselves – is now making renewables just as competitive. GlobalData forecasts that renewables – currently responsible for around 30% of data centre power supply – will contribute at least half the share by 2030.

Many tech giants have turned to renewables in the form of PPAs. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta and Apple currently stand as the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy globally and have contracted almost 50GW of capacity to date.

Hyperscalers are also exploring co-location, through which developers can cut development timelines, costs and grid congestion. Google has partnered with Intersect Power and TPGRise Climate to develop co-located renewable projects, while Chevron, Engine No. 1 and GE Vernova are looking to supply 4GW of co-located gas capacity.

However, nuclear power is emerging as the most compelling co-location option due to “synergies in load profiles”, says Harminder Singh, GlobalData’s director of power research and analysis. “Data centres generally aim for a downtime of less than five minutes per year. Nuclear power plants have a flat baseload generation profile, hence are able to meet this requirement.”

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are at the centre of this shift, as their smaller size allows for easier on-site deployment, minimising risks of transmission loss. To date, around 25GW of data centre-linked SMR capacity has been announced.

In 2025, the SMR-data centre relationship moved from concept toward commercial reality. “We saw multiple deals for SMRs to power data centres, providing a financing model where high‑cost nuclear is matched with very stable, creditworthy demand,” Vyakaranam explains.

Policy support has also become more concrete, with Vyakaranam pointing to the US’ shift in federal funding and programmes “from broad R&D support to supporting commercially realistic SMR projects that can be built this decade”, making the technology more “bankable”. Similar government-backed deployment pathways for SMR-powered data centres were evident in the UK and Canada.

“Nuclear projects require relatively more time for buildout, thus won’t be favoured over gas or renewables in the near-term,” Vyakaranam notes. “However, from 2030 onwards, date centres will be increasingly powered by nuclear, then renewables, then gas.”

GlobalData forecasts that at least 3GW of additional date centre-linked SMR capacity will be commissioned in the next three years, and nuclear deployment for data centres will peak between 2031 and 2035.

Amid these discussions, many have questioned what would happen if the data centre hype turns out to be a bubble, but Vyakaranam assures: “Compute use demand is strong, so a total bust is unlikely. If companies do overbuild, they can fall back on slowing new capital expenditure, leasing excess space and repurposing sites for other energy‑intensive industries, or selling assets to infrastructure investors.

“The associated grid upgrades and clean power contracts would still support the energy transition,” he concludes. “Despite the burden they are putting on power systems now, over time, if policies and grid planning catch up, data centres are more likely to reshape the energy transition – towards more firm, low‑carbon capacity and demand flexibility – than to derail it.”

Supply chain: gas bottlenecks, renewables’ tariff hit and T&D triumphs

The challenge for gas-fired power amid the energy transition has oddly been not demand but supply. While the gas industry cheered the boost from data centres, the equipment market has struggled to keep up with their demand – “on top of the substantial volumes of new gas-fired capacity utilities planned to meet overall electricity demand growth”, Singh adds.

New gas turbine orders have surged over the past two years, something that equipment manufacturers were unprepared for having made limited investments in manufacturing capacity.

As a result, turbine deliveries for new gas plants now face delays of several years. GE Vernova and Mitsubishi, for example, both see order backlogs stretching into 2028 and 2030.

“This has hampered the development of new gas-based power, forcing developers to reassess timelines and driving up project costs,” Singh says.

Meanwhile, 2025 delivered a mixed bag for the renewables supply chain.

The solar supply chain is feeling the tension between supply and policy. Module production has grown exponentially since 2019, with key manufacturers like Jinko, Longi and Trina dramatically scaling output. What resulted was oversupply, which has consequently lowered the costs of solar projects.

This progress, however, was slightly offset this year by trade policies. In the US, GlobalData estimates that Trump’s tariffs could raise the cost of utility-scale solar projects by around 10%, driven by a 30% cost increase for modules and inverters – components the US still relies heavily on imports for.

Despite ongoing efforts to expand domestic manufacturing, in the foreseeable future, “the tariffs and new anti-dumping and countervailing duties on South East Asian cells and modules are likely to create genuine supply bottlenecks and unprecedented challenges for renewable energy deployment”, Singh warns.

The offshore wind supply chain has been hit even harder. The latest tariff hike on steel and aluminium – integral to wind turbines – has significantly driven up offshore wind project costs. For instance, Dominion Energy’s 2.6GW Coastal Virginia offshore wind farm saw its capital cost rise from $10.9bn to $11.2bn following the tariff blow.

These pressures are compounded by the Trump administration’s broader hostility towards offshore wind, which has already triggered project delays and heightened investor uncertainty.

“Forecasts are quite pessimistic in the near-term,” Singh concedes, but notes that these supply chain woes still “didn’t stop the build-out of new renewables”.

Transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment manufacturers enjoyed a far more positive year, seeing active investment flows into capacity expansion. Cable makers like Prysmian, Nexans and NKT Denmark announced investment in the millions and even billions to ramp up production, while transformer suppliers including Hitachi, Hyundai Electric, Siemens Energy and Toshiba are scaling up capacity with projects spanning multiple continents.

The T&D equipment market’s financial pulse is growing stronger, reflecting the industry’s increasing focus on improving and expanding grid infrastructure. “These investments will be critical to integrating new power capacity and ensuring the stability of increasingly complex grids,” says Singh.

Grid constraints ease with reform and storage

Even with robust T&D investments this year, power grids are still ill-equipped; interconnection queues have grown longer in 2025, unable to connect new capacity – most of which are solar and wind. As it stands, grid bottlenecks remain a major hurdle to a smoother clean energy transition.

However, grid reforms are beginning to ease some these constraints. In 2025, the US updated its regulatory rules to streamline connection processes; the UK’s energy regulator announced similar plans, accelerating almost 8GW of connection; and Brazil permitted 10GW of projects to leave interconnection queues without penalty. Transmission infrastructure expansion is also going strong, with high-voltage direct current (HVDC) projects finding favour due to lower network losses.

China is leading the way, specialising in ultra-HVDC technology and planning more than $200bn (1.41tn yuan) in investment in transmission lines by the end of the year. In Europe, subsea HVDC interconnectors such as the Viking Link and North Sea Link are transmitting electricity across hundreds of kilometres beyond national borders; this year, developers began exploring the feasibility of even longer cables spanning thousands of kilometres, connecting Canada to the UK or Australia to Singapore.

While grids scramble to keep pace, energy storage seeks to hold down the fort.

Among different technologies, batteries stand out most, with GlobalData projecting that 2025 will see annual battery capacity additions that are nearly double those of 2024 – leading to a 63% year-on-year increase in cumulative global capacity.

“Battery storage is no longer a supporting actor but a necessity to modern power systems,” Singh says. “We saw multiple applications for batteries emerge this year, from energy shifting and black start capabilities to providing ancillary services in grids and capacity support for system adequacy.”",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/12/shutterstock_2520228829.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:02:39.597115

This area has long avoided the oil refineries and gas processing plants that dominate cities farther up the Gulf like Corpus Christi, Houston, Freeport, Galveston, and Port Arthur. What little presence the oil and gas industry has had here centered on shipping product out of the Brownsville Ship Channel, which connects the eponymous city to the lagoon, and this activity mostly dried up late last century.

But all that is changing. This summer, two storage tanks for the huge new liquefied natural gas project, Rio Grande LNG, have emerged to towering heights over the state highway that links Brownsville, some 20 miles west, to the 5,000-person town of Port Isabel. The project, set to be the first of its kind in the Rio Grande Valley, will chill gas coming through pipelines—laid over the past decade amid the country’s “shale revolution”—into liquid form 1/600th the substance’s previous size. This liquefied gas will then be exported via massive tanker ships past the jetties of South Padre Island and across the world. The under-construction project has already poured concrete over nearly a thousand acres of ecologically fragile wetlands and lomas, clay dunes formed over thousands of years.

This transformative development has been aggressively touted by NextDecade, the publicly traded Houston-based company behind Rio Grande LNG, as a job creator that will be environmentally sensitive and won’t affect tourism. But locals say it threatens existing ecotourism and fishing industries, and federal regulators have agreed, pointing to the number of LNG tankers coming in and out of the ship channel.

Nearly 100 years ago, Cameron County commissioners initiated the creation of the Brownsville Ship Channel, wanting the Valley to venture into a new phase of global economic engagement by exporting the area’s plentiful citrus and cotton overseas. As decades wore on, companies like Marathon built offshore oil rigs at the Port of Brownsville and employed hundreds before closing in the late 1980s after the country’s oil bust. Union Carbide, a chemical manufacturer, met the same fate as butane prices doubled, leaving workers jobless after the plant closed.

Trade, logistics, rig-building, and shipbreaking haven’t left the port, with the various companies there employing about 3,400 people. But today’s officials in Brownsville—population 190,000—want something bigger: to bring back the oil and gas industry as part of a region-wide attempt to remake the area’s economy into a hub of international corporate investment. To help realize this vision, Rio Grande LNG is fronting the cost of dredging the channel deep enough for some of the largest tankers ever made to traverse.

Though this will be the first such facility in deep South Texas, gas export plants have spread across the Gulf Coast over the past several years. The United States has become the largest gas exporter in the world, thanks to new installations built along the coastal portions of Texas and Louisiana. And LNG firms are further expanding these facilities despite a projected oversupply of gas, some citing vague “growing Asian demand” as a reason. These expansions are also aided by the Trump administration’s attempt to geopolitically leverage gas in striking trade deals.

If NextDecade successfully builds out Rio Grande LNG to the size it’s planning, it will be one of the two largest facilities in the country by export volume.

While the project is strongly supported by officials in the Brownsville area, it’s been consistently opposed by the leaders of communities much closer to the site such as Port Isabel and South Padre Island, which will bear the brunt of pollution or industrial disaster and live off incompatible industries. “It’s not a plus for tourism. It’s not a plus for the environment. It’s not a plus for our community,” South Padre Island Councilman Joe Ricco told the Texas Observer. “It’s not a plus for residents—unless you’re maybe the pilot boat captain,” he said, referring to the tugboats that will guide incoming tankers.

LNG companies from Texas to Louisiana have pitched themselves as saviors of economically barren lands, and politicians like those in Brownsville have actively joined the PR push—often alongside considerable direct communication with, and campaign donations from, the companies. To measure the distance between this rhetoric and reality, and to essentially peer into the murky future of the Laguna Madre area, the Observer has reported out the impacts of LNG facilities in the industrialized town of Freeport and in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.

What’s clear on the ground in these Gulf communities is that a second gulf exists between the companies’ rosy promises and their mixed impacts in reality. And many locals believe the projects have yielded more harm than good. As the oil and gas industry further pushes the climate toward irreversible change, LNG export plants are doing the same to the communities where they operate.

About an hour southeast of Houston, Freeport is one of several cities that make up the Brazosport area, the coastal appendage of Brazoria County. The 11,000 people who live in the city are surrounded by a seemingly never-ending stretch of petrochemical facilities—operated by Dow, BASF, and dozens of other corporations—where the smokestacks, machinery, and administration buildings all blend together. Among them are two plants run by Freeport LNG, which has been in the area for some 20 years, first as a gas importer and later as an exporter.

As the company moved toward exports about a decade ago, when the West Texas fracking boom achieved liftoff, Freeport LNG ramped up community relations all over the county, promising plentiful new jobs and billions to be spent on construction. While not as old or big as other corporate giants in this industrial town, Freeport LNG still looms large. Several buildings, including the local theater and the hospital’s intensive care unit, bear the company’s name. Since exporting its first shipment in 2019, the company has regularly sponsored local events, including Port Freeport’s Take-A-Child Fishing Tournament.

But local organizers say philanthropy doesn’t excuse the lucrative tax breaks it takes in or the pollution it spews out. “They are not interested in being good neighbors, except for doing things that will put their name on a water tower or school or something and make them look good,” Gary Witt, a retired marketing professor and chair of the Better Brazoria organization, told me in May at Sweet T’s, a downtown diner.

In the streets outside, broken glass, downed fences, and shingles were still littered from last year’s Hurricane Beryl. This part of the city was mostly lifeless, despite being next to Port Freeport and a couple miles from Freeport LNG.

Since 2015, the local school district, Brazoria County, the City of Freeport, and a neighboring city have given Freeport LNG a combined $1 billion in tax abatement deals. The City of Freeport alone is projected to forgo over $321 million in property taxes for Freeport LNG, according to an economic analysis commissioned by Better Brazoria, by the time the agreement ends in 2029. The city has opted for payments in lieu of taxes, receiving about $2 million a year from the company.

Freeport LNG says the tax handouts are well worth the project’s contributions to the local tax base. Company spokesperson Heather Browne told the Observer the corporation will pay “$2.6 billion in taxes to local Brazoria County taxing jurisdictions over the course of the company’s initial 20-year operating life,” on top of generating additional taxable economic activity. In company literature, Freeport LNG has said it employs 230 people in Brazoria County and created 9,000 construction jobs during its build-out, which took about five years. Although the company receives more tax abatements than any other entity in the county, it’s not among the top 10 largest employers in Freeport, last year’s city budget shows.

Since exports began, Census data shows median income rose and poverty rates fell in Freeport at levels exceeding state and nationwide trends. Donald Payne, an economics professor at Brazosport College, said the gas facility is one part of the explanation: “Since 2019, Freeport LNG, the Port of Freeport, and the petrochemical industry all experienced growth. Together, they created hundreds of high-wage jobs directly and many more indirectly,” Payne told the Observer in an email, though he noted that “Based on personal experience, many Freeport LNG workers appear to live outside the city.”

A short drive from downtown Freeport are Quintana, population 30, and its beaches, where Freeport LNG’s liquefaction plant looms. The facility occupies much of the island town, or what’s left of it. Some of the few people who live there now work for the company or the county beach park on the north end of the island. Most of the town’s annual revenue comes from the roughly $1 million a year Freeport LNG pays directly as part of a property tax break deal. One council member is an employee of the company.

Quintana is a major stopover for migratory birds, with at least 325 species documented there. The island’s observation tower was constructed by Freeport LNG, and some of the land that makes up bird and nature sanctuaries was donated by the company. The hum of nearby tanker ships competes constantly with birdsong.

The beaches are usually well attended in the summer—as they were when the LNG plant exploded in 2022. The explosion, which damaged the LNG facility and caused a toddler on the beach to injure his face on a rock, was caused by trapped gas that burst through a pipe and was ignited by a damaged wire. A contributing cause, a federal investigation found, was an overworked, understaffed crew. Three years before, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) had fined Freeport LNG after operators pushed gas at 917 pounds per square inch of pressure through a pipe rated for just 90 pounds, breaking the pipe and releasing 315 million feet of gas.

Two busloads of kids on a field trip were on the beach during the explosion, two locals who were present told the Observer. People were unsure what to do. Local authorities issued a voluntary evacuation notice. Those who left the island had to drive past the site of the explosion as the company contained the fire. When federal regulators held a public briefing for residents to learn about the explosion, Freeport LNG didn’t attend.

Melanie Oldham, the executive director of Better Brazoria, said the company needs to update its public emergency response plan. “How do people know how or where to evacuate? Do they try to get over this one bridge?” she asked as we drove back to Freeport from Quintana. Browne, the Freeport LNG spokesperson, told the Observer that the safety of its workforce and community is “top priority” for the company. Regarding the explosion, Browne referred to the company’s 2022 Sustainability and Community Investment report, which points to the company fixing and modifying the valves that led to the incident, hiring more employees, and retraining staff. She declined to comment on Oldham’s statement about the response plan.

Since the 2022 explosion, Freeport LNG has continued to have “emissions events,” which are unplanned releases of chemicals. The plant and its pretreatment facility have had 98 since the explosion and 134 before that, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds of air pollution, including benzene and carbon monoxide. In all, Freeport LNG has paid around $2.6 million in fines to various federal and state agencies. Freeport LNG is now planning to add a fourth “train,” the machines that cool gas into liquid.

Local governments in the area have backed the company through more than just tax breaks. When Freeport LNG needed permission from the Department of Energy (DOE) to export gas to countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the United States, the company ghostwrote letters of support for local elected officials and organizations to submit to the federal department. Public records obtained by the Observer show that Freeport LNG’s public relations team gave a prewritten letter to Brazoria County Judge Matt Sebesta in 2021. Sebesta submitted the letter with minimal edits. Several other organizations and local elected officials also sent the same letter. Two years later, the DOE approved Freeport LNG’s request.

In downtown Freeport during my May visit, I took a walk with Manning Rollerson, who has lived in the city most of his life, growing up on the East End. He pointed out long-gone establishments from his youth, where shrimp boats used to dock, and the names of the historic buildings, empty but still standing.

We started at Freeport’s former city hall building, which was vacated last March. There was broken glass around the building, and its drive-through lanes, left over from when the building was a bank, were rotting away. As we continued walking, we saw that—save for a few offices, the Freeport City Museum, and some apartments—downtown was little more than a pass-through for people leaving the nearby port, where several industrial giants operate, including Phillips 66, Chiquita, and Freeport LNG.

“For all the money that is spent on [tax breaks], why is downtown looking like this? This is the heart of the city,” said Rollerson, who founded the Freeport Haven Project, a grassroots group advocating against pollution in Brazoria County, and has traveled all over the world advocating against LNG development and fossil fuels generally.

Rollerson said international leaders are often more receptive to his message than local officials are. “I’m gonna make it plain and simple: They don’t give a damn what we say when it comes to the industry.”

We approached the East End. Separated from downtown by Navigation Boulevard, this was a neighborhood, segregated by the city in the 1930s, where Black and brown people lived for decades. With most of those homes bought and demolished by Port Freeport, the land is being turned into storage lots as the port expands northwest toward downtown. Rollerson pointed to where his grandmother’s home had been, the park he used to go to as a kid, and the homes of family and friends. Now barren land, it will all be part of the port soon.

Rollerson is a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit alleging that the City of Freeport and Port Freeport violated the civil rights of East End property owners when it bought, some via eminent domain, and demolished homes in the neighborhood after purposefully disinvesting in the area. In 2022, the Department of Homeland Security’s Civil Rights Division agreed to review the lawsuit, but Lone Star Legal Aid, the lead attorneys in the suit, told the Observer that progress has since stalled after the Department of Government Efficiency laid off the DHS staff who were working on it.

“I don’t even see a future for nobody, based on our government,” Rollerson said. “If we don’t die from toxic poisoning, we’re gonna die from being broke and sick. When will we ever see the American dream?”

Brazoria County has rates of lung and bronchial cancer, which can be caused by particulate matter and benzene, above the national average. A little over 50,000 residents here don’t have health insurance.

As for downtown, Freeport Economic Development Corporation’s executive director Robert Johnson said most building owners are sitting on their properties in hopes that they can sell or lease them for more money in the future. He wants to avoid downtown being totally absorbed: “I would not want to see the downtown eaten up by the port, because they would just raze it,” Johnson said.

Despite his concern, Johnson said the city’s industry is a strength. The various companies here bring in a commuter population that dwarfs the number of local residents, which he said creates a spillover effect benefiting the local economy.

Port Freeport did not respond to the Observer’s questions for this story. Neither did Brazoria County or any Freeport city council member.

When driving from Texas into Louisiana on State Highway 82, after Sabine Pass LNG’s massive trains, the road runs parallel to the coast, but you don’t see any water for half an hour. Instead, you see trees, cow pastures, and gas processing structures—some operating, some abandoned—before finally reaching the coastal prairie and its brown gulf water; the town of Holly Beach, with its homes raised on pilings as high as 15 feet; and the surviving trees stripped of their foliage and gnarled from hurricanes. The few locals can watch LNG tankers from their porches pass into the Calcasieu Ship Channel, which spans from the coast all the way up to Lake Charles. In 1959, the first LNG exported from the United States left through this channel, sent to the United Kingdom as a test run for an industry that would concentrate here decades later.

At Holly Beach’s eastern edge are John Allaire and his 150-acre property. With a clear view from his mobile home’s porch, Allaire, a 69-year-old geologist who worked four decades as an environmental coordinator in the oil and gas industry, has been documenting just about everything related to Calcasieu Pass LNG, a 4-year-old, 432-acre facility owned by Virginia-based Venture Global that sits across the channel. When I met him in May, he spread maps, photos, and reports on a bench to show me the 4,700-person Cameron Parish now being surrounded by LNG facilities on every side but the coast. Starting with Sabine Pass LNG, which received the country’s first license after the Obama administration authorized LNG exports, it took just under a decade for three additional plants to emerge, with four more on the way.

He showed me a photo he took of a ship named Clean Energy in the channel with a stream of fire coming out of the plant’s flare stack. “That’s what clean energy looks like here on the Louisiana coast,” he said.

Within its first year of operating, in 2022, Allaire assessed that Calcasieu Pass LNG had violated its air permit more than 2,000 times by overemitting after accidents and equipment malfunctions. Alongside the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, a statewide environmental justice organization, Allaire found that more than half the time, in 2023, Venture Global was not reporting violations on time or at all. The state environmental regulator sent a compliance order to the company that same year, but nothing has come of it. In 2024, Allaire documented the plant flaring for 95 hours straight when it’s only permitted to do so for 60 hours annually.

Despite all this, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which regulates LNG plant construction, green-lighted a second Venture Global facility farther into the unincorporated hamlet of Cameron last June. Four months later, the corporation successfully asked the state if it could increase its emissions at the first facility by up to 700,000 tons of greenhouse gasses and other pollutants.

Cameron Parish (named after a different Cameron than Cameron County, Texas, where Rio Grande LNG is being built) holds the distinction of having the fastest-shrinking population in Louisiana. But even with fewer locals to take jobs at the plants, Venture Global is now planning yet a third facility.

On Allaire’s side of the ship channel, Commonwealth LNG, developed by the Houston company Catarus, was set to start construction later this year. In October, Louisiana’s state court canceled the project’s construction permit; the court said state regulators did not consider how Commonwealth LNG—along with other established facilities in Cameron Parish—would affect coastal erosion and rising sea levels in Louisiana. But the state reissued the permit in mid-November. Commonwealth LNG did not respond to the Observer’s request for comment.

At its original Calcasieu Pass facility, Venture Global employs about 300 people, saying a majority of those employees come from Cameron or nearby parishes. In exchange, Cameron Parish and the state lavished the firm with billions in tax abatements.

Cameron Parish Port President Howard Romero said in 2023 that once the company starts paying property taxes, the parish would become the “Riviera of the world.” But the state renewed the first Venture plant’s tax abatements later that same year, meaning the company won’t pay property taxes—about $923 million in all—for another three years. The state also gave Venture Global a tax abatement for its second plant, letting the company off the hook for another $1.67 billion in property taxes, in a parish where the average annual income is $34,000.

On the main road into Cameron, I passed a mural that depicted a long-gone town—one that used to catch the most seafood in the country. Made in 1975, the artwork states that the town’s population was 2,510 people then. Census data says about 300 people live here now, but locals say it’s likely far fewer. There’s one gas station in town, with a food truck next door that serves po’boys and used to be a brick-and-mortar before Hurricane Laura in 2020 ripped it off its foundation. The remains of the restaurant now lie a block away in front of a church, also destroyed. Even the Catholic church won’t be rebuilding here, as insurers won’t fund this hurricane-prone place anymore. There are no hospitals or grocery stores.

The newest construction in town is the Lighthouse Bend restaurant, market, RV park, and marina, opened by Venture Global in 2024. The upscale establishment is juxtaposed against the LNG facilities just down the road from it and the storm-damaged homes, shrimp yards, and incessant dust that follows every truck. The parish and Venture Global built the marina after the latter had cut off public access to a parish-owned jetty park, which had a fishing pier and camper spaces along the ship channel (similar to Isla Blanca Park on South Padre Island). Mark Daigle, a Cameron Parish Police juror, told local media last year the project was turning Cameron into a place where displaced residents can return after hurricanes: “I truly believe [with] what we’ll be getting off LNG and everything like that, we will be able to put ourself in a place to where we can possibly help the people come back home.”

The local shrimping industry, a large part of the area’s culture, has all but disappeared since LNG arrived. Local shrimpers say they can’t catch anything when the ships pass through and drive the shrimp away. They also say constant dredging to deepen the ship channel worsens the problem; research suggests that this dredging kicks up sediment that harms sea life in a variety of ways. FERC acknowledged the same phenomenon in its final environmental impact statement on Venture Global’s second project but said that the effects could be mitigated.

Some locals say the tankers could help by coming later in the day, but companies won’t do that. Nowadays, Cameron Parish shrimpers drag nets 10 miles away in Vermillion Bay, where there is no tanker traffic. The difference between before and after the gas plants came is hundreds of thousands of dollars and pounds of shrimp.

The shrimpers who’ve stayed are now venturing into other businesses. Captain Anthony “Tad” Theriot, who quit school in 10th grade and has been shrimping ever since, spent the opening day of shrimp season at an oyster farm where he’s been working for extra income.

I met him that night on his boat, which is docked at the last shrimp house in town. He told me of life in Cameron back when there were grocery stores, a movie theater, even a skating rink. Hurricanes destroyed it all, and the LNG companies, despite their promises of prosperity, haven’t brought it back. Theriot put both his sons through college with shrimp money, but just last year, he tied up his boat for the season and had to get financial help from a local nonprofit.

“They got motherfuckers at Walmart making what I make,” Theriot said, adding that he’s ready to sell his boat and leave the industry. ”I can’t even make a living in my own house [where he would sell catches]. So what do I want to be here for?”

Another shrimper, Melissa Richard, who owns a shop in Hackberry, 30 miles north beside another LNG facility operated by a different company, echoed that she might leave the business that supported three generations of her family. “What else am I supposed to do? To me, I’ve made it to the top,” Richard told the Observer. “My dream was to have my own shrimp house. I’m living my dream, and it’s sinking.”

All this local change, according to companies like Venture Global, comes with a global benefit. The company believes that LNG reduces climate change by displacing coal plants. But, in recent years, coal has been primarily replaced by renewables like solar and wind rather than gas, even as the LNG industry continues expanding. Meanwhile, natural gas facilities, including Venture Global’s, frequently release massive quantities of methane—a powerful accelerant of climate change, the very phenomenon that intensifies the hurricanes that have ravaged this part of southwest Louisiana.

Venture Global did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Neither did Cameron Parish Police Jury President Ronald Nunez, or Police Juror Magnus McGee, whose district covers Cameron.

On the last day before I left the Louisiana coast, I met 72-year-old Sherry Peshoff, who lives near the planned location of Venture’s second LNG facility and on the same street where she was raised.

Peshoff can remember 1957’s Hurricane Audrey, which killed at least 500 people—more than live in the town of Cameron today. She remembers being inside a home with hundreds of others as it lifted off its foundation; she lost her paternal grandparents and uncle. Still, she grew up here shrimping with her siblings and dad. “He raised all four of us kids out of the Gulf,” she said. “The same gulf waters that took his family.”

From her raised porch, the existing Venture Global facility blocks most of the view, and the company is snatching up the properties that surround her. Leaving is becoming less a question of if than when. Once she’s gone, she expects the industry that helped drive her out to face a reckoning. “I have a gut feeling God has got something in store for this place. They’ve taken all the churches out. To me, that plant is causing a lot of trouble, and to me, the Lord’s going to let a big hurricane come and wipe this place out.”

Before leaving, I asked her what she’d tell residents of the Laguna Madre area in deep South Texas, which shares a waning shrimping industry and similar hurricane prone-ness.

“Cameron’s never going to be the same,” Peshoff said of her small patch of the Louisiana coast. “And you can bank on it: Your hometown’s not going to be the same neither.”

Back in Texas, Rio Grande LNG isn’t expected to export gas for another couple of years, but it’s already changing some aspects of life in Port Isabel, the coastal city where I grew up.

State Highway 48 has a new stoplight, directing trucks and heavy equipment from Rio Grande LNG’s site, piling up traffic in both directions in the morning and at quitting time. Data from the Texas Department of Transportation acquired by the Observer shows that more car accidents are happening near the site than before construction started, two years ago.

Long Island Village, a tiny golf-course community of mostly retirees, is connected to Port Isabel via a swing bridge. Dredge boats and vessels bringing material to the LNG site have regularly collided with that bridge, and one such incident snapped the cable.

In July, a shrimp boat sank in the channel, throwing two people onboard into the water. The captain was found dead a few days later. It was the first time a shrimper from the area had died on the water in years. Two local shrimpers told the Observer the boat hit a dredge pipe siphoning sediment to expand the channel for LNG. Spokespeople for the Port of Brownsville and the U.S. Coast Guard told the Observer they hadn’t heard of a dredge pipe being the cause. The Guard denied a Freedom of Information Act request, saying the investigation remains open. Great Lakes Dredging, the company expanding the channel, didn’t respond.

In town, Port Isabel residents are wondering what risks come with Rio Grande LNG being just 3 miles away. One resident, Marta Duran, lives off Port Road in what used to be Port Isabel’s Palangana neighborhood, a five-minute drive from the LNG site. At the end of her street is an abandoned oil refinery, cleared of structures and reclaimed by native flora over decades. Just a few miles away is Rio Grande LNG and, across the channel, Elon Musk’s SpaceX launch site. Duran worries one of SpaceX’s semi-frequent explosions could lead to a secondary explosion at the gas plant. (A consulting firm hired by NextDecade determined in 2017 that this was exceedingly unlikely, but that was based on smaller rockets than the ones Musk is using today.)

She’s heard local officials and NextDecade talk about the advantages LNG will bring but little else. “In my opinion, the community is not being given complete information. It’s more like advertising of benefits,” Duran said. “They are not talking about how to react in case of a catastrophe, a community emergency.”

A home health worker, Duran is a member of Vecinos para el Bienestar de la Comunidad Costera, a coalition of Port Isabel residents who were part of a lawsuit against FERC and NextDecade that got the company’s federal authorization revoked last August and forced the company to go through another environmental analysis.

But, this March, the same court that canceled the FERC approval reinstated it—and FERC then published its court-ordered environmental review and approved Rio Grande LNG. Vecinos, along with the City of Port Isabel and other groups, asked FERC for a rehearing in September, saying Rio Grande LNG’s plans to add more trains, and export more gas from them, was not being considered. But FERC never responded, effectively denying the request.

For the closest communities, Rio Grande LNG will bring carcinogens and particulate matter. FERC has said the emissions pose no “significant” threat, but federal public health agencies say any exposure is unsafe. As for explosions, NextDecade says that it has safeguards in place, but gas companies and FERC keep emergency response plans under wraps, saying release would pose a security risk.

NextDecade says there’ll be up to 5,000 construction jobs at the project’s peak and 250 permanent positions. Those are significant numbers for the Laguna Madre area, but the prospect of a carcinogen-emitting facility just a couple miles from Port Isabel’s only grocery store—and of shrimp or recreational boat traffic being halted routinely for LNG tankers—makes what I saw in Freeport and Cameron Parish seem like a telling omen.

Officials in Brownsville and Cameron County continue to strongly support Rio Grande LNG, while the communities closest to the site remain opposed. Jared Hockema, Port Isabel’s city manager, said the export plants threaten existing tourism and fishing industries and that LNG is a shortsighted economic strategy.",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSCF1051-1-scaled-3.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:03:55.412656

Reporters relied on Wayne State experts for clarity and insight on the year’s biggest developments — from geopolitics and labor disputes to scientific breakthroughs, workforce trends, public health issues, community initiatives and campus news.

In total, more than 3,300 stories that featured or mentioned Wayne State were captured in 2025 by media outlets around the world, extending from Detroit’s daily newspapers, television and radio to national media outlets like The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, CNN, Fox News, CBS, NBC, ABC, Yahoo News, and numerous international outlets and higher education publications.

Included in the overall number were 1,131 stories that focused primarily or exclusively on the university, known as Tier I media placements. It is the third consecutive year that Wayne State surpassed 1,100 top-tier media hits.

The public relations team in University Communications and Marketing annually tracks and analyzes media activity content and geographical reach. Data is captured through several monitoring tools and identified by a tier structure – Tier I, II and III. Tiers II and III, though not focused entirely or exclusively on Wayne State, feature faculty experts commenting on trending topics — commonly referred to as pull quotes and sound bites.

The public relations team facilitates interview requests, develops monthly tip sheets, and distributes news releases to proactively engage WSU experts with local and national media.

More than 20 professors and administrators had 10 or more media hits each 2025. Labor expert Marick Masters, professor emeritus at the Mike Ilitch School of Business, led the way with 75 media hits.

In 2010, Democrats implemented the Affordable Care Act – more accurately called the Unaffordable Care Act – with the promise that it would lower premiums and health care costs and allow people to keep their existing plans and doctors. Instead, it did the opposite. Since the Unaffordable Care Act took effect, premiums have increased for American workers and families by 80 percent.

To cover up for their failure and broken promises, Democrats send hundreds of billions of dollars to insurance companies to mask the high cost of the Unaffordable Care Act, keeping Americans trapped in a broken program. Democrats are focused on the 7 percent of Americans on Obamacare, while House Republicans are working to deliver better choices and premiums for ALL Americans.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to reform the health care system Democrats broke by providing better choices for workers and families, boosting competition, and increasing transparency to lower health care costs for every American. Our legislation includes provisions to:

Codify and expand Association Health Plans and CHOICE Arrangements, providing small businesses and employees more affordable health care options, and safeguard stop-loss insurance for small employers

Allocate money for Cost-Sharing Reductions (CSRs) that lower premiums in the individual market by more than 12 percent

Demand transparency from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) with employers so small businesses can negotiate better deals and lower costs for workers

It’s time to actually help ALL Americans have better choices and lower health care premiums by working to fix the problems Democrats created with Obamacare.

H.R. ___, the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, sponsored by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, reforms our health care system by improving health care options, expanding choice for workers and families, lowering premiums for all Americans, and increasing transparency and competition in health care.

House Republicans will continue to fight to fix what Democrats broke and make health care more affordable and efficient for all Americans.

Streamlining Permitting to Boost Economic Development and Lower Energy Costs

The National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) is a federal law from 1969 that requires the assessment of potential environmental impacts before certain federal actions, including action on energy and infrastructure projects, can move forward. While originally intended to balance environmental concerns with economic development, the NEPA process has grown unreasonably and oppressively complex.

Drawn out NEPA review processes and constant legal battles significantly hinder critical energy production, infrastructure projects, forest management, and more across the country, stalling ready-to-go projects that could benefit Americans, create jobs, and lower costs.

By stalling energy production and projects, America’s permitting process is standing in the way of making sure Americans have access to reliable and affordable energy at a time when our energy demand is on the rise.

It is vital that we cut the burdensome bureaucracy and unnecessary litigation impeding energy infrastructure development and streamline permitting so America can get back to building, ensuring we have reliable access to the energy we need. Permitting reform presents a significant opportunity to foster economic growth, increased wages, and improved affordability for working families.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that reforms NEPA to simplify and streamline the permitting process, shortening timelines for permitting approvals, preventing frivolous lawsuits, and restoring NEPA to its intended scope.

H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, sponsored by Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, reforms the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) to streamline the permitting process and agency procedures by restricting NEPA lawsuits to parties impacted by a project, putting in place reasonable filing deadlines, and restoring NEPA to its original purpose and scope.

House Republicans are working to lower energy costs and establish global energy dominance – will Democrats join us, or instead vote to bring America closer to an energy crisis?

Supporting Reliable Power for Americans

Reliable and adequate delivery of electric power – a crucial aspect of Americans’ daily life – depends on our electric power grid, which consists of a complex network of generators, transmission lines, and distribution centers, and other crucial infrastructure.

As demand for reliable electric power increases with the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), American manufacturing, and general electrification, we are also seeing premature retirements of dispatchable and baseload power plants due to overly burdensome regulations pushed by radical liberals, threatening our ability to reliably deliver power across the country.

Over the past several years, radical state and federal environmental policies have limited production and increased compliance costs of more traditional and dependable dispatchable generation resources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear, while favoring renewables like wind and solar. The problem? Wind and solar are intermittent resources and can’t reliably meet our increasing electricity demand.

At a time when we need to be expanding production and increasing development for more reliable baseload and dispatchable power, these onerous regulations continue to encourage accelerated retirements of power plants. It’s past time we stop burdensome red tape that threatens the security and reliability of our power system.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that mandates that the North American Electric Reliability Corporation conduct annual assessments on electricity generation and grid reliability, and empowers the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to prevent any future rules that would hurt grid reliability

H.R. 3616, the Reliable Power Act, introduced by Rep. Troy Balderson, amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to assess regulations that may impact grid reliability before finalizing new rules.

House Republicans are continuing our work to keep the lights on for American workers and families, make energy affordable again, and protect our energy security.

Combatting Premature Retirements of Baseload Power Plants

Many baseload power plants are being forced to prematurely retire thanks to burdensome Democrat policies and state and federal regulations designed to replace baseload generation with intermittent wind and solar. Due to the growth of artificial intelligence data centers, domestic manufacturers, and general electrification, electricity demand is booming, placing strain on the American electric grid.

As these power plants close while power demands spike, America’s energy supply is left vulnerable, along with the millions of Americans who rely on it to keep their lights on. Additionally, the risk for rolling blackouts and brownouts increases.

Across the country, the states with the least affordable electricity are the same states with the most forceful “Green New Scam” standards. Unfortunately, as the grid spans across state lines, one state’s decision to prematurely close a power plant also impacts the reliability and affordability in neighboring states.

This week, House Republicans are bringing forward legislation that gives plants additional authority to contest their closure if it impacts the affected area’s ability to supply power and hurts electric reliability. Under Section 207 of the Federal Power Act, this important legislation would allow a Regional Transmission Organization or a state Public Utility Commission to request an order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to remain open and allocate costs until a reliable fix is implemented.

Rep. Morgan Griffith’s legislation, H.R. 3632, the Power Plant Reliability Act, addresses the premature retirements of baseload power plants by allowing states and regional operators to contest proposed closures on power plants in neighboring states if the closure could impact electric reliability and affordability.

House Republicans will continue working to keep the lights on for American families by allowing FERC to mitigate plant retirements and keep our bulk power system strong.

Vetting Unaccompanied Migrant Children and their Sponsors to Keep Communities Safe

In 2022, 20-year-old Kayla Hamilton was tragically and brutally murdered by Walter Javier Martinez. Martinez, a 17-year-old illegal migrant, was in the U.S. as an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC) and was released to a sponsor by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) without any background checks being completed.

Because proper background checks did not occur prior to his release, it wasn’t until later that authorities discovered Martinez – who was from El Salvador – had a criminal history and was affiliated with the MS-13 gang. He even confessed to having committed four murders and two rapes, as well as other crimes. In April, Martinez was sentenced to 70 years in prison.

Under the Biden Administration, the number of UACs crossing the border and being released into the U.S. reached all time highs: around 465,000 UACs were released to sponsors during President Biden’s time in office. Due to the surge, the previous administration relaxed safety procedures and protections, such as background checks and file reviews for children and sponsors, prioritizing placing UACs quickly versus placing them safely.

The failure to properly screen UACs and their sponsors incentivizes increased illegal border crossings, results in the trafficking and exploitation of UACs, and threatens the safety of innocent Americans like Kayla Hamilton.

Walter Javier Martinez should have never been released into our country, and Kayla Hamilton should still be here today. House Republicans are bringing legislation to ensure thorough background checks are conducted on UACs and potential sponsors before their placement, keeping Americans safe from dangerous UACs and protecting UACs from exploitation.

Rep. Russell Fry’s legislation, H.R. 4371, the Kayla Hamilton Act, requires HHS contact the consulate or embassy of a UAC’s home country to ascertain criminal history or gang affiliation for UACs aged 12 or older, requires background checks on potential UAC sponsors and adult members of their household, instructs HHS to screen for gang tattoos and place UACs with gang tattoos or ties in secure facilities, and prevents UAC placement with sponsors who are illegal immigrants.

House Republicans are working to keep dangerous criminals out of our communities and ensure American families are safe.

Correcting the Rosemont Decision and Supporting Critical Mining Projects

In May 2022, the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court decision repealing an approved plan for Rosemont Copper-Mine Project. This decision upended decades of precedent by prohibiting the long-standing practice of using adjacent lands for mining support activities like rock waste disposal or processing. This faulty decision is commonly referred to as the “Rosemont decision.”

This misguided and harmful decision threatens hardrock mining and critical mineral projects across Western states rich with minerals, such as Alaska, Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho, by forcing all ancillary mining operations to happen on mineral-rich lands.

These critical mineral projects are important to securing our manufacturing and energy futures, as well as decreasing our dependence on imports from foreign adversaries.

Now more than ever, we should be promoting mining operations and domestic energy production in states with rich mineral resources – not upending responsible mining projects and practices under the false guise of protecting the environment.

Rep. Mark Amodei’s legislation, H.R. 1366, the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, undoes the damaging Rosemont decision, allows mining operations to continue as they have historically under the law, and protects the communities and jobs supported by this industry.

House Republicans will continue working to secure essential mineral supply chains and responsibly harvest our abundant natural resources.

Ending Taxpayer Funding for Transgender Surgeries for Children

In May 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a report highlighting serious concerns about medical interventions to transition an individual away from their biological sex, including puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries, in children and adolescents. The HHS report highlighted significant and irreversible risks, such as infertility, that result from such interventions while noting weak evidence of benefit to the child.

These dangerous and irreversible medical interventions forever alter a person’s body and come with serious risks – and this is what far-left activists are pushing on our nation’s children.

This week, House Republicans are bringing legislation to protect children from irreversible, unproven, and life-altering procedures and treatments that are not medically necessary while also promoting fiscal responsibility.

Our legislation prohibits the use of Medicaid funding for gender transition procedures such as surgeries, hormone therapies, and puberty blockers intended to alter a minor’s biological sex while maintaining funding for medically necessary treatments for conditions including early puberty, genetic disorders, and life-threatening conditions.

Medicaid’s limited resources should not be used to permanently alter the body of a minor – these taxpayer dollars should only be used for scientifically-based and medically necessary care.

H.R. 498, the Do No Harm in Medicaid Act, sponsored by Rep. Dan Crenshaw, prevents federal Medicaid funding being used for gender transition procedures that are not medically necessary for individuals under 18 years old.

House Republicans are working to ensure hardworking Americans are not forced to pay for dangerous, irreversible gender transition procedures for minors.

Protecting America’s Children From Dangerous and Irreversible Gender Transition Treatments

In recent years, some U.S. medical institutions have begun pushing health care based in radical ideology when it comes to treating children.

Taking an “affirmation only” approach, these woke, so-called health care professions instruct doctors, parents, therapists and teachers to simply begin transitioning treatments like puberty-blockers, hormones, and more extreme procedures, instead of considering other potential contributing factors like mental health conditions.

The radical and politically-motivated “gender-affirming care” agenda can have devastating, irreversible effects on children, including infertility and mutilation from sex-change surgeries. It’s dangerous and ridiculous to allow a child who can’t vote or attend an R-rated movie to decide to permanently alter his or her body. House Republicans are bringing forward legislation to protect American children from dangerous gender transition treatments.

H.R. 3492, the Protect Children’s Innocence Act, sponsored by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, makes it a crime for doctors to perform genital or bodily mutilation or chemical castration sex-change procedures on minors.

House Republicans will always fight to protect our children from dangerous, politically-motived medical care that could harm them for life.

Delisting the Recovered Gray Wolf Species

Across the lower 48 states, the gray wolf species has clearly recovered from their once extremely endangered status. Recent scientific analysis has shown their population to be healthy and sustainable from a multitude of threats. As such, it is time for the species to be delisted and returned to state management.

In the Great Lakes region, which claims the largest concentration of gray wolves here in the lower 48 states, there are around 4,200 wolves, and the current population is well past delisting recovery goals. In fact, the delisting recovery goals for gray wolves “have been met since at least 1994,” according to Nathan Roberts, former wildlife biologist at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

Furthermore, the Obama, Trump, and Biden Administrations all took actions to delist the gray wolf: In 2013, the Obama Administration proposed delisting the species; in 2020, the Trump Administration published a rule removing the gray wolf as a protected species that was later vacated by a U.S. District Court; and most recently, the Biden Administration appealed the vacated Trump 2020 rule.

While the last three presidential administrations agreed that it is time to delist the gray world, activist judges and radical environmentalists continue to block the removal of the gray wolf from the endangered species list. We should be focusing on allocating resources and taxpayer dollars to species that need to recover, not keeping an already recovered species on the list.

Additionally, allowing the recovered gray wolf population to continue to grow completely protected and unchecked poses an immediate threat to livestock, farmers, pet owners, residents, and more.

Rep. Lauren Boebert’s legislation, H.R. 845, the Pet & Livestock Protection Act, would require the Secretary of the Interior to reissue regulations delisting the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List in the lower 48 states and ensure this decision is not subject to judicial review.

Building durable, effective energy policy demands a clear-eyed assessment of the barriers that have undermined smart policymaking and implementation.","12.15.25 | 26 min read | Text by Arjun Krishnaswami & Addy Smith & Diego Núñez & Megan Husted

The American power grid in 2025 faces a set of challenges unlike any in recent memory. The United States is deploying clean energy far too slowly to meet load growth, avoid spikes in electricity prices, and combat climate change. To get within striking distance of the Paris climate goals and plan for the lowest electricity costs, we must build 70 to 125 gigawatts of clean energy per year, much higher than the record 50 gigawatts built in 2024.

Grid upgrades, too, are proceeding far too slowly. To meet growing electricity demand and integrate new clean power at lowest cost, transmission capacity must more than double within regions and increase more than four-fold between regions by 2035. But large transmission projects frequently take 7 to 15 years from initial planning to in-service operation and only 322 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines were completed in 2024—the third slowest year of new construction in the last 15 years.

Even before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) gutted federal clean energy incentives, non-cost challenges like uncertain and lengthy interconnection and siting processes, local restrictions on development, and supply chain bottlenecks led to lower levels of clean energy deployment than projected and slowed down grid upgrades. Now, clean energy and transmission face additional cost and financing barriers from Congressional rollbacks and permitting restrictions from the Trump Administration.

Past federal and state clean energy policies, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) as well as state renewable portfolio standards, have leaned heavily on financial incentives to drive deployment and incentivize grid upgrades and expansion. These incentives successfully attracted massive investment in clean energy projects, but they largely did not grapple with non-cost challenges—like siting restrictions—to building projects.

Political challenges have made it difficult to pass, implement, and defend clean energy policies. A mismatch between public needs, government programs, and industry incentives has led to unsatisfactory outcomes and degraded public trust in the government.

Now, policymakers, industry, and the advocacy community are paying more attention to non-financial issues that can impede deployment, like siting and permitting. The abundance movement, for example, has identified two causes of America’s building problem: ineffective government programs and burdensome permitting processes. This diagnosis is incomplete. Getting to a world where we can build things quickly and make government work will require us to identify the full suite of problems, not just these convenient two.

To maximize clean energy deployment, we must address the project development barriers that slow down investment and construction. And to build more durable and effective energy policies, we must interrogate and address the political barriers that have held us back from smart policymaking and implementation that can withstand political change. Overcoming these challenges is necessary to address the climate crisis, rein in rising utility bills, and ensure that government can deliver on its energy promises to the public it serves.

In early 2025, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) set out to identify and categorize these barriers through research and interviews with experts and practitioners. Following this research, at the 2025 Climate Week NYC, FAS convened a group of researchers, advocates, industry leaders, and policymakers to solicit feedback on this framework.

The outcome of that convening allowed us to ground-truth the following report—which we intend to use as a rubric for state-level electricity policies and efforts to rethink federal energy policy. We should ask: to what extent do new policies under consideration reduce the major barriers to building clean energy and transmission while addressing the shortcomings that have made past policy less durable?

A future paper will detail the priority solutions that make progress on each of the project development barriers while improving our toolkit to overcome the political barriers that impede durable policy.

Project Development Barriers: Making it Harder to Build

Clean energy technologies are mature and cost competitive, if not least cost, across the country. Yet we are not building clean energy as fast as necessary, and in many places we are building new gas plants instead, raising costs for customers and intensifying the climate crisis. This trend is the result of several barriers that make it more difficult to build clean energy.

Interconnection

The Barrier

The interconnection process is one of the most significant constraints on clean energy deployment in the United States. At the end of 2023, nearly 2,600 gigawatts (GW) of generation and storage were queued, which is more than double the U.S. installed capacity (~1,280 GW). Today’s grid was built around a small number of large, centralized fossil fuel plants; the grid must now accommodate thousands of diverse, geographically distributed projects. Processes that were designed for a handful of large plants per year are now evaluating orders of magnitude more proposals, each with more complex grid interactions. These processes are not able to adequately handle the current grid, nor have they kept pace with development in grid planning and analysis tools. The result is a massive backlog of projects waiting to interconnect to the grid and a review system that is fundamentally misaligned with the scale and pace of the energy transition.

Developer experience confirms that interconnection challenges rank among the most decisive barriers to clean energy buildout. In the 2024 Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) developer survey, respondents ranked interconnection delays and network upgrade costs higher than permitting, supply chain constraints, or workforce shortages as reasons for project cancellations or deferrals. Many projects face cost uncertainty on the order of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars as interconnection studies shift responsibility for broad system upgrades onto single developers. Interconnection costs are rising, and it is difficult for developers to predict what their interconnection bill will be at the end of the process. This unpredictability increases financing risk, reduces developer participation, and leads to large-scale attrition.

Outdated processes for evaluating and approving new projects have led to enormous project delays, averaging 4-5 years from request to commercial operation. This delay has raised prices and led some grid operators to keep old, expensive coal plants online in lieu of new capacity. Both of these trends benefit incumbent transmission and generation companies, who have significant decision-making power over the entities that control interconnection, making it difficult to update the processes. Clean energy projects also face higher interconnection costs than gas projects because they are more likely to need transmission upgrades to connect to the grid, which increases the chances of project cancellation.

These barriers have direct system-wide consequences. Only about 15 to 20 percent of projects that enter the queue ultimately reach commercial operation, meaning most of the clean energy capacity counted as “planned” will not materialize unless interconnection processes are reformed. Long queue timelines and uncertainty also make it more difficult to finance projects. The result is slower emissions reductions, delayed IRA-driven investment and job creation, and higher costs for consumers as operators extend the life of aging coal and gas resources to meet growing load.

The Past Playbook

Federal interconnection policy has largely gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In 2023, FERC issued Order 2023, which made significant changes intended to speed up interconnection and increase certainty for new projects. The rule (1) replaced outdated serial studies, in which operators study projects one by one as their applications come in, with cluster studies, in which operators study projects in batches, (2) required grid operators to speed up study timelines and imposed penalties for failing to meet deadlines, and (3) directed grid operators to update rules to reflect technological advancements, like grid-enhancing technologies and hybrid solar-plus-storage projects. Some grid operators have gone further than Order 2023 to improve interconnection processes, and some states have pushed grid operators for more ambitious reform. In addition to FERC rules, the federal government has also provided limited resources to grid operators to improve interconnection processes.

To date, federal efforts have largely fallen short of what’s necessary to reform interconnection processes to enable adequate buildout of clean energy, and in most places states have limited tools. For one, FERC rules rely on effective implementation from grid operators, which has been a mixed bag. Order 2023 also strayed from making more fundamental changes to the interconnection process, like fixed entry fees that provide certainty to developers or proactive modeling and transparency of information to allow projects to connect quickly in places with transmission headroom. It fully does not address the fundamental problem that rising, variable interconnection costs are killing projects. The federal government has limited resources to support grid operators through, for example, funding for increased staffing or new technology to automate studies.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must radically transform the way we connect projects to the grid to enable faster, greater deployment of clean energy, including through an expanded role for federal and state governments. Policy must shorten study timelines using automation and other new technology, enable smarter planning with proactive modeling and greater transparency for developers, increase upfront cost certainty, and reduce the amount that projects end up paying for interconnection. And in addition, the next playbook must address governance and decision-making structures that favor incumbents who benefit from a congested grid.

Siting & Permitting

The Barrier

Siting and permitting processes have become two of the most visible friction points in the clean energy buildout. While federal policy receives the most attention, most clean energy siting and permitting decisions are made at the state and local level, where zoning boards, planning commissions, county supervisors, and community members have significant influence over whether a project proceeds. In many states, local jurisdictions have adopted new ordinances that restrict or outright ban wind, solar, and transmission development. According to recent analyses, roughly one-fifth of U.S. counties now have formal restrictions on clean energy, and many more are considering them. Even in states with strong climate and clean energy targets, municipal-level land use rules can effectively halt projects that align with statewide goals.

These local barriers are often rooted in concerns about landscape change, perceived impacts on property values, agricultural land use, wildlife, or community identity. But they are also a reflection of who benefits and who bears the immediate impacts of clean energy development. Benefits like lower system-wide electricity prices, cleaner air, and national decarbonization progress tend to be distributed widely, while the visual and land-use impacts are concentrated locally. Developers may not readily have the resources to meet community needs to come to agreement on projects, and federal and state governments often do not have adequate resources to support community benefits. Misinformation and disinformation—spread by incumbent interests who stand to lose money with greater clean energy or transmission deployment—also seed opposition in communities.

Permitting requirements add an additional layer of delay and uncertainty. Most clean energy projects, particularly solar and storage projects—which make up the bulk of new planned capacity—rarely trigger major federal environmental statutes and primarily deal with state-level permitting. Developers must navigate state statutes governing clean water, conservation, and environmental impacts, which serve important purposes but are often still implemented through outdated processes (e.g., many states still require paper permits; in Arizona, digitization reduced timelines for one permit process by 91 percent) administered by understaffed agencies. Projects such as transmission lines, offshore wind facilities, pumped storage hydropower, nuclear plants, geothermal projects, and any project on federal land or receiving federal grants generally must also navigate federal permitting processes. When new projects trigger federal review, they must comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and sometimes other federal permitting statutes, like the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the Endangered Species Act. These reviews can take multiple years, particularly when agencies have limited staffing or when studies must coordinate across several state and federal entities and jurisdictions.

Delays from local siting and state and federal permitting translate directly into cost escalation and canceled projects. Developers report that siting challenges can add years to development schedules and millions of dollars in carrying costs before a shovel ever hits the ground. For technologies like wind and solar, where the business model depends on tight capital cost margins, extended pre-construction periods can be the difference between a viable project and one that never breaks ground. Transmission development is even more exposed: large lines can spend a decade or more navigating route identification, landowner negotiations, environmental review, and litigation. Without new transmission capacity, interconnection backlogs grow, power costs increase, and states are forced to rely on older fossil resources simply because they are already in place.

Yet, the challenge isn’t so simple. It is not simply “local opposition” or “slow permitting.” It is that the scale of clean energy land use today is fundamentally different from the past century of centralized fossil energy development. We are building more projects, in more places, at a pace that communities have not previously experienced.

The Past Playbook

Siting and permitting reforms have increasingly been part of the federal and state policy agenda. Reforms have largely focused on process changes and improving coordination across agencies, with some focus on building capacity for analysis and review in some federal agencies and states. In general, these reforms are insufficient and not widespread enough to match the urgency and scale of the U.S. energy transition.

The federal government has pursued a range of reforms over the past few years to improve the permitting process for projects that involve federal land, funding, or regulatory triggers. Key cross-agency initiatives include the Coordinated Interagency Transmission Authorizations and Permits Program, which made the Department of Energy (DOE) the lead agency for coordinating environmental review and permitting for transmission lines, and FAST-41, which aims to align multiple agency reviews and reduce duplicative permitting processes. Agencies have taken additional steps to improve individual permitting processes. For example, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) designated solar and wind energy zones on public lands to reduce conflicts and expedite approvals, and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management modernized offshore wind leasing and programmatic NEPA reviews (although the Trump Administration overhauled these reforms by halting all offshore wind leasing).

Several states have attempted to reduce delays and uncertainty by centralizing siting authority and standardizing permitting rules. For example, New York’s Office of Renewable Siting and Massachusetts’ Energy Facilities Siting Board can override local opposition for large projects, while other states provide model ordinances to guide counties on setbacks, noise, and environmental protection. DOE has also helped states: the agency provided a small amount of technical assistance to states to help local governments with planning, siting, and permitting decisions and a larger tranche of funding for transmission projects to provide benefits to local communities to help with siting and community buy-in. In some places, these reforms have improved consistency across counties and reduced the influence of NIMBY-driven delays.

This playbook, while directionally correct, has fallen short of what is necessary. Local restrictions on clean energy continue to proliferate, siting power plants and large transmission lines remains a major challenge, and many state and federal permitting processes still pose significant barriers. Existing efforts have several gaps: (1) many states have not addressed local restrictions on development, (2) process improvements, especially at the state level, have happened in a piecemeal fashion and have not extended to the full suite of state-level permitting requirements, (3) existing efforts often do not cover the full set of solutions (e.g., broken permitting for customer-owned solar is a huge impediment that keeps U.S. solar costs much higher than other countries), (4) governments and developers have insufficient tools to ensure that local communities get what they want out of projects, and (5) efforts to increase state and federal government capacity (i.e., hiring and training the right staff and increasing analytical capabilities) have fallen far short of what is needed to have a fast, effective, and responsible permitting and siting process.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must wrestle with the fundamental siting and permitting challenges and introduce new frameworks for planning, permitting, and building projects. That means upfront planning to make major decisions about tradeoffs between clean energy, water, conservation, and other goals, expanding the tools and resources necessary to ensure that local communities benefit from projects, dramatically improving government capacity to do siting and permitting well, and taking a holistic approach across federal, state, and local governments to prevent new bottlenecks from emerging.

Misaligned Incentives

The Barrier

Most clean energy and grid upgrade projects are financed by private capital and procured or built by companies, either utilities or independent power producers. The profit motives of those financiers and companies determines the solutions they invest in, within the bounds of policy requirements. Across states and regions, outdated utility regulations and market designs have created flawed incentives that have limited investment in some necessary solutions and resulted in overinvestment in others. Utilities have wielded significant political power, built by lobbying with ratepayer money, to maintain today’s incentive structure.

For example, in vertically integrated states, utilities are incentivized to prioritize capital expenditures that earn them the highest returns, within the bounds of commission approval. This incentive structure deprioritizes solutions like increasing imports of clean energy through new transmission and leveraging distributed resources like customer-owned solar.

Most commissions are often not well-equipped or willing to ensure that utilities pursue the full toolkit. In most states, utility planning is driven by the utilities, who conduct detailed analysis and provide proposals on planning and ratemaking to their commissions. Commissions have more limited capacity to conduct analysis and interrogate utility proposals.

Organized markets also have flawed incentive structures. For example, incentive structures in organized markets were generally designed around an electricity grid made up of a small number of large power plants. As a result, market rules and incentive structures provide limited to no support for distributed energy resources, which makes it harder to finance these projects. Governance structures exacerbate this issue. In some organized markets, incumbent generators have significant decision-making power in important determinants of clean energy deployment, including interconnection and transmission planning. Some organized markets have maintained rules that make it difficult to connect new power plants.

Misaligned incentives reduce the effectiveness of other policy solutions. For example, tax credits to reduce the cost of clean energy projects are most effective if utility companies have a profit incentive to build those projects instead of other generation types. The effectiveness of bulk transmission grant programs is limited by the willingness of utility companies to collaborate on projects.

The Past Playbook

Federal policy has largely ignored utility incentive structures and instead attempted to influence private-sector behavior by working within existing incentive structures (e.g., by making it easier for utility companies to use tax credits to build clean energy). Federal agencies have attempted to overcome misaligned incentives through regulations (e.g., pollution standards on power plants that require generation owners to make changes). Some efforts to change incentives structures (e.g., the Clean Electricity Payment Program included in the 2021 Build Back Better Bill) have gained momentum but failed to pass.

Many states have also used tools that operate within existing incentive structures, like renewable portfolio standards that require utilities to procure an increasing share of their electricity from clean sources. States have attempted to change incentive structures to varying extents. More than 15 states have adopted some form of performance-based ratemaking to align utility incentives with desired outcomes. However, these efforts vary in how comprehensively they have changed the dominant incentives for companies.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must reform incentives to realign private sector interests with public benefit, including affordable bills, reliability, and decarbonization. To achieve the scale, speed, and depth of transformation needed to address the challenges facing our grid, policy must address misaligned incentives for distribution utilities, generation owners, and integrated utilities in different regulatory contexts. That requires a greater focus on realigning incentive structures at the state and regional level (through organized market reform) as well as creative federal tools to directly change incentives or help states and organized markets to do so. Increasing regulator scrutiny of utilities and bolstering capacity at commissions must also play a larger role moving forward to ensure that utilities are focusing on the best solutions, not just what is most profitable. Greater use of publicly owned or publicly financed projects can also ensure investment in solutions that are underutilized by private companies.

Financing

The Barrier

The federal government has created new financial barriers for clean energy projects. OBBBA’s changes to tax incentives and increased regulatory and permitting uncertainty make clean energy projects more expensive and harder to finance. Macroeconomic changes like persistent inflation and other uncertainty, including on tariffs and interest rates, have also affected investment.

While the clean energy industry has continued to move forward (2025 investment in solar, storage, and wind is similar to 2024 levels, and the industry is benefiting from demand growth, as many projects are able to find offtakers like tech companies willing to pay higher prices), the full effects of federal policy changes are likely delayed, as the tax credits have not fully expired. Moving forward, financing may become a larger barrier. In addition, rising utility bills have opened a conversation about the cost of private finance for grid projects and whether there are alternative approaches that come with lower costs for customers.

Financing less mature clean energy technologies, like advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal, and aggregated distributed generation (i.e., virtual power plants), remains a major issue.

The Past Playbook

Financial support has played a dominant role in the federal energy policy playbook. Tax incentives, which were dramatically expanded by the IRA and pared down by OBBBA, have been central to energy policy for decades. Grant and loan programs, also dramatically expanded by the IRA, have also been a core driver of clean energy deployment, grid upgrades, and large-scale demonstrations and commercialization of advanced energy technologies. States have also used tax incentives, grant programs, and green banks to finance and incentivize clean energy and grid projects. This model has largely been successful at deploying mature technologies like wind, solar, and storage, but it has fallen short when it comes to commercializing some newer clean energy technologies. Gaps also remain in financial support for projects that struggle to get private capital.

Where Do We Go From Here?

Financing and financial support should continue to be a major pillar of clean energy policy. The next era must incorporate a broader, more diverse set of financing tools in the capital stack, including state-led public financing for more types of projects and state efforts to create demand certainty for clean energy by leveraging procurement and working with corporate buyers.

Grid Planning

The Barrier

Today, the U.S. bulk transmission system faces significant constraints that limit where new clean energy projects can be built and threaten reliability. Congestion already causes curtailment of low-cost low-carbon power, higher consumer electricity prices, and dampened investment in clean energy. Many regions with abundant clean energy resources simply do not have enough high-voltage transmission capacity to deliver that power to population centers. As a result, developers are increasingly unable to move generation projects forward even when siting, permitting, financing, and interconnection queue positions are in place.

These challenges stem in large part from fragmented and inadequate planning processes. Coordinated planning is essential to ensure that transmission is expanded in the right places and that new clean energy investments flow to areas with sufficient transmission capacity. Despite the need for coordination, the United States conducts virtually no interregional transmission planning, and regional planning has been lacking in many regions. The result is piecemeal grid planning, as transmission providers and developers focus on smaller lines which meet near-term needs and are profitable within their own footprint. Planning for these smaller lines is easier as fewer parties are involved. Where we have successfully built larger regional lines, they are the result of transmission providers conducting robust planning processes. And because no unified authority or planning framework exists to shepherd large, high-impact projects across regions, the U.S. has built essentially zero major interregional transmission lines in recent history.

Lack of coordination between transmission and generation planning also creates inefficiencies and prevents smart development. In deregulated markets (and some vertically integrated states), transmission and generation planning processes occur largely in isolation without systematic processes to align long-term clean energy expansion with major grid upgrades.

Together, these gaps make expanding the transmission system an inefficient process at best, and an unworkable process at worst, at precisely the moment when the need for additional capacity is growing most rapidly.

The Past Playbook

Policymakers have made progress in addressing transmission planning bottlenecks, but these reforms remain far short of what’s needed. FERC Order 1920 is the most significant recent step: it requires long-term, forward-looking, multi-value regional planning. It was designed to improve transparency in the planning stages and help regions identify beneficial projects earlier. Yet the rule stops at regional borders and thereby doesn’t meaningfully advance interregional planning.

A patchwork of state and regional efforts has emerged alongside federal reforms. New Mexico created a new entity called the Renewable Energy Transmission Authority to map and finance new lines. Similarly, Colorado created the Colorado Electric Transmission Authority to plan and develop transmission lines to meet power needs, unlock clean energy, and lower costs. California conducts long-term transmission planning intended to incorporate transmission needs to accommodate clean energy deployment required to meet the state’s climate goals. Federal tools like National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETCs) were designed to accelerate siting of critically important lines, and part of DOE’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) funding has helped bring utilities, states, and developers together to plan large projects. On the interregional front, DOE has conducted analysis to demonstrate where new capacity would create the greatest benefits and inform planning.

These efforts certainly make progress and will likely result in expansion of local and regional transmission capacity. The magnitude of progress will depend in large part on how transmission providers implement Order 1920—for most regions, compliance filings will be submitted this month (December 2025) or by June 2026.

However, this playbook had significant gaps and pitfalls. Lack of interregional planning is the most glaring gap, but other tools had limitations, too. GRIP had limited funding and power to solve cost allocation disputes. NIETCs did not translate into built infrastructure. In many places transmission planning will not take into account the long-term clean energy expansion required for deep decarbonization, leaving high-value opportunities—like pairing wind resources with long-distance transmission—unrealized. The result is a set of reforms that move in the right direction but still fall short.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must tackle interregional planning, while following through on Order 1920 with effective implementation. We must require transmission providers to plan decisively for futures with significant load growth and levels of clean energy deployment necessary for deep decarbonization. Future federal policy must also expand the government’s tools to bring parties to the table for smart, effective planning. In parallel, states should continue to use creative policies, like Colorado and New Mexico’s transmission authorities, to strategically plan new transmission lines to maximize benefits. And the next era must also include national, forward-looking land-use planning for clean energy deployment, in sync with transmission planning.

Supply Chains

The Barrier

Grid components, such as electrical steel and transformers, are necessary to increase grid capacity to support additional generation and load. However, grid component supply chains are still suffering from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of domestic manufacturing capacity. The rising demand for grid components and battery technology have further stressed supply chains, drawing out lead times and increasing prices. For example, across transmission and distribution equipment, the lead time for components averaged 38 weeks in 2023, nearly double from the year prior, with costs escalating nearly 30 percent year-over-year. Bottlenecks in the supply chains from upstream suppliers to manufacturers among these components risk power system stability, the ability to deploy clean energy, and the ability to build new industrial production and technology facilities at scale.

The Past Playbook

Federal policy has increasingly focused on building secure supply chains for clean energy technologies. The IRA included tax credits, grant programs, and loan authority to build out domestic supply chains for clean energy and storage technologies. The federal government has also used demand-side pressure to bolster supply chains (e.g., through a bonus tax incentive for clean energy projects that use domestic content and Build America Buy America requirements on federal grant programs). These policies led to major investment in domestic supply chains.

This playbook was quite successful at building out domestic supply chains for some industries, but it had major gaps. For example, the IRA and BIL included no dedicated support for grid components, and the minimal support that was embedded in larger programs was insufficient. Federal demand-side programs were structured as incentives for downstream industries to use domestic content, but this design had too much uncertainty to sufficiently derisk upstream domestic supply chains.

Today’s programs have also struggled to respond quickly when conditions change. For example, the federal government had limited tools with which to respond when the utility industry faced a debilitating shortage of large power transformers or when it became clear that incentives were not large enough to drive domestic investment for some clean energy components.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must build on the same financial tools to support secure supply chains that enable clean energy deployment and grid upgrades. The playbook must include policies that more directly create demand for domestic components to provide certainty for manufacturers and derisk new investments. Future policy must also provide more flexible and dynamic tools to rapidly address supply chain shortages as they arise.

Political Barriers: Making it Harder to Pass, Implement, and Defend Policy

Clean energy advocates have focused on economic competitiveness, climate, and public health benefits as the winning messages to support and defend policies. The BIL and IRA came out of this model, and the architects of those policies hoped that the industry that benefitted from these policies would step up to defend them. While this strategy has enabled passage of significant new policies, it has failed to withstand changing political dynamics. The swift rollback of major parts of BIL and IRA is the prime example. Our ability to successfully implement and defend clean energy policies—and make further progress—has been hampered by several key political barriers. The next era of clean energy policy must address these barriers to be successful.

Energy Affordability

The Barrier

Rapidly rising utility bills have become an urgent cost-of-living issue. People pay 13 percent more for electricity in 2025 than they did in 2022, and nearly 40 percent of households sometimes have to choose between paying for food and medicine or keeping the lights on.

Rising electricity prices are a political barrier to some clean energy policies. For example, states have struggled to follow through on procurement of advanced clean energy technologies like nuclear and offshore wind as prices have risen. New York recently cancelled a planned transmission line, using affordability as a justification. Clean energy opponents are using prices to oppose climate policies, even though deployment of wind and solar has generally reduced rates. Concerns about electricity affordability make it difficult to justify major grid infrastructure investments under current regulatory and ratemaking structures, as additional spending to update the grid will lead to near-term bill increases. High prices also make it difficult to replace direct fossil fuel use in vehicles, buildings, and factories with electricity.

The Past Playbook

Federal energy policy has largely dealt with affordability in two ways.

First, the federal government has provided important but limited direct assistance to struggling households through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps households pay for energy, and the Weatherization Assistance Program, which funds energy- and cost-saving home improvements. However, these programs are significantly underfunded and oversubscribed—many households that need support do not get it.

Second, federal financial support results in long-term savings. IRA incentives for low-cost clean energy were projected to reduce generation costs, which in the long term translates to lower prices. Tax incentives and grant programs for distributed energy resources and home energy improvements save energy and costs for customers that make upgrades. However, this approach falls short in two ways: (1) it does not address the root causes of rising electricity bills, which means bills will continue to rise, and (2) the benefits are long term and do not show up on peoples’ bills on politically relevant timelines.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of energy policy must provide sufficient and swift relief for customers that are on the edge of catastrophe due to rising costs, make it easier to deploy cheap, clean energy to reduce generation costs, and target the root causes of high and rising bills to unlock a sustainable utility ratemaking regime that allows for major new investments in the grid without harming regular people. The new playbook must also include more effective cross-sector tools to cut total system and household costs, including by transferring planned spending on gas infrastructure to home electrification and grid upgrades where possible.

Incumbent Interests

The Barrier

Many solutions, including adding new generation in organized markets, relying more on regional and interregional transmission, and deploying distributed and demand-side solutions, threaten the profits of incumbent interests under current market and regulatory structures. For example, utilities make money through a return on qualified capital investments in things like power plants and distribution infrastructure. Increasing bulk transmission capacity to connect the Southeast with other regions would lead to more imports of lower cost clean energy, which would reduce the utilities’ reliance on local generation. That makes it harder for the utilities to justify capital expenditures in new power plants, which is how the utilities make a profit, so new transmission poses a threat to the business model. As a result, Southeastern utilities are opposed to policies that would expand bulk transmission to better connect different regions, even though these policies would reduce costs and increase reliability. These dynamics make it politically difficult to pursue policies that expand transmission capacity.

The Past Playbook

Federal clean energy policy has largely avoided changing incumbent incentive structures or decision-making processes at the state and regional level. Instead, policymakers have used financial incentives to bring incumbents to the table and increase their investment in clean energy and grid upgrades. As a result, the misaligned incentives described above, combined with decision-making structures that reward incumbents over innovation, make it difficult to fully address the barriers to clean energy deployment and grid upgrades at the necessary scale.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of clean energy policy must address governance issues through reform of regional grid operators and public utility commissions. Strengthening the role of regulators is critical to reining in incumbent interests where they do not align with public benefit. It must also realign industry incentives (e.g., through performance-based ratemaking) where possible with affordability and decarbonization goals.

Delayed Impact

The Barrier

Another major political barrier is the lengthy time it takes to get from enactment and implementation to tangible benefits for people. Transforming major sectors of the economy is a time-intensive, multi-stage project, and climate advocates have accordingly focused on long-term goals, such as 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 or net-zero emissions by 2050. The IRA and BIL were made up primarily of multi-year (even some decadal) programs to drive major changes in the economy. As a result, the largest benefits were projected to come in the late 2020s and early 2030s, far outside the window of political memory. That mismatch makes it difficult for the public to understand the point of policies and in turn makes those policies hard to defend.

Where policies do have near-term benefits, those benefits have often been delayed by the implementation process. Successfully shifting the private sector requires precise policy and new programs, which take time to implement. Implementation of new programs can also run up against the government typically works, and that friction causes delays. Implementation delays make it difficult to connect the dots between policy and tangible improvements to peoples’ lives.

The Past Playbook

Policymakers have used three dominant approaches to overcoming this barrier. First, they tout near-term signs of economic change. For example, the Biden administration consistently cited private-sector investment in clean energy as a key metric to convince the public that the IRA and BIL were driving benefits for people. Second, they rely on the quickest economic changes to demonstrate impact. For example, the IRA and BIL drove a near-term increase in construction jobs. Real and announced job creation was the dominant message to support and defend these policies. Third, they cite projected benefits. For example, the Biden administration frequently cited the 1.5 million jobs and the $27 to $33 billion in energy cost savings that the IRA was projected to drive.

Attention to long-term impact is important for addressing long-term problems like climate change and load growth. However, politics runs on instant gratification. As of late 2024, only 39 percent of Americans had heard of the IRA. And federal energy policy failed to make a near-term dent in the issue that was most visible for people: utility bills.

Where Do We Go From Here?

The next era of clean energy policy must tangibly and visibly benefit people in the short term. The playbook must include a better balance of policies geared toward long-term transformation of the economy and policies focused on pressing issues for regular people. That means including programs that are designed for quick implementation and real-world change.

Conclusion: What’s Next?

The power sector sits at an inflection point. The challenges facing the grid are immediate, interconnected, and solvable but only if we confront the real sources of delay and dysfunction. Accelerating clean energy deployment requires moving beyond our old playbook—dominated by financial incentives and regulations that see-saw based on the political winds—toward a new approach that addresses both project development barriers that slow investment and construction and political barriers that impede durable policymaking. Building durable, effective energy policy demands a clear-eyed assessment of the barriers that have undermined smart policymaking and implementation.

In a forthcoming publication, we will move from diagnosis to action, detailing policy solutions that can unlock faster, more reliable project development while expanding the policy toolkit needed to overcome the political barriers that have prevented durable reform. Together, these solutions aim to strengthen grid reliability, rein in rising utility bills, and put the United States back on a credible path to decarbonization. These stakes could not be higher, and the opportunity to build a more affordable, resilient, and clean energy system has never been more urgent.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/1212-barrier-report.png,N,,2025-12-15 11:02:48.307643

The talent is not here, and the automotive companies take all the air out of the room.”","With Michigan’s signature industry undergoing rapid transformation, from tariffs and shifting fuel economy standards to the accelerated growth of Chinese competitors, the message is clear: Michigan cannot expect to win the future of the industry solely through legacy.

On Dec. 10, MichAuto investors, partners, and government officials came together for a critical conversation on the global forces of change and innovation impacting Michigan’s automobility industry.

During the event, MichAuto released the State of Automobility report, which identifies the forces of change shaping its future, weaknesses that threaten global leadership, and strengths that reinforce it.

2025 reshaped Michigan’s automobility industry in ways few could have imagined, making it the year when the unexpected became the norm. When asked to name the most unexpected thing that occurred in 2025, Tu Le mentioned the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement getting “blown up.”

Daniel Howes described another unexpected turn Michigan faced in 2025: a strategic reversal in the automotive industry. With EV incentives being taken away, the industry has begun to pull back, drifting away from the global stage.

“When I first started covering as a beat writer at General Motors, one of the reasons I was so blown away by the opportunities was that they were everywhere,” Howes said. “Now they’ve retreated to only places where they make a profit.”

Lastly, Elizabeth Krear pointed to another unexpected turn Michigan faced in 2025: the significant rollback of emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations.

“Growing up as an engineer in the industry, we lived and breathed those policies,” she reflected on.

These policies have long provided clear targets, especially in guiding the EV transition. With their reversal, however, the industry across California, Europe, and China is now forced to rethink its strategies, shifting from policy-driven benchmarks to a landscape where customers themselves set the pace.

Although Michigan is a major player in the global automotive industry, we may not be ready to keep up with the industry’s rapidly increasing pace. Chinese companies are moving so fast that GM and Ford Motor Company have relied on China for building hybrid vehicles. China isn’t just a competitor; it’s become the global hub for auto manufacturing and exports.

“When it comes to dealing and talking with the tier ones and the OEMs, quite often it’s culture and management that needs to change, and the speed at which things happen, and decisions are made,” Le said. “Right now, a Chinese company can go from clean sheet to job one in 18 months.”

Another way to assess whether Michigan’s signature industry is ready to compete globally is to examine affordability and consumer behavior. The industry can’t rely on old consumer habits. Rising prices and shifting demand mean Michigan’s automakers must stay flexible.

“This year in 2025, we saw an uptick in SUVs and large trucks,” Krear said. “However, these are not the type of vehicles that the U.S. consumer would currently buy.”

In light of the unexpected turns Michigan faced in 2025, Krear emphasized the importance of partnerships as a critical asset heading into 2026. As technology advances, collaborations between OEMs and suppliers are becoming increasingly prominent, with Volkswagen teaming up with Rivian and LG Energy partnering with GM.

As Michigan also enters a pivotal election year, what kind of leadership and conversations will be required to drive meaningful change? Reflecting on three decades of covering issues related to talent retention and educational attainment, Howes noted that these issues have not shown significant improvement and emphasized the need for honest, nonpartisan dialogue.

“When it has gotten materially better, it hasn’t hung on to the gains,” he said. “While we live in a partisan age, partisanship is not the answer because it wasn’t the answer in Detroit.”

Closing out what to look forward to in 2026, Le also expressed his concerns about our area not being as welcoming to new companies like Waymo.

“If we’re supposed to be the global epicenter of mobility and not automotive … why aren’t these companies here?” Le asked. “Because they don’t feel welcome. The talent is not here, and the automotive companies take all the air out of the room.”",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ld-day-at-the-capitol-ld-photo-gallery-3-24.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:59:59.222424

The Renewable Energy Certificate Market is gaining notable traction as governments, corporations, and power producers intensify efforts to meet renewable energy targets and compliance obligations, according to Ameco Research. The Renewable Energy Certificate Market forecasts point to sustained expansion over the next decade, underpinned by increasing renewable generation capacity, regulatory mandates, and voluntary corporate sustainability commitments.

According to Ameco Research, the global renewable energy certificate (REC) market is experiencing robust growth, with valuations and future projections in 2024 between approximately USD 15 billion and USD 28 billion, with substantial upside potential in long-term forecasts. In terms of certificates issued, the Renewable Energy Certificate Market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 20.2% from 2021 to 2028, with 2,175,813 certificates issued in 2020 and 9,298,511 certificates issued by 2028.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Growth Forecast

• CAGR Prediction (2021-2028): The Renewable Energy Certificate market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~20.2% during 2021-2028.

• Certificates Issued in 2020: Approximately 2,175,813 MWh (or certificates) were issued globally in 2020.

• Certificates Estimated by 2028: Forecasts project that certificate issuance could reach around 9,298,511 MWh by 2028 — indicating strong expansion in renewable generation and certification activity.

What Are Renewable Energy Certificates?

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are tradable instruments representing the environmental attributes of one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated from renewable resources. RECs serve as a mechanism for utilities, corporations, and other power consumers to demonstrate compliance with renewable portfolio standards (RPS) or support voluntary green energy goals.

By separating the renewable attribute from the physical electricity, RECs enable market participants to purchase the environmental value of renewable energy even when they cannot directly source clean power from the grid.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Drivers

Several factors are contributing to the accelerating growth of the renewable energy certificate market:

Regulatory Mandates and Policy Frameworks

National and regional renewable energy targets, including RPS programs in North America and the EU's stringent climate policies, continue to drive demand for RECs as compliance instruments. These programs compel utilities and energy users to source a defined share of power from renewable sources, boosting REC issuance and trading activity.

Corporate Sustainability Initiatives

More corporations are setting net-zero and carbon-neutral goals. RECs are an essential tool for companies seeking to credibly claim renewable energy use across operations, particularly in jurisdictions where direct renewable procurement remains challenging.

Increasing Renewable Capacity

Global renewable electricity generation — led by solar and wind — continues to grow rapidly as countries expand low-carbon infrastructure. This expansion naturally supports higher REC issuance, underpinning market liquidity and trading volumes.

Market Liberalization and Technology Integration

Developments in blockchain and digital tracking technologies are improving transparency and efficiency in REC markets, reducing fraud and transaction friction.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Regional Outlook

North America remains a significant force, driven by regulatory frameworks such as Renewable Portfolio Standards and corporate renewable procurement programs. The region's REC market has been one of the most dynamic, supported by robust renewable deployment and demand for compliance instruments.

Europe's REC market is buoyed by comprehensive climate targets and initiatives like the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which aim to increase renewable penetration and emissions reductions across member states.

Asia-Pacific is emerging as a high-growth region, propelled by rapid renewable capacity additions in China, Japan, and Australia. Policy reforms and investment in renewable infrastructure are accelerating REC market development.

Other emerging markets in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa are gaining traction, particularly where governments and utilities are adopting renewable targets and incentive schemes.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Trends: Compliance vs. Voluntary Markets

The REC market can broadly be segmented into compliance and voluntary categories:

• Compliance RECs are driven by legal or policy mandates. Utilities and power suppliers must purchase or produce a share of renewable generation, stimulating demand for compliance certificates.

• Voluntary RECs are acquired by corporations and consumers seeking to demonstrate a commitment to sustainability beyond regulatory requirements.

Both segments are expanding, with compliance markets often offering steady base demand while voluntary markets introduce flexibility and broader participation from non-utility entities.

Challenges and Market Resilience

Despite strong growth projections, the REC market faces challenges:

• Policy and Regulatory Complexity: Differences in REC definitions, tracking systems, and cross-border recognition can complicate market participation.

• Price Volatility: REC prices can fluctuate based on supply dynamics, policy changes, and variations in compliance requirements.

• Integration with Power Markets: Aligning REC trading with energy market operations and physical generation profiles remains technically complex.

Nevertheless, ongoing policy refinement and technological innovation continue to enhance market robustness and investor confidence.

Renewable Energy Certificate Market Future Outlook

The renewable energy certificate market is positioned for sustained expansion, driven by global decarbonization efforts, the proliferation of renewable generation, and the growing integration of RECs into corporate sustainability strategies. As governments tighten clean energy mandates and companies ramp up renewable commitments, RECs will remain a pivotal component of the energy transition toolkit.

Given the breadth of growth projections — from mid-range forecasts targeting tens of billions by 2030 to long-term estimates exceeding USD 180 billion by the mid-2030s — stakeholders anticipate that REC markets will evolve into deeper, more liquid, and globally harmonized platforms supporting renewable energy growth worldwide.

,American Energy,2025-12-15 14:02:58+00:00,Center for Progressive Reform,"Even with Trump's Support, Coal Power Remains Expensive — and Dangerous",Brian Gumm,,,,,https://progressivereform.org/cpr-blog/even-with-trumps-support-coal-power-remains-expensive-and-dangerous/,"He also directed federal agencies to “identify coal resources on Federal lands” and ease the process for leasing and mining coal on those lands.
But coal mining remains a hazardous job.
There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods.
Limits remain Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, coal is more expensive than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising.
This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.","This commentary was originally published on The Conversation. It is reprinted under Creative Commons license CC BY-ND 4.0.

As projections of U.S. electricity demand rise sharply, President Donald Trump is looking to coal – historically a dominant force in the U.S. energy economy – as a key part of the solution.

In an April 2025 executive order, for instance, Trump used emergency powers to direct the Department of Energy to order the owners of coal-fired power plants that were slated to be shut down to keep the plants running.

He also directed federal agencies to “identify coal resources on Federal lands” and ease the process for leasing and mining coal on those lands. In addition, he issued orders to exclude coal-related projects from environmental reviews, promote coal exports and potentially subsidize the production of coal as a national security resource.

But there remain limits to the president’s power to slow the declining use of coal in the U.S. And while efforts continue to overcome these limits and prop up coal, mining coal remains an ongoing danger to workers: In 2025, there have been five coal-mining deaths in West Virginia and at least two others elsewhere in the U.S.

A long legacy

Until 2015, coal-fired power plants generated more electricity than any other type of fuel in the U.S. But with the rapid expansion of a new type of hydraulic fracturing, natural gas became a cheap and stable source for power generation. The prices of solar and wind power also dropped steadily. These alternatives ultimately overcame coal in the U.S. power supply.

Before this change, coal mining defined the economy and culture of many U.S. towns – and some states and regions, such as Wyoming and Appalachia – for decades. And in many small towns, coal-related businesses, including power plants, were key employers.

Coal has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a reliable fuel source for electricity that can be piled up on-site at power plants without needing a tank or underground facility for storage.

But it’s dirty: Thousands of coal miners developed a disease called black lung. The federal government pays for medical care for some sick miners and makes monthly payments to family members of miners who die prematurely. Burning coal also emits multiple air pollutants, prematurely killing half a million people in the United States from 1999 through 2020.

Coal is dangerous for workers, too. Some coal-mining companies have had abysmal safety records, leading to miner deaths, such as the recent drowning of a miner in a sudden flood in a West Virginia mine. Safety reforms have been implemented since the Big Branch Mine explosion in 2010, and coal miner deaths in the U.S. have since declined. But coal mining remains a hazardous job.

A champion of coal

In both of his terms, Trump has championed the revival of coal. In 2017, for example, Trump’s Department of Energy asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to pay coal and nuclear plants higher rates than the competitive market would pay, saying they were key to keeping the U.S. electricity grid running. The commission declined.

In his second term, Trump is more broadly using powers granted to the president in emergencies, and he is seeking to subsidize coal across the board – in mining, power plants and exports.

At least some of the urgency is coming from the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence, which the Trump administration champions. Many individual data centers use as much power as a small or medium city. There’s enough generation capacity to power them, though only by activating power plants that are idle most of the time and that operate only during peak demand periods. Using those plants would require data centers to reduce their electricity use during those peaks – which it’s not clear they would agree to do.

So many data centers, desperate for 24/7 electricity, are relying on old coal-fired power plants – buying electricity from plants that otherwise would be shutting down.

Limits remain

Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to rapidly expand data centers and coal to power them, coal is more expensive than most other fuels for power generation, with costs still rising.

Half of U.S. coal mines have closed within the past two decades, and productivity at the remaining mines is declining due to a variety of factors, such as rising mining costs, environmental regulation and competition from cheaper sources. Coal exports have also seen declines in the midst of the tariff wars.

The U.S. Department of the Interior’s recent effort to follow Trump’s orders and lease more coal on federal lands received only one bid – at a historically low price of less than a penny per ton. But in fact, even if the government gave its coal away for free, it would still make more economic sense for utilities to build power plants that use other fuels. This is due to the high cost of running old coal plants as compared to new natural gas and renewable infrastructure.",https://cpr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/uploads/2023/03/coal-power-plant-water.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:03:18.154211

Despite rising EV adoption across much of the world, particularly in Europe and China, the report highlights an overall softening in EV demand – with some consumers shifting to buy an ICE car as their next vehicle.

With EV charging infrastructure remaining one of the top concerns for potential EV buyers, this report highlights just how important the continued rollout of infrastructure will be to ensure mass EV adoption.

How close are we to mass EV adoption across the globe?

This new report from EY takes a global look at car buying intent, and finds that on a global scale, EV purchase intent has fallen – with 14% of consumers intending to buy a fully-electric car in the next 24 months, down from 24% when the survey was ran in 2024. This can partly be attributed to a number of key policy changes around the world, such as the United States’ recent removal of EV tax credits.

The report also looked, on a global scale, at what consumers perceive to be the top barriers for choosing an EV as their next car over an ICE. The number one concern was range anxiety, voiced by 29% of potential buyers. This is despite the fact that EVs entering the market have higher quoted battery ranges than ever before – over 250 miles is quickly becoming the industry standard, whilst ranges of up to 400 miles, previously the reserve of the most expensive EVs on the market, are now becoming a reality on relatively more affordable electric cars – the 492 mile Mercedes-Benz CLA being a case in point. With improvements in EV technology moving at such a rapid rate, there is a clear disconnect between the range modern EVs are actually capable of and what consumers believe they are, which needs to be addressed through stronger marketing messages.

The other key concerns mentioned were a ‘lack of charging infrastructure’ and ‘battery replacement costs’, both voiced by 28% of respondents. When it comes to charging infrastructure, the number of charge points continues to grow globally, even in countries with less favourable EV policies such as the US, so ensuring that consumers know that the infrastructure is available when they switch is a key communication to be made. When it comes to battery replacement costs, OEMs are already in the process of quelling this worry, most recently seen with BYD’s extension to its Blade battery warranty – which now covers the battery for eight years or 250,000 kilometres (155,000 miles).

Despite an uphill struggle for manufacturers to convince first-time EV buyers, the report also makes clear that once people make the switch to EV, the vast majority stick with it. Whilst only 5% of global ICE owners are considering a BEV for their next car, for current BEV owners globally, a majority 78% of them plan to stick with a BEV for their next car purchase. Therefore, getting car buyers into their first time EV is crucial to drive EV adoption in the years and decades to come.

We reached out to ChargeUK, the industry voice for the UK public charging industry, for further comment on what these statistics mean for the UK specifically, where EV adoption and charge point rollout has continued to grow at a strong rate.

Vicky Read, Chief Executive of ChargeUK, commented on the report:

“This study is light on specific data for the UK, but it does show that of all major markets ours has the lowest number of potential EV buyers reconsidering. This tallies with other studies such as PwC’s recent ‘eReadiness’ survey which found the UK’s drivers are more open to EVs than they were last year.

It is interesting to see that range anxiety and access to charging have steadily decreased as concerns for several years but picked up this year. I suspect that this may not be the case in the UK where the sector has been busy building some of the best and most widespread public charging infrastructure in the world. Though there can be a gap between reality and perception, and moving forward on education and visibility through things like official signage would be useful in the UK market.”",https://electricdrives.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ev-infrastructure-procurement.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:02:52.374086

Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts.","Massive cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have hampered state-level regulators’ ability to rein in pollution, according to a new report. And now, with the Trump administration pushing for even deeper cuts at the agency in 2026, many states across the country may be in a dire position.

“If EPA’s capacity to do its job is further diminished, how prepared are our states to shoulder more responsibility for protecting us from these threats? Unfortunately, not well,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), the nonprofit behind the report, said in a Wednesday press conference on the findings.

The report found that 27 state governments have cut environmental agency funding over the past 15 years, including seven states — Texas, Wyoming, Iowa, Alabama, Connecticut, South Dakota, and Mississippi — that have cut budgets by a third or more. And 31 states cut staff totals at their environmental agencies, collectively eliminating 3,725 roles in that same period.

That leaves them vulnerable to Trump administration changes at the EPA, which has already seen its budget cut 40 percent between 2010 and 2025. In 2025 alone, EPA staffers have left in droves, thanks to mass firings, layoffs, and resignations — as much as 33 percent of its total staff, according to some estimates. Meanwhile, the White House has proposed cutting the agency’s budget by 55 percent in 2026 to $4.2 billion, its lowest level of funding in four decades.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has suggested that states will be able to pick up the slack, describing a vision for the agency that involves giving “power back to states to make their own decisions.” In a March press conference announcing a major deregulation initiative — what he called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen” — Zeldin fundamentally recast EPA’s mission, outlining a new mandate to “unleash American energy” and “revitalize the American auto industry.”

Protecting Americans from the impacts of industry pollution, he suggested, would instead fall to state agencies, which are “best positioned to work with unique communities and implement laws.”

“In too many instances and across too many administrations, EPA has retained control of implementing many laws from its perch in the nation’s capital,” he said, in an address to the Environmental Council of the States, a national nonprofit organization representing environmental agency leaders, later that month. “It’s this kind of common sense reform I want to partner with states to achieve.”

In its report, EIP argues that this stance ignores EPA’s statutorily defined mission to protect the health and well-being of Americans, while downplaying the crucial role it plays in outlining national standards and coordinating efforts related to complex, multi-state problems. Even more significantly, though, according to the report, many states are simply not equipped to address their challenges without a strong federal partner.

“This kind of handoff — from federal to state — can only work if the teammate receiving the baton has not been hobbled, as many state environmental agencies have been, by budget cuts,” the report’s authors write.

Twenty three states have in fact worked to increase environmental funding since 2010 — with California (364 percent increase), Colorado (111 percent increase), and Vermont (109 percent increase) leading the way. Which means future cuts to the EPA would likely have a disproportionate impact on states like Mississippi and South Dakota, which have cut agency funding by 71 percent and 61 percent, respectively.

In the Wednesday press conference convened by EIP, environmental advocates painted a broad picture of state-level regulatory dysfunction that would only be made worse by further federal cuts.

The proposed cuts are “a recipe for disaster in states like ours, where the state agency is already stretched thin,” Drew Ball, southeast campaigns director for the National Resources Defense Council of North Carolina, where environmental agency funding had already declined 32 percent since 2010, said at EIP’s news conference.

“It’s like dismantling the fire department while the house is already burning.”

States depend on a variety of EPA grants to help fund their compliance efforts, ensuring that standards under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other laws are met. The Trump administration has proposed cutting EPA “categorical grants” by approximately $1 billion, eliminating nearly all federal funding for a range of issues, from air quality management and pollution control to brownfield management and lead abatement.

That recommendation would “devastate economic development, critical infrastructure, and environmental protections across the nation,” representatives from the Environmental Council of the States wrote in an open letter to Zeldin in May.

In the Wednesday press conference, Kathryn Guerra of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group, said her state of Texas already suffers from widespread regulatory noncompliance. According to its own enforcement reports, she said, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) never investigates many of the environmental complaints it receives, while its backlog of unresolved enforcement cases has grown to over 1,400.

“The funding cuts to TCEQ described in this report render the agency largely ineffective, and cuts to the EPA will worsen that ineffectiveness,” she said.

Meanwhile, both houses of Congress are recommending much less severe EPA cuts. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended cutting the agency’s budget by 23 percent in 2026, while its counterpart in the Senate has voted for just a 5 percent reduction. But the advocates convened by EIP argued that current levels of funding are already critically low.

“This report is a warning,” said Jennifer Walling, chief executive officer for the Illinois Environmental Council. “If both lines of defense, our state agencies and the U.S. EPA are weakened at the same time, pollution enforcement will falter, emergencies will happen, and public health will suffer. We cannot pretend that states are prepared to shoulder this burden alone.”",https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/media.nationofchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15054327/2.-CorpusChristie-1024x655-1.jpg.avif,N,,2025-12-15 09:59:49.243711

Over the years, conditions along Sage Creek have deteriorated due to fire, flooding, prolonged drought and other land use issues.","By working with nature, communities across the country are improving water quality and rebuilding critical habitat

Across the country, communities are discovering that some of the most effective solutions to today’s environmental challenges come from working with nature rather than against it. From the shifting deltas of coastal Louisiana to the high-desert streams of Wyoming, restoration efforts show that when we support natural processes—rather than replace or restrain them—we can rebuild vital landscapes, strengthen community resilience and create long-term environmental and economic benefits. Two recent examples from Neptune Pass, in Louisiana, and Sage Creek, in Wyoming, illustrate how following nature’s lead can spark transformative, lasting change.

As the Mississippi River flows through Louisiana and towards the Gulf of Mexico, the mud, clay, sand and silt the water carries with it is deposited into coastal wetlands. This process helps balance coastal erosion by creating new land along the shore. But increasingly frequent, climate change-driven mega-storms, along with human-made infrastructure that disrupts the river’s natural flow, have diminished its ability to build new land. As a result, a football field’s worth of the Louisiana coast now disappears into the sea every 100 minutes.

Over the last century Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land. That is roughly the same size as the state of Delaware. The remaining land weakened by erosion is more vulnerable to damage from hurricanes and storm surges.

But at Neptune Pass, a small outlet forged by the Mississippi River 70 miles south of New Orleans, nature is showing us a path to bring back eroded coastal areas and create more resilient landscapes.

After several high-water years culminating in 2019, the Mississippi River broke free of the constraints channeling it at Neptune Pass. The water flowing through Neptune Pass is now delivering enough sediment to create sandbars in Breton Sound – helping to restore the shoreline.

Replenished coastal wetlands slow storm surge and absorb floodwaters, protecting both people and property from catastrophic damage. As sediment is deposited, vegetation takes root, which also creates habitat for fish, migrating birds and other wildlife.

What began as a small outlet at Neptune Pass has now grown to become an 850-foot-wide channel. If it were categorized as a stand-alone river, it would be the 10th largest river by volume of flowing water in North America.

In past years the Army Corps of Engineers may have responded to nature breaking free in this way by closing the pass entirely as the simplest way to protect the larger river from disruption. Instead, working in consultation with environmental groups, the Corps has recommended stabilizing the pass to keep it from expanding further, while still allowing water and sediment to flow through.

By choosing to follow nature’s lead, rather than trying to force it to fit a predetermined, human-engineered project, we have built a more sustainable, long-term strategy to protect Louisiana’s Gulf Coast.

More than 1,500 miles away in an entirely different landscape, nature is creating lasting change in the Colorado River Basin. In this case, conservationists are using human-made infrastructure to kickstart a solution that will allow nature to take over and protect local communities and wildlife habitats.

Part of the Green River system, Sage Creek in Southwest Wyoming is a critical water source for local communities and native fish. The river’s importance stretches far beyond the local region. It feeds into the Green River and ultimately into Flaming Gorge reservoir, which supplies water to Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Colorado.

Over the years, conditions along Sage Creek have deteriorated due to fire, flooding, prolonged drought and other land use issues. In an effort to improve the health of the river, Trout Unlimited is working with local landowners to find ways to restore the natural environment around Sage Creek.

Their work has included building dozens of beaver starter homes, also called Beaver Dam Analogs. Designed to mimic the dams that beavers naturally build in their habitat, these structures are porous walls of sticks, logs and leaves that slow water in one part of the stream, encouraging vegetation growth and creating wetlands. This slower-flowing water naturally filters sediment and pollutants as it runs downstream, leading to cleaner water supplies and healthier landscapes.

The wetter areas established by the dams also help protect against damage from catastrophic wildfires by generating natural firebreaks and absorbing floodwaters before they reach local communities.

Beaver dam analogs are, by nature, temporary. They’re meant to serve a purpose for a time and provide an opportunity for nature to take over and continue the natural process that has been started. If there are beaver colonies close by, the hope is that they treat the analog structures as starter homes by moving in, improving the original dams and building more structures in the area. The more dams that are built, the more their habitat improves by enabling conditions for the willow and cottonwood trees beavers depend on to survive.

By focusing on nature-based strategies, we can create safer, healthier and more resilient landscapes that will benefit us today and for generations to come.

The work on Sage Creek has delivered results. Beaver colonies have moved in and, as a result, the stream bed has risen several feet in some areas. This has improved wildlife habitat and helps ensure reliable, clean and safe water supplies for communities. It also benefits farmers and ranchers by increasing vegetation for grazing and improving the reliability of irrigation supplies.

The work being done at both Neptune Pass in Louisiana and Sage Creek shows the impact we can have when we find ways to partner with nature rather than relying solely on human-designed projects to control it. By focusing on nature-based strategies, we can create safer, healthier and more resilient landscapes that will benefit us today and for generations to come.",https://dredgewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/10-7.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:00:28.010668

He urged attendees to continue collaborating and navigating challenges to find solutions to carbon capture and storage issues and bring their expertise before policymakers.

“Push boundaries together there in the Permian Basin,” he said.

Chuck McConnell, executive director at the University of Houston Center for Carbon Management in Energy, sees this as a pivotal moment for carbon capture and its use in enhancing oil recovery.

“The interest in EOR has never been stronger than it is today. This conference bears that out — it’s an exciting time. There will be business opportunities in West Texas and other parts of the world,” he said.

Utilizing captured CO2 to improve oil production has a business purpose as well as an environmental purpose. “Without both, you don’t have a winning proposition,” he said.

That carbon dioxide should be utilized, not buried or stored, and using it to increase oil production is the most obvious, productive solution, McConnell said.

For those concerned about the environmental footprint, he pointed out that “oil produced from CCUS-EOR is the lowest carbon intensity oil produced in the world. It will be better oil than anywhere else from an environmental standpoint. EOR will advance American security and affordability.”

For the Permian Basin, he said CCUS-EOR will help the long-term viability of the region, allowing recovery of oil that would otherwise be stranded. It will also help producers as they explore new benches, deeper benches and areas along the edges of the core.

“People are recognizing fossil fuels — oil and natural gas — are part of the future. We’re not denying it, we’re embracing it,” McConnell said. “We are not in an energy transition, we are in an energy transformation.”",,N,,2025-12-15 08:59:32.324339

By using renewable energy sources or natural gas, SECCO provides its clients with tailor-made solutions that reduce the cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh), prevent interruptions in production processes, and support a more sustainable energy management approach.

With more than nine decades of experience in the market, SECCO is a benchmark company in power supply and generation solutions. From its 45,000-square-meter industrial facility in Rosario, dedicated to manufacturing operations, the company designs and produces medium- and high-power units for both public and private sector clients. SECCO has installed more than 1,500 MW across over 160 power generation plants, operating either in isolated systems or connected to Argentina’s national interconnected grid (Sistema Argentino de Interconexión – SADI).

Its expertise spans multiple technologies and fuels, including renewable energy (solar PV and hybrid systems), developments aimed at optimising the use of natural resources, natural gas, and hydrocarbons.

On-site power generation: customised projects

On-site power generation refers to the production of electricity by an end user for its own consumption, using equipment installed at the same location where the energy is used. This practice reduces dependence on the public power grid, lowers energy costs, and increases supply efficiency, making it especially attractive for industrial and commercial sectors.

SECCO’s on-site power generation proposal is based on modular generation units fueled by natural gas or non-conventional gases, offering high efficiency and reliability. Each project is designed according to the specific needs of the client and includes equipment supply, assembly, installation, operational maintenance, and the option for direct operation by SECCO or training of the client’s internal staff.

Four key benefits of on-site power generation:

Lower electricity bills: A significant reduction in the cost per kWh compared to grid tariffs, with a direct impact on profitability. This optimisation of energy spending has a positive effect on overall operating costs.

Operational reliability: On-site generation systems provide stability and security to production processes by avoiding the risks associated with outages or voltage fluctuations in the public grid. This ensures continuity of critical operations and minimises losses caused by unplanned shutdowns.

Flexibility and scalability: Projects are sized according to each client’s demand, with the possibility of modular expansion. This feature allows companies to support industrial growth without the need to redesign their entire energy infrastructure from scratch.

Energy independence: Reduced reliance on the conventional power grid improves operational resilience and provides greater control over energy management. This is particularly relevant in areas with supply constraints or limitations on contracted capacity.

All power plants are monitored 24/7 via satellite from SECCO’s Generation Operations Center (COG). Clients have real-time access to telemetry data and receive email alerts in the event of any incident. In addition, the company maintains its own inventory of spare parts and original components to ensure immediate response.

In recent years, SECCO has implemented this system across the country for a wide range of sectors, including agriculture, agribusiness, food processing, industrial manufacturing, and services, among others.

For each client, a tailor-made solution has been developed: options range from grid-parallel power plants of up to 10 MW operating on natural gas—using generation units provided by SECCO—to fully islanded systems operating independently from the national power grid. Solutions for biogas power plants operating in parallel with the grid have also been designed.

Energy for a more sustainable future

With innovative solutions, proven experience, and projects operating nationwide, SECCO reaffirms its commitment to on-site power generation as a model that enhances competitiveness, profitability, and sustainability for its clients.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Secco-img2.png,N,,2025-12-15 12:03:46.534267

“It’s not going to solve every single challenge on the grid, but it’s going to provide some relief.” What can you do about electricity costs?","(NerdWallet) – Electricity prices have been on a roller coaster in the last few years, and at the moment they’re climbing — just in time for the start of winter.

Nationally, residential electricity prices rose 10.5% between January and August of this year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). That’s more than three times the annual rate of overall inflation.

But the national average hides a lot of regional variation. While three states actually saw electricity prices drop in that nine-month period, nine states saw an increase of more than 20% — topped by Missouri at 37.4% and North Dakota at 30.3%. Another 19 states saw increases between 10% and 20%.

The chance that prices are going to level out soon is slim, even as energy affordability becomes a hot-button political issue.

U.S. electricity providers are for-profit companies that are tightly regulated by state public utility commissions. In the first nine months of this year, utilities proposed and received authorization for $34 billion in rate increases — more than double the $16 billion during the same period last year, according to Powerlines, a nonprofit that focuses on regulatory and other issues affecting the U.S. power grid.

What’s causing the rise in electricity prices?

In an interview with NerdWallet, Charles Hua, founder and executive director of Powerlines, listed some of the primary causes of electricity inflation.

1. An aging power grid

“Our poles and wires are aging. It costs a lot of money to just replace that infrastructure,” Hua says. “And some of that is just because the poles and wires in your backyard are just reaching the end of their useful life.”

At the same time, energy demand is rising thanks to the AI boom and other factors. Hua notes that there are proven ways to make our current energy grid more efficient without going on a building spree — but that’s not how utilities are incentivized.

“The thing to know about utilities is that they earn a profit only on capital expenditures and not on operational expenditures,” Hua says. “So they have a structural incentive to build a bunch of new power plants and to build a bunch of new infrastructure.”

2. More extreme weather events

“The second big factor is extreme weather events — storms, wildfires, winter cold stretches, hurricanes — that have battered our energy and grid infrastructure in many ways,” Hua says.

And it’s not just a like-for-like replacement of damaged infrastructure, he adds, but upgrading it to make it more resilient as such events grow more common. Extreme weather events have also driven up insurance and other costs for utility companies.

3. Rising fuel costs

Natural gas is the biggest single source of electricity in the U.S., accounting for about 43% of power generated in 2023. Gas prices skyrocketed after Russia invaded Ukraine, and while they fell back after that spike, they have been rising again in recent months. Hua notes that in many states, utilities can pass those increases directly onto consumers.

What does it mean for consumers?

Electricity costs are a relatively small portion of average household income — around 2% — although that percentage has been growing since 2019.

What that means in dollar terms: From 2021 to 2025, the average monthly residential electric bill rose from $121 to an estimated $156, according to the NEADA. That’s enough to throw households that are already struggling financially into further turmoil.

The Washington Post did an analysis of 2025 power disconnections in 11 states, and found a year-over-year increase in eight of them. In Pennsylvania alone, power shutoffs have risen 21% this year, with 270,000 homes losing power.

Even for consumers who can absorb the increases, sticker shock on monthly power bills is turning energy affordability into a political issue — much the way egg prices were in the 2024 presidential election.

For example, both candidates in November’s gubernatorial election in New Jersey made energy affordability a central issue in their campaigns, with Democrat Mikie Sherrill declaring “a state of emergency on energy costs” in her winning campaign.

Hua thinks that issue will grow in visibility as winter sets in, especially as an increasing percentage of Americans heat their homes with electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

“I do think that in the next three months this will be just a big issue, because it’s not only substantively a big issue, but now politically it’s an issue, and so the marriage of the two will create a really unpredictable storm around utility bill costs and affordability,” Hua says.

Getting more out of the grid we have

Hua declares himself “optimistic” that increased attention on energy affordability will help push regulators to get more out of the infrastructure that’s already in place.

The grid we have is only about 40% to 50% efficient, Hua says. There are available “grid-enhancing” technologies, including increased battery storage — that Hua describes collectively as “ibuprofen for the grid” — that would boost that to 60% to 70% at a much lower cost than building equivalent new capacity.

Such measures would “make the grid more efficient and can lower prices and provide some immediate relief to the system,” Hua says. “It’s not going to solve every single challenge on the grid, but it’s going to provide some relief.”

What can you do about electricity costs?

Utilities are monopolies, so while it’s not possible to shop around for electricity providers, homeowners can take measures to make their own homes more energy-efficient.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/12/electricity-prices-e1765569105716.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-15 08:59:47.753487

We appreciate the leadership of Microsoft in the engineered carbon removal market and their collaboration to finalize this agreement.
According to carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) platform CDR.fyi, the deal further extends Microsoft’s lead as the largest global CDR purchaser by far, at 34.5 million tons, well ahead of the Frontier buyers group in second place at 1.8 million tons.
Phillip Goodman, Director of Carbon Removal Portfolio at Microsoft, said: “The BLRE project provides a unique opportunity for large-scale carbon removal, while driving broader decarbonization initiatives through green methanol production.","Renewable fuels producer C2X announced that it has signed a long-term agreement with Microsoft, with the tech giant committing to purchase 3.6 million tons of carbon removal units (CRUs) from a new low-carbon fuel project in Louisiana.

Founded in 2022, C2X develops and operates low carbon molecule production facilities in strategic locations to supply low carbon fuels and feedstocks to the shipping, chemical, aviation and industrial sectors. The company is majority controlled by the A.P. Moller Group with Japan’s largest integrated energy company ENEOS as a minority shareholder.

The CRUs for the new contract will be generated by C2X subsidiary Beaver Lake Renewable Energy’s planned $2.5 billion bio-methanol plant near Pineville, Louisiana. Located on the site of a former paper mill, the new project is designed to convert locally and sustainably sourced forestry residues into bio-methanol and biogenic CO2 that will be subsequently captured.

At full scale, the new bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) project will have the capacity to produce more than 500,000 metric tons of bio-methanol per year, and will capture and store approximately 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually.

Under the new agreement, Beaver Lake will deliver CRUs to Microsoft representing CO2 that has been removed and permanently stored in secure geologic formations in Louisiana, with all associated lifecycle emissions – including biomass sourcing, facility operations, and downstream transportation – accounted for and subtracted to ensure net carbon removal, and with the project’s CRUs to be registered and issued on an ICROA-endorsed registry, which includes verification by an independent third-party. C2X added that the project will follow sustainable biomass sourcing projects, including aligning with the principles outlined in EU RED III.

Construction on the project is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2026, with operations expected to start during 2029.

Brian Davis, CEO of C2X, said:

“The Beaver Lake project combines the benefits of bio-methanol production for customers in hard-to-abate sectors with permanent carbon removals. We appreciate the leadership of Microsoft in the engineered carbon removal market and their collaboration to finalize this agreement. We look forward to working with other companies seeking to access biogenic carbon for sequestration as we deliver this project and scale up our portfolio globally.”

The agreement marks the latest in a series of large-scale carbon removal purchases by Microsoft, forming part of the tech giant’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, including several BECCS-focused deals by the company this year. According to carbon dioxide removals (CDRs) platform CDR.fyi, the deal further extends Microsoft’s lead as the largest global CDR purchaser by far, at 34.5 million tons, well ahead of the Frontier buyers group in second place at 1.8 million tons.

Phillip Goodman, Director of Carbon Removal Portfolio at Microsoft, said:

“The BLRE project provides a unique opportunity for large-scale carbon removal, while driving broader decarbonization initiatives through green methanol production. We value the technical and commercial expertise of the C2X team, which has demonstrated commitment to sustainable biomass sourcing, rigorous carbon accounting, and thoughtful engagement of the project’s surrounding community.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Microsoft1.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:00:32.529470

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C.
The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.
Two nuclear reactors built in a similar way in Georgia went $17 billion over budget before they were fully operational in 2023.","COLUMBIA, S.C. — South Carolina’s stalled nuclear power project could finally finish construction as a private company has offered to pay $2.7 billion to the state-owned utility and a small share of the power if they can reach an agreement to get the two reactors up and running.

The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.

The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.

Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper’s costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.

Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.

The unfinished, weathered concrete and metal tower of at least one plant sits not far from the working reactor that has been running 1984 at the rural site about 20 miles (32 kilometers) up the Broad River from Columbia.

Four executives ended up in prison or home confinement for lying to regulators, shareholders, ratepayers and investigators and left millions of people paying for decades for a project that never produced electricity. Taxpayers and ratepayers ended up on the hook because of a state law that allowed the utilities to charge for costs before any power was generated.

If the $2.7 billion payment goes through, most of Santee Cooper’s debt from the nuclear debacle would be erased, utility CEO Jimmy Staton said at a recent board meeting where the proposal was unanimously approved.

“Our customers have been paying for these assets since 2017. It’s time they get some value out of that,” Staton said.

Interest in the project has grown as power demand in the U.S. surges with the increase in data centers as artificial intelligence technology develops.

President Donald Trump’s administration wants the U.S. to quadruple the amount of power generated by nuclear plants over the next 25 years.

But watchdog groups said there are too many hurdles to put this project in the win column right now.

After eight years in the elements, all the equipment and the structure of the plant, which was less than halfway finished, will need to be carefully inspected before it can be used. The permits to build and the licenses to operate the nuclear plants will need to be renewed, likely starting from scratch, said Tom Clements, executive director of the nuclear watchdog group Savannah River Site Watch.

The initiative includes new EV vehicles to the Town’s fleet and multiple charging stations throughout the town for community use.

“Giving environmentally sound options to drivers throughout Huntington is critically important for the entire Town and the communities we serve”, said Supervisor Ed Smyth. “We are already experiencing significant benefits to the town by introducing EV’s to our fleet and providing strategically located charging stations for Town vehicles and the community at large. Overall, this project will be a win for the Town, win for the community and a win for the environment”.

Over the past several months, the Town has been rolling out EV Stations, and the new electric vehicles that have been added to the Town fleet. Town departments utilizing new EV vehicles include those that require frequent travel throughout the day, including: Public Safety, General Services, Information Technology, and Parks and Recreation. To date, the new fleet vehicles include three Ford F150 Lighting Trucks and four Chevrolet Equinox. Fleet charging stations have also been installed at Town Hall, and the Town’s General Services Facility located at Boxer Court in Huntington to facilitate the new EV fleet. The Raymond T. Cavanagh Maintenance Facility on Pulaski Road will also have charging stations for both Town fleet and the general public.

This new environmentally dynamic and progressive project, while promoting clean, green energy, will also ease the range anxiety of EV vehicle drivers, provide charging convenience for apartment dwellers, shoppers and Parks and open space users.

The Town of Huntington was able to fast-track this EV initiative through a series of grants and rebates from multiple sources. This EV funding enabled the town to add to its existing fleet with EV trucks and SUV’s, charging stations for both municipal fleet and the general public.

Participating grant, funding, and rebate awards were as follows:

NYSERDA $250,000 – Clean Energy Community Grant

EECBG $233,500 – Energy Efficiency & Conservation Block Grant

PSEG Long Island $137,750 – Make Ready Rebates

SAM $27,500 – State and Municipal (SAM) Facilities Grants

EOSPA $62,000 – Environmental Open Space and Parks (EOSPA) Fund

A total of $668,500 in grants, funding and rebates were used to offset this project. An additional $63,000 from EOSPA made the total funding $730,500.

One significant partner in the Town’s EV program has been PSEG Long Island. By utilizing their EV Make Ready program, the Town can benefit from electric infrastructure incentives that can cover up to $65,000 per port for DC Fast Chargers and up to $6,500 per port for Level 2 Chargers. PSEG Long Island’s initiative aims to make EV charging more accessible and encourage the transition to cleaner transportation.

“Kudos to the Town of Huntington for installing public EV charging stations around the town and also replacing some of its gas-powered fleet vehicles with money and energy-saving electric vehicles,” said Paul DiBenedetto, PSEG Long Island’s Electric Vehicle Program manager. “The chargers will help to reduce range anxiety and encourage drivers to choose EVs. We encourage other municipalities to follow Huntington’s lead as a good steward of the environment utilizing PSEG Long Island’s EV Make Ready Program to offset costs to save taxpayers money.”

The new EV charging stations are located at the Town’s General Service Facilities at Boxer Court (6 Ports) and Pulaski Road, Pulaski Road (4 ports); Town Hall (4 ports), Veterans Park (4 ports), and Otsego Park (4 ports). These charging stations are added to the ports already installed at the Huntington LIRR Train Station and Town Hall.

Additional benefits to the town’s EV initiative include:

Spend less on fuel and maintenance costs for your vehicle fleet

Enhance the town’s sustainability efforts and support the Town’s campaign to become a Climate Smart Silver Community.

Fiscal benefits including rebates and federal tax credits for purchasing or leasing an EVs

Increase employee and customer satisfaction by offering EV charging options

Reduce the Town’s carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner and healthier community.

EV Vehicle ownership is growing in the State of New York with 320,362 registered EV vehicles as of November 2025 according to NYSERDA. Suffolk County has 41,154 registered EV’s. Of the 41,154 EV’s in Suffolk, the Town of Huntington has 8.657 or 21% of those vehicles. Almost ¼ of all EV’s in the County are in the Town of Huntington.

Supervisor Ed Smyth and the Town Board is making a commitment EV use in the Town. The Town has already approved future EV projects that are supported by grant funding, and include:

2022 Zero-emission Vehicle (ZEV) Infrastructure Grant Program $123,264

Huntington Station LIRR Parking Lot (non-commuter) (8 ports)

Dix Hills Ice Rink (4 ports)

An incentive for home solar The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.
Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush.
Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.","On their small farm in Wahoo, Nebraska, Rhonda McClure and her husband toss a few pumpkins over the fence to a flock of ewes. They sell market lambs and wool, some of which Rhonda uses as a fiber artist, along with garden produce and compost.

She said they’ve always tried to use sustainable practices on their farm, including rotational grazing, geothermal energy and most recently — solar.

“The solar just fits in with trying to be as independent and careful of the environment as we can,” McClure said.

For the McClures, harnessing energy from the sun allows them to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and keep their energy costs down over the long run.

A solar array they added in 2021 to help power their well and home reduced their summer energy bills from several hundred dollars per month to as low as $4, McClure said.

They added a solar battery this spring to release energy at night and act as a back-up during regional power outages.

“It’s provided a good deal of security for us to know that if we’re off grid for a while, if something happens, we can get by,” McClure said. “We have water and heat and the essential services here, for us and our livestock.”

Now they’re wrapping up another solar project, largely to provide air conditioning for a new outbuilding used to store and process wool, teach classes and host large groups of people.

McClure said they likely would have waited to install it next spring. But they bumped up the timeline when they found out the Residential Clean Energy Credit was rapidly expiring. Congress voted this summer to eliminate it at the end of 2025 through the One Big Beautiful Bill.

An incentive for home solar

The federal tax credit covers 30% of overall project costs for home solar, along with wind, geothermal, fuel cells and battery storage.

Some version of a residential solar tax credit has been around for decades with short-term extensions becoming the norm since President George W. Bush. But the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden kicked the deadline to 2032 for the full credit, followed by a rate phase down.

The Biden administration said the tax credit and two dozen others in the Inflation Reduction Act would “save families money on their energy bills and accelerate the deployment of clean energy, clean vehicles, clean buildings, and clean manufacturing.”

Over 752,000 households claimed the Residential Clean Energy Credit on their 2023 taxes. Incentive-driven consumer demand and market stability also supported growth in domestic solar manufacturing, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit made solar more affordable for homeowners by lowering the upfront costs and shortening the amount of time before they recoup their initial investment, said Paul Cutting.

Cutting helps homeowners identify opportunities to improve their energy efficiency and pay for them as an energy auditor with Clean Energy Districts of Iowa. The affiliation includes 15 county-level organizations across eastern Iowa and one in Wisconsin.

The cost of installing solar depends largely on the size of the home, along with its location and overall electricity usage, Cutting said. The national average is $23,500, according to the nonprofit Center for Sustainable Energy, but some industry experts say some residential solar projects can exceed $40,000.

“The solar tax credit being funded at the full 30% makes it pretty enticing for a homeowner to move forward with that,” Cutting said.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill cut the tax credit deadline off at the end of the year instead of its original phase out starting in 2032. Homeowners working with contractors must have their systems installed and invoices paid by Dec. 31 to qualify.

A rush on solar

Cutting said solar installation companies in his region quickly booked up after President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in July.

That was the experience of StraightUp Solar, a company that designs and installs solar systems for homes, businesses, nonprofits and government agencies in Missouri and Illinois.

“We sold out in September, and many other solar companies were selling out in July, which means their entire build schedule was full for 2025 because people wanted to get in before the tax credit expired at the end of the year,” said Eric Schneider, director of business development for StraightUp Solar.

The company’s third quarter of 2025 was the second busiest for inquiries, said Schneider. The biggest spike was in 2022 when homeowners expected an earlier tax credit to sunset before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.

“We call it the ‘solar coaster’ in the industry because demand fluctuates up and down,” Schneider said. “Some of it's policy driven; some of it's interest rate driven.”

Despite the loss of the Residential Clean Energy Credit, Schneider remains optimistic about the coming year and the future of the industry at large.

The price of solar power has fallen dramatically in the last 15 years as panels have become more efficient, increasing its appeal to homeowners concerned about rising energy bills, Schneider said.

Cutting agreed.

“I imagine there's going to be a slowdown [in 2026], but I think solar at this point probably has a lot to stand on its own.” Cutting said.

Higher electricity rates

Inflation, higher demand, natural disasters and upgrades to aging infrastructure have driven up electricity rates across the U.S. in the last five years.

And they’re expected to continue their upward trajectory, in large part due to the acceleration of artificial intelligence. Projected growth in data centers and cryptocurrency mining could increase average electricity generation costs in the U.S. 8% by 2030, with some regions seeing increases as high as 25%, according to the Open Energy Outlook Initiative.

More utilities are also shifting to “time-of-use” or “time-of-day” pricing, which sets higher electricity rates during peak hours, typically late afternoon and evening on weekdays.

A homeowner with solar panels and a battery back-up can draw from their stored energy – rather than the grid – during peak hours to save money, Schneider said.

These customers are also insulated from future energy rate hikes, said Corey Ziemann, solar program coordinator for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association.

“If you're buying solar, you're essentially buying all the energy you're going to use from that system all at once. You're locking in that rate so you won't be subject to the increases that are coming,” Ziemann said.

The loss of the federal tax credit will likely stretch out the payback period for homeowners, Ziemann said. But another way to help make home solar more affordable is through “group buy” programs, which bring individuals from a community together to purchase in bulk.

The Midwest Renewable Energy Association’s Grow Solar team has facilitated more than 70 group buy programs in Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota and Missouri. An advisory committee made up of local stakeholders and officials review bids and vote on an installer to use.

Ziemann added that it’s cheaper for an installer to have crews working in a concentrated area.

“Typically, our group buys will be about 15%-18% below market rate, and then there can be additional discounts after that,” he said.

The association helped coordinate a group buy in eastern Iowa this fall, Ziemann said, which allowed over 30 homes and businesses in Jasper and Poweshiek counties to install solar.

Schneider with StraightUp Solar also sees potential with “Power Purchase Agreements” and lease programs, which he said his company and others have started to offer. Similar to leasing a car, Schneider said the homeowner uses the solar panels without owning them.

“You're getting all the benefits from the utility. You're getting the net metering; you're getting the low utility bill because you're getting solar energy directly to your house,” Schneider said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill allows companies that own the solar panels to take advantage of the commercial solar tax credit, which doesn’t expire until Dec. 31, 2027.

One of the downsides to leasing and power purchase agreements for homeowners are lower long-term savings compared to someone who owns their solar system and uses it for 20-30 years, Schneider said.

State carrots

Schneider and Ziemann said more state-level incentives could help accelerate the growth of residential solar.

They pointed to the Illinois Shines program as an example. Before adding solar, homeowners work with state-approved installation companies and other third parties to estimate how much electricity their panels will produce over 15 years. Each megawatt-hour of solar electricity is worth one “renewable energy credit.”

Electric utilities in Illinois buy renewable energy credits from the installation companies to comply with the state’s target of hitting 100% clean energy by 2050. In exchange, homeowners benefit from “reduced purchase prices, installation costs, lease payments, or other methods agreed upon in a contract,” according to a document from the Illinois Shines program.

Certasun, one of the approved vendors, said the Illinois Shines program can cut costs for homeowners up to 40%.

“We're looking at operating more programs in Illinois right now because they have great solar incentives,” Ziemann said.

He’s hopeful more state legislatures will consider adopting the model used in Illinois.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d83aca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1700x893+0+191/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2c%2Fa4%2F544c81534739b8e8e2ab6e031605%2F20251123-mcclures-solar.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:59:41.513374

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/12/the-republican-congress-pushes-back-slowly-on-trump/,"President Donald Trump has said he will sign the bill, an annual piece of legislation that sets Pentagon policy.
But the most consistent Republican pushback against Trump, including in ways that will likely stick, has come from within the halls of Congress.
Those changes are contained in the broader military bill expected to clear the Senate this week, following a House vote of 312-112.
“This Congress must stand up against another war in Venezuela,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California.
“The American people do not want another regime-change war.” Decrying “endless wars,” Khanna demanded Hegseth appear before Congress to testify.","Conaway, a Democrat who represents New Jersey’s Third Congressional District, and Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st) folded language into a broader bill to force the Pentagon to turn over information about how the Trump administration could use military bases, such as Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, to hold and then deport immigrants.

“There was a bipartisan agreement that this is not an appropriate use for these military bases. They’re designed to project force overseas, to defend the homeland and to make sure that we are ready,” Conaway said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News. “To the extent that those operations are interfered with, we think it’s a mistake.”

The Senate is expected to pass the broader bill, with the immigration language included, this week. President Donald Trump has said he will sign the bill, an annual piece of legislation that sets Pentagon policy.

The tacked-on language fits a pattern playing out in Washington, where Republicans control both halves of Congress and the White House, of tepid but notable pushback from Capitol Hill against the president, in particular on topics of foreign affairs and military policy.

This trend arrived as Trump’s overall job approval has slipped, hitting 36% approval, according to a poll by AP-NORC published last week. On foreign policy specifically, Trump’s approval rating is 37%, the survey, conducted in early December of 1,146 adults nationwide, said.

The House voted Thursday to nullify a Trump executive order to end union rights at federal agencies, drawing support from 20 Republicans — including Reps. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), Chris Smith (R-4th) and Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th). Though the Republican-majority Senate won’t pick up that bill, a Trump-backed effort by Republicans in Indiana to redraw congressional maps to their political advantage also crumbled Thursday. “I wasn’t working on it very hard,” Trump told reporters of the Indiana setback.

But the most consistent Republican pushback against Trump, including in ways that will likely stick, has come from within the halls of Congress.

As the Trump administration ratchets up military tensions with Venezuela — the president confirmed in October that he had authorized covert CIA action in the South American country — Congress is about to scrap two legal authorizations the president could use to commence military operations.

Those changes are contained in the broader military bill expected to clear the Senate this week, following a House vote of 312-112. One of those authorizations is from 1991. The other is from 2002.

Rep. Brian Mast, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, highlighted that change during floor debate on the legislation, saying “very importantly, we are scrapping the old 1991 and 2002 Iraq war authorizations.”

The bill contains several other items meant to extract information from the Pentagon.

It withholds 25% of the travel budget for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth until he shares his orders approving dozens of missile strikes on boats in the Caribbean, acts critics of the Trump administration have denounced as extrajudicial killings.

It also would force the Pentagon to release video of one of those strikes, a Sept. 2 attack that killed 11 people and has drawn particular scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans on Capitol Hill.

The armed services committees of the House and Senate, which Republicans hold in their majority, are each investigating the Trump administration’s missile strikes on the shipping vessels.

“[The bill] reasserts some of the authority of the congressional branch, and whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, I think you ought to be happy about that,” said Washington congressman Adam Smith, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.

Looking to Europe, members of the armed services committees included sections to strengthen U.S. security aid to Ukraine and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the three Baltic nations that border Russia. They also included language to prevent the Trump administration, with its isolationist bent, from removing troops from Eastern Europe and require the Department of Defense to consult Congress before it may pull troops from Europe or South Korea.

Lawmakers within both parties, especially on the wings, applauded the end of the military authorizations, though some said Congress must move swiftly to rein in the administration’s aggression against Venezuela.

“This Congress must stand up against another war in Venezuela,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California. “The American people do not want another regime-change war.”

Decrying “endless wars,” Khanna demanded Hegseth appear before Congress to testify.

Hegseth has defended the vessel strikes as part of an effort to protect the U.S. from drug traffickers.

“Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” he added in a recent online post. In another instance, he wrote, “We have only just begun to kill narco-terrorists.”

On Dec. 3, a bipartisan group of senators filed legislation to block the U.S. military from attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Congress is scheduled to recess this week before returning in January, heading home for a holiday break, leaving little time before the new year for a vote on that measure.

Previous votes this year to deny Trump war powers have failed in the Senate.

It has been difficult for committees that oversee the U.S. military to receive records they have sought.

“That has been an issue,” Conaway said in the interview. “They call themselves the most transparent administration ever. They use superlatives all the time, and very often the exact opposite is happening.”

He chuckled, dryly. “So, we’ll see. Maybe there will be some epiphany that will occur.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/12/AP25336639159297-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:59:23.927613

The Tar Heel State ranks fifth for total installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, which values the state’s solar market at $14.4 billion.
Pine Gate Renewables, a utility-scale solar and energy storage developer based in Asheville, closed its plant and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November.
Through this, North Carolina would receive $156 million towards projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.
Despite the loss of federal funding, he says, there’s still a growing demand for distributed solar energy resources.","Over the past few years, North Carolina has become one of the nation’s leading states for solar energy development and investment. Solar industry advocates are fighting to keep it that way despite cuts to renewable energy initiatives at the federal level.

At the end of 2025, the state’s solar sector finds itself facing headwinds from federal policy changes and tariffs, but seeing new growth opportunities in advances in storage technology and rising demand for distributed power sources, especially in rural areas.

The Tar Heel State ranks fifth for total installed solar capacity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, which values the state’s solar market at $14.4 billion.

Solar installations are split into three categories: residential, commercial, and utility, which refers to larger-scale projects.

Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, says much of the state’s solar capacity to date is deployed in utility-scale projects. “But over the past couple of years,” Abele added, “we’ve seen really, really strong growth in the residential solar sector.”

There were about 7,500 solar jobs in North Carolina as of the third quarter in 2025, SEIA found, putting the state at 11th in the country. These workers are employed by 253 solar companies, producing and installing enough solar technology to power about 1.1 million homes across the state.

The sector has grown since 2024, when there were about 7,356 solar jobs at 224 solar companies in the state, according to SEIA.

Over the past year, however, President Donald Trump has sought to undo initiatives related to renewable energy and the environment.

“President Trump is committed to unleashing American energy and preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable energy policies from the Green New Scam,” the White House said in July.

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” signed by Trump in July eliminated a 30% residential solar tax credit for systems installed after 2025, dramatically shortening the timeline provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which would have provided the 30% tax credit through 2032.

The sudden change has led to a very busy autumn for the residential side of the industry, but an uncertain future in 2026.

Abele said most solar installers across the state were fully booked up by early September because there was so much demand from new customers wanting to collect the tax credit. He said installing a residential system usually takes between eight to 12 weeks, due to procedural steps like utility interconnection and permitting.

“You’re seeing a mad dash right now to get projects moving,” Abele said, “trying to expedite the deployment of projects that are already in the pipeline and making sure those projects are completed prior to those tax credits expiring.”

At the utility-scale level, tax credits for larger projects remain available through 2027.

Chris Carmody, executive director at Carolinas Clean Energy Business Association, said he tends to describe the industry as “solar plus storage,” because for larger projects, systems using solar are built with storage.

This means utilities are able to deposit the energy and dispatch it when needed — such as at night, during cloudy conditions, or when gas prices are particularly high.

“The arrival of major storage investment is something that has kept solar pretty healthy in North Carolina, despite tough trends from Washington, DC,” Carmody said.

Tax changes aren’t the only challenge facing the solar market. Tariffs on foreign goods imposed by the Trump administration have also led to higher costs for potential solar consumers.

Along with imposing tariffs on different countries that make solar panels — including China, which dominates the global market — the Trump administration also implemented a 50% tariff on imported steel.

“That affects every kind of energy, so solar, gas plants, and gas pipelines,” Carmody said. “It makes anything that requires steel as a building material much, much more expensive.”

North Carolina is already seeing the effects of these changes.

Pine Gate Renewables, a utility-scale solar and energy storage developer based in Asheville, closed its plant and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November. The company laid off more than 78% of its workforce, impacting 223 people in Buncombe County, WLOS reported.

Carmody said many other companies are cutting back their workforce in general due to uncertainty about future federal policy.

“In addition to being really sad for these employees, it’s an indicator that makes people nervous about investing in this environment,” Carmody said.

In August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency abruptly ended the Solar for All program, a Biden-era initiative awarding $7 billion in grants nationally. Through this, North Carolina would receive $156 million towards projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.

Projects using the program’s funding were set to start in fall 2025.

Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined representatives of 22 other states and the District of Columbia in an October lawsuit against the EPA. The plaintiffs claim the cancellation of the Solar for All program was illegal.

Steve Kalland, executive director of the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center, had been working on developing a contractor registration list for the program.

“We saw this as a potentially really valuable program, and we remain hopeful that things will proceed to a point where it’s allowed to move forward again,” Kalland said. “We’re doing our best to find other ways to help the citizens of North Carolina that are interested in utilizing clean energy resources.”

This includes training people who want to be involved in installation and providing support to businesses looking to use renewable technologies.

Kalland acknowledges the state’s solar industry is facing a period of change, but he remains optimistic. Despite the loss of federal funding, he says, there’s still a growing demand for distributed solar energy resources.

The center has partnered with organizations providing resources to western North Carolina in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, as well as parts of eastern North Carolina that have been affected over the years by natural disasters, leading to similar needs for energy.

“There is a lot of effort right now to try and figure out how we can keep solar as affordable as possible,” he said. “Folks still see the value in these technologies, and we’ll continue to see them move forward.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 06:57:42.223593

“The closing of the coal plant had been really brutal,” he said. “But this project just took the entire chess board and flipped it.”

The Homer City facility will generate and consume as much power as all the homes in the Philadelphia urban area. It is among a generation of new supersized data centers sprouting across the country, the footprints of which are measured in miles, not feet.

They are part of an AI moon shot, driven by an escalating U.S.-China war over dominance in the field. The projects are starting to transform landscapes and communities, sparking debates about what our energy systems and environment can sustain. The price includes increasing power costs for everyone and worrying surges in emissions and pollutants, according to government, industry and academic analyses.

By 2030, industry and government projections show data centers could gobble up more than 10 percent of the nation’s power usage.

Estimates vary, but all show a dizzying rise of between 60 and 150 percent in energy consumption by 2030. On average, they project U.S. data centers will use about 430 trillion watt-hours by 2030. That is enough electricity to power nearly 16 Chicagos.

Some forecasts project it will keep growing from there.

“These things are industrial on a scale I have never seen in my life,” former Google CEO Eric Schmidt told a House committee earlier this year.

Tech companies that once pledged to use clean energy alone are fast reconsidering. They now need too much uninterrupted power, too fast. According to the International Energy Agency, the No. 1 power source to meet this need will be natural gas.

“While we remain committed to our climate moonshots, it’s become clear that achieving them is now more complex and challenging across every level,” Google states in its 2025 environmental impact report. The company says meeting its goal of eliminating all emissions by 2030 has become “very difficult.”

Data center firms have already approached the Homer City project’s natural gas provider, EQT, seeking enough fuel to power the equivalent of eight more Homer City projects around the country, EQT CEO Toby Rice said in an interview. And EQT is just one of dozens of U.S. natural gas suppliers.

“We’ll be shipping more gas than we ever thought,” said Arshad Mansoor, president and CEO of the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute. “We are even unretiring coal.”

Mansoor predicts it will all work out: He and others in the industry foresee the crushing demand leading to swift breakthroughs in clean energy innovation and deployment. That could include futuristic fusion power, they said, or more conventional technologies that capture natural gas emissions.

But some are more skeptical. The independent monitor charged with keeping tabs on the PJM power grid — which serves 65 million customers in the eastern U.S. — is warning that it can’t handle more data centers. It urged federal regulators to indefinitely block more data centers on its grid to protect existing customers.

Even in cities yearning to become the next data center hub — with unions welcoming the burst of construction jobs and elected officials offering lucrative tax packages — some apprehension remains.

“It’s going to be new to everybody,” said Steffee, of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. “We all have to figure out how to start transitioning into this and what the ripple effects will be.”

Homer City offers a glimpse of what is coming nationwide.

In the Texas Panhandle, the company Fermi America broke ground this year on what it says will be a 5,800-acre complex of gas plants and giant nuclear reactors that would ultimately feed up to 18 million square feet of on-site data centers. It would dwarf Homer City in energy use.

Tech companies are planning data ‘campuses’ that would dwarf existing centers

In Cheyenne, Wyoming, developers are aiming to generate 10 gigawatts of electricity for on-site data centers. That’s enough energy to power every house in Wyoming 20 times over. In rural Louisiana, Meta is building a $30 billion cluster of data center buildings that will stretch nearly the length and width of Manhattan.

Glenn Youngkin vetoed more energy bills than he signed, killing legislation designed to increase rooftop solar and energy storage, strengthen utility planning requirements, and make efficiency improvements more available to low-income residents.

Now, with Abigail Spanberger set to replace Youngkin in the Governor’s Mansion and Democrats in a position of legislative strength, those bills are back.

Democrats revive clean-energy bills as Spanberger prepares to take office

Members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) met several times this fall to examine last year’s failed energy bills to determine which should get the commission’s endorsement this year. CEUR is comprised primarily of legislative leaders from the Senate and House committees that hear energy bills, so endorsements signal a strong likelihood of passage.

But while the bills CEUR endorsed show promise, I can’t help thinking they had better be just a starting point.

Energy affordability and making data centers pay their fair share are supposed to be the top objectives for legislators this year. That makes it interesting, and concerning, that even as CEUR went beyond the vetoed bills to endorse some small new initiatives, it didn’t propose any legislation that would either supercharge generation in Virginia or put the onus on the tech companies to solve their supply problem themselves.

We know bills like that are coming. Ann Bennett, the lead author of the Sierra Club’s comprehensive report on the state of the industry in Virginia, was, I hope, being hyperbolic when she told me she expects “a hundred” data center bills this session. Regardless, there will be a lot of them.

Many will be land use bills that don’t go to the energy committees, but others will tackle the central contradiction at the heart of Virginia’s data center buildout: our leaders want the industry to grow, but haven’t faced squarely the problem of where the energy will come from.

Getting more power on the grid (or freeing up capacity)

Some of the vetoed bills returning this year will put more energy on the grid. They won’t be enough to power the data center industry, but every bit helps. This includes one of the environmental communities’ top priorities, a bill that expands the role of rooftop solar in Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS).

A new bill permitting balcony solar also got CEUR’s endorsement. Balcony solar – two or three panels that plug into a wall outlet, reducing a resident’s need to buy power – is the buzziest new idea of the year. The systems are too small to make much of a difference in megawatt terms, but by democratizing access to solar they counter the reputation of solar as a technology for rich people and will make it possible for solar skeptics to see for themselves that solar does actually work and save money.

Another CEUR initiative is a bill similar to one Youngkin vetoed that creates a carveout in the state’s renewable portfolio standard specifically for geothermal heat pumps. Like balcony solar, geothermal heat pumps don’t put electricity onto the grid, but by freeing up power for other customers it has the same effect.

CEUR also endorsed a bill to simplify billing in the shared solar program in Appalachian Power Company’s territory, but a far more significant proposal to greatly expand shared solar in Dominion territory was deemed not ready for consideration after one of its patrons, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said it was still in negotiation.

The SCC recently directed a change in the calculation of Dominion Energy’s minimum bill that industry advocates say should make the program workable for customers beyond the low-income residents who were the only ones formerly able to access it. As currently drafted, the bill would allow shared solar to increase up to a maximum of 6% of Dominion’s peak load. That gives this bill the potential to make a meaningful dent in Virginia’s energy shortfall – if Dominion doesn’t block it.

That assumes developers can get the community solar projects permitted at the local level.

Virginia localities are notorious for denying permits to solar projects of all sizes, a recalcitrance that has contributed to Virginia having to import fully half of the electricity consumed in the state. CEUR has now scrapped last year’s big idea of allowing solar developers to appeal local government permit denials to the SCC, after failing to persuade enough legislators to vote for it last year. All that is left of that bill is a piece that establishes a university consortium to provide research and technical assistance.

Luckily, last year’s other major solar siting bill lives on; it codifies best practices for solar projects without removing localities’ ability to deny permits even for projects that meet the high standards. New this year, however, is a requirement that localities provide a record of their decisions to the SCC, including the reason for any adverse decision.

It’s not the solution the industry and landowners need to bring predictability to the local permitting process, but it does ratchet up pressure on county boards that have a habit of denying projects without articulating a legitimate reason. And sure enough, imposing that modest amount of accountability was enough to get Joe Lerch from the Virginia Association of Counties to speak against the proposal at the CEUR meeting.

VACO seems likely to lose the fight this time around, and it should. Blocking solar development leads directly to higher electricity prices for consumers across the state. Moreover, it denies even a minimum of due process to landowners who want to install solar on their property – including farmers who need the income just to hold onto their land. For VACO to insist on counties having carte blanche to reject projects, with no responsibility to justify their decision, is arrogant and an abuse of the local prerogative.

Making the most of what’s already there

Anyone who keeps up with energy news has learned more in the past year about how the grid works than most of us ever wanted to know. There is widespread agreement that grid operator PJM has mismanaged its job, keeping new low-cost generation from interconnecting and driving up utility bills for customers across the region. Unfortunately, there is little that Virginia can do by itself to fix PJM.

But one key bit of information we can use is that utilities and the grid operator build infrastructure to meet the highest levels of demand on the hottest afternoons and coldest nights of the year, leaving much of that infrastructure sitting idle at other times. A recent study showed the grid could absorb far more data center demand than it can now if it weren’t for the 5% of the time when demand is at its highest.

The issue is framed in terms of data centers being willing to curtail operations at times of peak demand, a solution for the companies that can do it. But there is also a broader point: we don’t need as much new generation if we use what we have better.

That’s the principle behind several bills that CEUR endorsed. The most significant of these is a bill vetoed by Youngkin last year that almost doubles the targets for short-term energy storage laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act and adds targets for long-duration energy storage. As currently drafted, the 2026 version also adds new fire safety standards.

But CEUR did not discuss another obvious approach to increasing storage capacity on the grid: requiring data centers to have storage on-site, replacing highly-polluting diesel generators for at least the first couple of hours of a power outage and using spare battery capacity to assist the grid at other times. If Virginia is going to keep adding data centers at the current rate, this simply has to be part of the plan. We need far more storage than the CEUR bill calls for, and tech companies, not ratepayers, should bear the cost.

CEUR’s utility reform proposals would also help Virginia’s grid get the most out of what we already have. A bill to improve the integrated resource planning process (again, vetoed by Youngkin) requires utilities to consider surplus interconnection service projects to maximize existing transmission capacity.

Helping low-income residents save money

CEUR endorsed several proposals that could help residents save money on energy bills. Some, like shared solar, balcony solar, geothermal heat pumps and the distributed solar expansion bill, would benefit anyone willing to make the investment.

For low-income residents, weatherization and efficiency upgrades remain the focus. Last year the governor vetoed legislation from Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax and Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, which would have required Dominion and APCo to expand their low-income weatherization assistance to reach 30% of qualifying customers. Sickles has already reintroduced his bill as HB2. CEUR endorsed a different recommendation from staff that the two utilities be required to extend their spending on energy assistance and weatherization programs.

CEUR did not examine a related bill that has been reintroduced this year following a Youngkin veto last winter, establishing an income-qualified energy efficiency and weatherization task force to produce policy recommendations to ensure repairs and retrofits reach all eligible households.

However, CEUR endorsed a bill that will require all utilities to disclose to the SCC information about electric utility disconnections, which presumably will inform the work of the task force.

We’re going to need more

Even taken together, CEUR’s initiatives don’t fully address the biggest energy crunch Virginia has ever faced, and the rising utility bills that result. Possibly that is intentional; Democrats will continue to control the governor’s seat as well as the legislature for at least two years, giving them time to ramp up programs and see what works.

But data center development is so far outstripping supply side solutions that if legislators aren’t more aggressive this year, next year they will find themselves further behind than ever.

As more bills are filed over the coming weeks, we are likely to see plenty of bold proposals. Hopefully, legislators now understand the urgency, and will be ready to act.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/img_5535-1024x7301765794291.jpg?h=167871c3&itok=EeoYQ8ob,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:44.730291

They’re just moving further and further apart on how to actually do it.

Partisan fighting and intraparty tensions over a slate of permitting reform bills are signaling that the once bipartisan policy goal may once again stall in Congress, even as lawmakers emphasize the need for more energy infrastructure and housing to tackle the growing cost-of-living crisis.

“Polarization is part of everything, so I’m sure it has a role here at some level,” Marc Boom, a former senior adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency under the Biden administration, told NOTUS. “The best solution is going to be one that leaves everyone happy, and the path that I’m seeing doesn’t seem like that.”

A group of conservative Republican lawmakers is threatening to withhold support from a bipartisan bill that would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, a key permitting statute. Why? It has a measure that would provide wins for renewable energy developers who want to insulate their projects from a Trump administration crackdown.

Progressive Democrats and environmentalists, meanwhile, are upset that the bill would weaken community input and environmental review on proposed projects.

The impending vote on the SPEED Act comes after lawmakers got into a fiery debate on the House floor last Thursday over a bill that would weaken the scope of reviews under the Clean Water Act. Republicans said that bill would speed up infrastructure, but most Democrats criticized it on environmental grounds.

“You will hear no argument from me about the need for permitting reform,” Democratic Rep. Hillary Scholten said on the floor ahead of a vote on the bill. “We do need reform, but this bill is not what we need. It doesn’t just cut red tape, it cuts all the tape that has protected our clean water for 50 years.”

The bill passed, with a handful of moderate Democrats joining most Republicans in voting “yes.” So did a different bill that would speed up permitting for natural gas pipelines.

But both came with some mudslinging.

Republican Rep. David Taylor said his “colleagues across the aisle continue to promote the fallacy of improving permit processes comes at the expense of the environment.”

Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal called the Clean Water Act legislation “Republicans’ latest attempt to help corporate polluters dodge responsibility.”

Outside the halls of Congress, permitting reform advocates are hinging hope on the bigger picture: that both parties say they want to get something done.

“There’s a real chance that we can find a path forward on a bill that really is a win-win for everybody,” Xan Fishman, the vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s energy program, told NOTUS.

“There are a few exceptions on both sides, but it seems like they all understand the need for permitting reform, and they’re working towards permitting reform, which is always a good thing when you’ve got both parties willing to compromise a little bit,” John Szoka, the CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, told NOTUS.

Among the areas of compromise: a bill to digitize the federal permitting process passed the House unanimously this week.

But that’s only a small segment of the permitting reform debate.

This week is likely to highlight the divisions.

And despite some optimism from key lawmakers — Sen. Martin Heinrich said this week that members of Congress are “more aligned” on permitting reform than on “some of the other spaces” — the potential for a deal could fizzle out at any point.

In the upper chamber, three Democratic senators said they won’t support any permitting reform legislation that doesn’t include stronger language about protecting renewables and building transmission infrastructure.

It’s prompted increasing concerns about Congress’ ability to compromise, which multiple lawmakers have said this year is going down the drain.

“There’s a drop-off in the number of bills passed out of Congress, not just this administration from previous administrations,” Szoka said. “I think what’s in the SPEED Act works. Now, we’ll see if it can get through the Senate.”",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/c597053/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1125+0+188/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2F75%2F85c9cc7b4f90886897ef49ac8cac%2Fhot-weather-100707027056.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:07.227852

The Office of Congressman Doug LaMalfa said the Forest Protection and Wildland Firefighter Safety Act passed the US House as part of a wider permitting reform package, the PERMIT Act, in Washington, D.C.

The office said the bill was introduced by Congressman Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale).

It said the bill is intended to keep aerial fire retardant available for wildfire response without Clean Water Act permitting delays.

Wildland Firefighter Safety and fire retardant use

The office said a 2023 federal court ruling imposed additional requirements linked to the use of aerial fire retardant by the U.S. Forest Service and other firefighting entities.

It said those restrictions risk slowing response times during wildfire incidents.

The office said the bill would clarify that a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is not required for the Forest Service to apply fire retardants from planes or helicopters to combat wildfires, if the retardants are on the current applicable Qualified Products List maintained by the Forest Service.

It said the provisions build on existing permitting exemptions for firefighting activities already in law.

Lawsuit background and permit timelines

The office said Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics sued the U.S. Forest Service in 2022 over the absence of an NPDES permit for aerially discharged fire retardant.

It said a federal court ruled in 2023 that the Forest Service must obtain an NPDES permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for aerial application of fire retardants.

It said the court did not grant the request for an injunction to block the Forest Service’s use of these products.

The office said Forest Service testimony to the House Natural Resources Committee in 2023 stated the agency believes an NPDES permit is not needed based on EPA guidance issued in 2003.

It said the Forest Service’s 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Record of Decision prohibits discharge into bodies of water and buffer areas around those waters.

It said the Forest Service stated that, over the past 10 years, less than 1% of retardant drops impacted American waterways.

It said the Forest Service stated the EPA could take up to three years to issue an NPDES permit, followed by state permitting across 47 states.

Comments from LaMalfa and the Forest Service

Rep. Doug LaMalfa said: “With wildfire season now practically year-round and more destructive than ever, preventing or limiting the use of any fire retardant because someone insists on a permit first is completely backwards.

“Aerial fire retardant has been used safely for decades and is already highly regulated.

“These lawsuits don’t protect the environment; they tie firefighters’ hands while fires race through forests and towards homes. I’m glad to see the PERMIT Act passed the House with my bill included. It ensures our crews can act quickly, without being tripped up by fringe litigation or years of paperwork.”

Tom Schultz, U.S. Forest Service Chief, said: “Aerially delivered long-term fire retardant is an essential tool the Forest Service and the interagency wildfire response community use in support of ground-based firefighting resources.

“We thank Chairman LaMalfa for leading legislation to ensure retardant remains a tool in the wildland firefighting toolbox to protect homes and communities from the devastating impacts of catastrophic wildland fire.”

What this could change for incident planning

Fire Chiefs and senior officers with responsibility for wildfire operations may track this measure because it focuses on continued access to aerial fire retardant as part of interagency response planning.

Government departments and emergency and disaster response managers may review how the bill’s approach aligns with existing Clean Water Act exemptions for firefighting runoff described in the source material.

Training officers and instructors involved in wildland tactics may also monitor the outcome because the Forest Service position in the material describes long-term retardant as supporting ground-based resources by altering how wildfire burns and slowing fire spread after water evaporates.

Fire engineering consultants and risk assessors working with public agencies may pay attention to the permitting timeline claims in the material, including the stated three-year federal process and additional state permits, when considering operational continuity and contingency planning.",https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lamalfa-fire-retardant.webp,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:12.386668

And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people.
The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average.
Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.
Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge?","Linda Perri has seen — and smelled — a lot in the more than 40 years she has lived in Washington Park in Providence. Some days are worse than others.

“You can’t open your windows in the summer, you can’t sit outside in your yard, front or back,” Linda Perri, who is president of her neighborhood association, said in a Nov. 14 interview.

For decades, many South Providence residents have suffered from pollution caused by industrial businesses on Allens Avenue and the Port. Some recall being awoken by the pungent odor of asphalt and experiencing nausea, headaches, and fatigue. In 2022, a school was even evacuated due to smells from the Port being mistaken for a gas leak. And though hundreds of air quality complaints have been made, Rhode Island has continued to prioritize economic profit over the wellbeing of its people. The time has come for the state to put the health of its people first and hold these entities accountable.

Allens Avenue, home to asphalt plants, scrap metal dealers, oil and gas companies, and salt distributors, has been called “the most toxic and polluted stretch of roadway in Rhode Island” by the Providence Streets Coalition, a group of over 40 community organizations, local businesses, schools, associations, and individuals supporting safe and healthy streets.

The impact of this pollution on surrounding communities is severe. The combination of noxious emissions from I-95 and pollution from businesses along Allens Avenue and the Port may contribute to Rhode Island’s asthma rate for adults exceeding the national average. In 2021, 12.6% of the state’s adult population had the condition, far above the national average of 9.7%. Rates among Rhode Island youth have decreased in recent years but were at 6.6% compared to the national average of 6.5%.

“It’s a struggle. There’s so much pollution. There’s so much road debris.” Perri said. “There’s a lot of things that could be done in this neighborhood to create a healthier, more environmentally-friendly port area.”

State officials are not doing enough to prevent bad actors from hurting the environment and these communities for their own monetary benefit. Since 2009, Rhode Island Recycled Metals has conducted its operations without proper permits from the state, contaminating the Providence River and Narragansett Bay with runoff and fuel from unlicensed vessels and defying stormwater discharge permits. Even after a series of fires led to its temporary closure in 2024, attempts to bring the company into compliance continue to fail. Meanwhile, nearby communities continue to pay the price.

Over the past few years, government action has shown that the state prioritizes the interests of these industrial businesses over the wellbeing of affected communities. In 2019, Mayor Jorge Elorza applauded the industrial waterfront as a “driver of economic development.” And when asked why some businesses in the area were not being held accountable by the city for environmental violations, Elorza’s office told ecoRI News that “the City is not responsible for air emissions or coastal regulations,” passing this responsibility to the DEM and Coastal Resources Management Council.

Mayor Brett Smiley’s 2024 Comprehensive Plan has taken a step in the right direction, but further action is needed. The plan emphasizes the development of clean and sustainable industries, laying out objectives to mitigate the environmental and health impacts of pollution. It also notes that “the city may prohibit future industrial uses in the General Industrial District, M-2, that it determines go against the public interest of public health and quality of life in near-industry neighborhoods.” However, will the state actually do this when the time comes? Or will more businesses like Rhode Island Recycled Metals be allowed to emerge? Without concrete accountability measures and enforcement strategies, these goals risk becoming empty words.

It is difficult to strike a balance between economic growth and public wellbeing, but it is essential that the state do so. Without immediate government intervention, the health of thousands of Rhode Islanders will remain at risk. Left to their own devices, these industrial businesses will continue to prioritize economic growth over public health.

Many residents worry that their voices will be drowned out by lobbyists and developers, who have greater influence in determining governmental outcomes. The state should propose an environmental justice law that will give residents in these communities a prominent voice in future developments. The state must enact legislation that reflects not only the interests of industrial developers, but also the concerns of those affected most acutely. Additionally, to decrease industrial operations in specific areas, the state should rezone parts of Allens Avenue and impose stricter penalties on businesses that violate environmental regulations.

I imagine a future where children can play outdoors without worrying about inhaling harmful pollutants – a future where every Rhode Islander has access to clean, healthy air. Thousands are counting on the state to act.

So the question I ask is this: Will it continue to prioritize economic growth over people’s health, or will it finally listen to the voices of those crying out for help and deliver justice to these communities?",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80416/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/img_0637-1-1024x7681765793212.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=lGTaWd_c,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:39.300706

Tubiana, who played a key role in the negotiations around the Paris Agreement, said that pressure from the Trump administration shouldn’t prevent the European Union from pursuing its climate goals of reaching climate neutrality by 2050.

Her appeal comes as the US pushes back against some key EU climate laws - such as the EU's carbon border tax - aiming to slash greenhouse gas emissions and encourage more sustainable practices outside of the European Union.

""I haven't seen anything like this in my whole life working on climate. I've never seen such aggressiveness from the US, including the pressure on Europe,"" Tubiana told Euronews.

She also noted that 85 countries at COP30 have shown political will to phase out fossil fuels, despite the US withdrawal from the United Nations climate summit.

""We have seen a major transformation of the world economy, in particular in green technology, the rise of China's investment in renewable energy, the fact that almost all countries have a climate law now since Paris, and 88% of global emissions are covered by a commitment to be net zero by the mid-century,"" Tubiana told Euronews.

For basically the whole month of January, a series of wildfires raged across Los Angeles, killing hundreds (more on that number below). On the other side of the country, an Arctic blast brought historic snowfall and bitter cold deep into the South. Then Donald Trump took office for a second time on January 20 and immediately began to unravel the climate progress the United States had made under Joe Biden.

The rest of the year, which is on track to tie for the second hottest on record, was just as momentous, bringing all manner of climate events — some good, some bad. In a lot of ways, we’ll look back on 2025 as a critical moment, both for the environment and humanity. Here’s why.

A firestorm consumes Los Angeles

Starting on January 7, wildfires continued for weeks and burned 78 square miles across Los Angeles, driven by strong winds and fueled by extra-dry vegetation. (The conflagration had climate change’s fingerprints all over it.) The fires destroyed more than 16,000 structures and forced more than 180,000 people to evacuate. In part because the blazes were burning through extremely affluent neighborhoods, the economic damages are estimated to be between $76 billion and $131 billion. The fires were 1 of 14 billion-dollar disasters to hit the U.S. in the first half of 2025, according to the research group Climate Central. (In May, the Trump administration announced that the federal government would stop tracking billion-dollar disasters, an essential way to assess climate risks.)

Officially, the fires killed 30 people. But this year, researchers got a better idea of just how bad wildfire smoke is for public health, as it exacerbates conditions like asthma and cardiovascular disease. In August, scientists published a new estimate of the L.A. wildfire death toll that factored in fatalities caused by the resulting haze: 440, or even higher. The next month, other researchers estimated that wildfire smoke already kills 40,000 Americans each year, which could soar to 71,000 by 2050 if humanity’s carbon emissions remain high. The flames themselves, it seems, kill but a small fraction of the fire’s total victims.

Trump takes takes a hatchet to environmental regulations

Los Angeles was still burning when Donald Trump was sworn in for a second time and quickly began overhauling government agencies and axing environmental rules. The Trump administration’s deep cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, could leave communities even more vulnerable to the threat of wildfire smoke. Later in the summer, Trump signed the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill into law, which among other things tore up the only climate plan the U.S. had. That killed the tax credits that consumers were using to electrify their homes and offset the cost of EVs, and destroyed the capital that Indigenous tribes were using to develop clean energy projects. (Also see Grist’s recent coverage of the weird ways that Trump has been changing the culture and language around energy and climate change.)

Extreme flooding is here to stay

Just as climate change is making wildfires worse, it’s actually making rainfall more catastrophic, too. That dynamic played out tragically on the Fourth of July weekend, when flash flooding struck central Texas, most devastatingly in Kerr County, killing at least 135 people. Part of the problem is that generally speaking, the warmer the atmosphere gets, the more moisture it can hold and eventually dump as rain. Making matters worse, the Gulf of Mexico has been exceptionally warm of late, which sent still more moisture into the atmosphere above Texas. (The same factors were fueling gnarly storms across the central and southern U.S. in the spring.) The resulting devastation is forcing a disaster-response reckoning not just in Kerr County but in similarly vulnerable communities across the U.S. Really, the world over is struggling to cope with extreme flooding: Storms and cyclones have killed more than 1,750 people in Asia since mid-November.

Data centers emerge as a major environmental threat

In 2025, another kind of human-made environmental disaster garnered growing scrutiny: data centers. In February, we reported on Georgia joining other states in extending the life of fossil-fuel power plants (which the Trump administration has also been forcing to stay open) to meet the tech industry’s extreme demand for electricity. The AI boom is hurting consumers, too: All that extra infrastructure is driving up electricity prices for households, especially in data-center hotspot states. The industry is such an environmental mess that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, suggested this summer that we build data centers in space instead.

Data centers are creating a water crisis, too: Nationwide in 2023, the facilities used 17 billion gallons of water directly to cool equipment, but they required more than 10 times that amount indirectly because they use so much electricity that’s generated elsewhere with steam. Accordingly, researchers at Cornell University this year found that the industry can reduce both its water and electricity footprints by building data centers where there’s abundant wind or solar energy, like West Texas.

Earth crosses an ominous planetary boundary and tipping point

This year scientists hit us with a one-two punch of bad environmental news: The crossing of the first “tipping point” and the breaching of another “planetary boundary.” A tipping point is when an Earth system suddenly and often irreversibly changes into something dramatically different, while a planetary boundary is a threshold that keeps the planet’s environments hospitable to life. Think of it like driving down a road, where the tipping point is an imminent cliff and a planetary boundary is a big sign warning of the drop.

In September, scientists announced that the seventh of nine boundaries had been crossed, this time the steady acidification of the oceans. (A quarter of humanity’s CO2 emissions have been absorbed by seawater, which creates carbonic acid.) That acidification is interfering with the ability of many organisms, like corals, mollusks, and crustaceans, to build their shells.

And speaking of corals, less than a month later, another team of researchers announced that the precipitous decline of reef ecosystems has pushed the planet to its first major tipping point. In the last 50 years, half of the world’s live coral cover has disappeared, as acidification pairs with rising ocean temperatures. All that stress causes corals to release the symbiotic algae that provide them energy, leading to coral bleaching. Even though corals are tipping, scientists are still breeding them in labs, hopefully finding varieties that can better stand the heat.

Countries cop-out at COP

You’d think that with such dire news about tipping points and planetary boundaries coming out, the world would get more ambitious about lowering its emissions. But 10 years after the Paris Agreement — which set out to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, or in an ideal world, 1.5 degrees — countries at the United Nations’ annual COP30 climate conference in November failed to come to an agreement on winding down fossil fuels. So we’re on track to get between 2.3 and 2.8 degrees of catastrophic warming by the end of this century, according to the U.N.’s own math. Every fraction of a degree means ever more severe effects of climate change — melting ice, sea level rise, extreme heat — and the further we go past 1.5 degrees, the more carbon we’ll have to remove from the atmosphere to bring temperatures back down to a safe level.

Hurricane season ends without a single US landfall

This spring, forecasters were looking at high ocean temperatures in the Atlantic — the fuel for hurricanes — and predicting an above-average season with around 10 named storms. But as the summer stretched on, the hurricanes that seemed headed for the mainland U.S. instead turned back out to sea. Hurricane season ended on November 30 without a single hurricane making landfall in the country for the first time in a decade, thanks to some atmospheric quirks above the Southeast.

The Caribbean, though, did not fare so well this year. At the end of October, Hurricane Melissa — supercharged by climate change — ravaged Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Because of extra-hot ocean waters, the storm’s maximum sustained wind speeds doubled from 70 mph to 140 mph in just 18 hours. So while it’s unusual for the U.S. to escape landfall for a whole season, tropical cyclones will only get worse from here as ocean temperatures climb: This was only the second year in recorded history to have spawned three or more Category 5 hurricanes.

Climate action has become unstoppable in many ways

Heading into 2026, it’s easy to look at all this and say, “Well, we’re borked.” Yes, the environment is buckling under the increasingly heavy burden of climate change. And yes, the Trump administration will continue its war on climate action. But unstoppable changes — the good kind — are already in motion that will help improve public health and reduce emissions, no matter what the federal government decrees.

For one, those environmental tipping points have positive counterparts that are now unfolding, thanks to local incentives and national policies elsewhere. The market share for new electric vehicles in Oslo, Norway, for instance, exploded from 13.6 percent to 95.8 percent in a decade, according to a report released in October. Solar panels have gotten so cheap that it’s now more economical to deploy renewables than to build more fossil fuel infrastructure. Accordingly, renewables are growing like crazy in the U.S. and beyond, with a new report finding that wind and solar are more than meeting the global rise in demand for electricity. Indeed, in the first half of 2025, renewables generated more electricity around the world than coal for the first time. The leaders of Africa’s growing economies, meanwhile, plotted a bold strategy this year to become a continent of climate solutions.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2149644773a.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-12-15 06:00:30.583163

Samsung E&A has signed a contract with DG Fuels, a US SAF project developer, for the clean energy facility basic design (FEED) for the Louisiana SAF Production Project. The company will execute the clean hydrogen production package from a total of two packages. The contract is valued at approximately KRW 23 billion (US$15.7 million) and will take approximately 10 months to complete. Samsung E&A aims to secure a linked contract for the main project upon completion of the basic design, with the total project size estimated at approximately US$3 billion (KRW 4.5 trillion).

This project, to be built in St. James Parish, Louisiana, US, will produce 600 000 tpy of SAF using abundant waste resources such as agricultural byproducts and woody biomass in the region as raw materials. Samsung E&A will be in charge of blue hydrogen facilities such as ASU (air separation unit), ATR (auto thermal reformer), and carbon dioxide capture, as well as green hydrogen facilities based on water electrolysis technology for this project.

With this contract, following the KRW 1.4 trillion Malaysian SAF order secured late last year, the company has fully entered the global SAF market.

Geothermal energy ​“is literally so sustainable — like, you could generate those megawatts forever.
At least one other northwest Colorado coal community is also getting on board with geothermal.
With dozens of communities warming to the notion, ​“it’s an exciting time for geothermal in Colorado,” said Bryce Carter, geothermal program manager at the state energy office.
After also accounting for a bonanza of state incentives, the $14-million project will only be $2.2 million, Mendisco said.","HAYDEN, Colo. — For decades, Dallas Robinson’s family excavation company developed coal mines and power plants in the rugged, fossil-fuel-rich region of northwest Colorado. It was a good business to be in, one that helped hamlets like Hayden grow from outposts to bustling mountain towns — and kept families like Robinson’s rooted in place for generations.

“This area, with the exception of agriculture, was built on oil and gas and coal,” said Robinson, a former town councilor for Hayden.

But that era is coming to a close. Across the United States, bad economics and even worse environmental impacts are driving coal companies out of business. The 441-megawatt coal-burning power plant just outside Hayden is no exception: It’s shutting down by the end of 2028. The Twentymile mine that feeds it is expected to follow.

Coal closures can gut communities like Hayden, a town of about 2,000 people. That story has been playing out for decades, particularly in Appalachia, where coal regions with depressed economies have seen populations decline as people strike out for better opportunities elsewhere. Robinson, a friendly, gregarious guy, fears the same could happen in Hayden.

“I grew up here, so I know everyone,” he said. ​“It’s hard to see people lose their jobs and have to move away. … These are families that sweat and bled and been through the good and the bad times in small towns like this.”

Struggling American coal towns need an economic rebirth as the fossil-fuel industry fades. Hayden has a vision that, at first, doesn’t sound all that unusual. The town is developing a 58-acre business and industrial park to attract a diverse array of new employers.

The innovative part: companies that move in will get cheap energy bills at a time of surging utility costs. The town is installing tech that’s still uncommon but gaining traction — a geothermal heating-and-cooling system, which will draw energy from 1,000 feet underground.

In short, Hayden is tapping abundant renewable energy to help invigorate its economy. That’s a playbook that could serve other communities looking to rise from the coal dust.

At an all-day event hosted by geothermal drilling startup Bedrock Energy this summer, I saw the ambitious project in progress. Under a blazing sun, a Bedrock drilling rig chewed methodically into the region’s ochre dirt. Once it finished this borehole — one of about 150 — it would feed in a massive spool of black pipe to transfer heat.

Bedrock will complete the project, providing 2 megawatts of thermal energy, in phases, with roughly half the district done in 2026 and the whole job finished by 2028. Along the way, constructed buildings will be able to connect with portions of the district as they’re ready.

“We see it as a long-term bet,” Mathew Mendisco, city manager of Hayden, later told me, describing the town as full of grit and good people. Geothermal energy ​“is literally so sustainable — like, you could generate those megawatts forever. You’re never going to have to be reliant on the delivery of coal or natural gas. … You drill it on-site, the heat comes out.”

Geothermal is also the rare renewable resource that the Trump administration has embraced. In July, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, whose firm invested in geothermal developer Fervo Energy, helped convince Congress to spare key federal investment tax credits for the sector.

These incentives apply to both the deep projects for producing power as well as the more accessible, shallower installations for keeping buildings comfy. Unlike geothermal projects for power, ones for direct heating and cooling don’t depend on geography; any town can take advantage of the resource.

“We disagree on the urgency of addressing climate change, [but] this is something that Chris Wright and I agree on,” Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper (D), a trained geologist, told a packed conference-room crowd on the day of the event. ​“Geothermal energy has … unbelievable potential to, at scale, create clean energy.”

Charting a post-coal economy

The eventual closure of the Hayden Station coal plant, which has operated for more than half a century, has loomed over the town since Xcel Energy announced an early shutdown in 2021.

The power plant and the mine employ about 240 people. Property taxes from those businesses have historically provided more than half the funding for the town’s fire management and school districts — though that fraction is shrinking thanks to recent efforts to diversify Hayden’s economy, Mendisco said.

Taking into account the other businesses that serve the coal industry and its workers, according to Mendisco, the economic fallout from the closures is projected to be a whopping $319 million per year.

“Really, the highest-paying jobs, the most stable jobs, with the best benefits [and] the best retirement, are in coal and coal-fired power plants,” Robinson said.

But coal has been in decline for over 20 years, largely due to growing investment in cheap fossil gas and renewables. While the Trump administration tries to defibrillate the coal industry and force uneconomic coal plants to stay open past their planned closure dates, states including Colorado still plan to phase out fossil fuels in the coming years. Colorado’s remaining six coal plants are set to shutter by the end of the decade.

Hayden aims for its business park to help the town weather this transition. With 15 lots to be available for purchase, the development is designed to provide more than 70 jobs and help offset a portion of the tax losses from Hayden Station’s closure, according to Mendisco.

“We are not going to sit on our hands and wait for something to come save us,” Mayor Ryan Banks told me at the event.

Companies that move into the business park won’t have a gas bill. They’ll be insulated from fossil-fuel price spikes, like those that occurred in December 2022, when gas prices leapt in the West and customers’ bills skyrocketed by 75% on average from December 2021.

In the Hayden development, businesses will be charged for their energy use by the electric utility and by a geothermal municipal utility that Hayden is forming to oversee the thermal energy network. Rather than forcing customers to pay for the infrastructure upfront, the town will spread out those costs on energy bills over time — like investor-owned utilities do. Unlike a private utility, though, Hayden will take no profit. Mendisco said he expects the geothermal district to cut energy costs by roughly 40%, compared with other heating systems.

The setup will deliver such massive savings because geothermal appliances, which draw energy from the always-temperate Earth, are the most efficient space-conditioning tech you can get. They pump out the same amount of heat as a fossil-fuel-fired furnace while using just one-sixth to one-quarter of the energy.

Municipally owned geothermal districts are rare in the U.S., but the approach has legs. Pagosa Springs, Colorado, has run its geothermal network since the early 1980s, when it scrambled to combat fuel scarcity during the 1970s oil embargo. New Haven, Connecticut, recently broke ground on a geothermal project for its train station and a new public housing complex. And Ann Arbor, Michigan, has plans to build a geothermal district to help make one neighborhood carbon-neutral.

Hayden’s infrastructure investment is already attracting business owners. An industrial painting company has bought a plot, and so has a regional alcohol distributor, Mendisco said.

One couple is particularly excited to be a part of the town’s clean energy venture. Nate and Steph Yarbrough own DIY off-grid-electrical startup Explorist.Life; renewable power is in the company’s DNA. The Yarbroughs teach people how to put solar panels and batteries on camper vans, boats, and cabins to fuel their outdoor adventures, and Explorist.Life sells the necessary gear.

“When we bought that property, it was largely because of the whole geothermal concept,” Nate Yarbrough told me. ​“We thought it made a whole bunch of sense with what we do.”

Reducing reliance on hydrocarbons, he noted, is ​“a good thing for society overall.”

Geothermal tech heats up

The geothermal network that could transform Hayden’s future is mostly invisible from aboveground. Besides the drilling rig and a trench, the most prominent features I spotted were flexible tubes jutting from the earth like bunny ears.

Those ends of buried U-shaped pipes will eventually connect to a main distribution loop for businesses to hook up to. Throughout the network, pipes will ferry a nontoxic mix of water and glycol — a heat-carrying fluid that electric heat pumps can tap to keep buildings toasty in the winter and chilled in the summer.

Despite their superior efficiency, these heat pumps are far less common than the kind that pull from the ambient air, largely due to project cost. Because you have to drill to install a ground-source heat pump, the systems are typically about twice as expensive as air-source heat pumps.

But the underground infrastructure lasts 50 years or more, and the systems pay for themselves in fuel-cost savings more quickly in places that endure frostier temperatures, including Rocky Mountain municipalities like Hayden. Those long-term cost benefits were too attractive to ignore, Mendisco said.

Hayden’s project ​“is 100% replicable today,” Mendisco told attendees at the event, which included leaders of other mountain towns. Geothermal tech is ready; the money is out there, he added: ​“You can do this.”

Colorado certainly believes that — and it’s giving first-mover communities a boost.

In October, the state energy office announced $7.3 million in merit-based tax-credit awards for four geothermal projects. Vail is getting nearly $1.8 million for a network, into which the ice arena can dump heat and the library can soak it up. Colorado Springs will use its $5 million award to keep a downtown high school comfortable year-round. Steamboat Springs and a Denver neighborhood will share the rest of the funding.

At least one other northwest Colorado coal community is also getting on board with geothermal. In the prior round of state awards, the energy office granted $58,000 to the town of Craig’s Memorial Regional Health to explore a project for its medical campus.

With dozens of communities warming to the notion, ​“it’s an exciting time for geothermal in Colorado,” said Bryce Carter, geothermal program manager at the state energy office.

So far, the state has pumped $30.5 million into geothermal developments — with over $27 million going toward heating-and-cooling projects specifically — through its grant and tax-credit programs. The larger tax-credit incentive still has about $13.8 million left in its coffers.

Hayden, for its part, is also taking advantage of the federal tax credits to save up to 50% on the cost of its geothermal district. That includes a 10% bonus credit that the community qualifies for because of its coal legacy. After also accounting for a bonanza of state incentives, the $14-million project will only be $2.2 million, Mendisco said.

Hayden is likely just at the start of its geothermal journey. If all goes well with the business park, the town aims to retrofit its municipal buildings with these systems to comply with the state’s climate-pollution limits on big buildings, Mendisco said. Hayden’s community center could be the first to get a geothermal makeover starting in 2027, he added.

Robinson, despite coal’s salience in the region and his family’s legacy in its extraction, believes in Hayden’s vision: Geothermal could be a winner in a post-coal economy. In fact, he’s interested in investing in the geothermal industry and installing a system in a new house he’s building, he said.

“I’ve lived a lot of my life making a living by exploiting natural resources. I understand the value of that — as well as lessening our impact and being able to find new and better,” Robinson said. ​“This is the next step, right?”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Hayden-CO-geothermal-drilling-Bedrock-Brooke-Ashlee.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=2286049566b1d48a0829ebcddcd08847,N,,2025-12-15 06:57:51.947690

Northern Indiana Public Service Company’s 722-megawatt R.M. Schahfer plant, in the small town of Wheatfield, is supposed to close this month. So is CenterPoint Energy’s 90-megawatt F.B. Culley 2, along the Ohio River in southern Indiana.

But the utilities explained to state regulators during a December 2 biannual hearing on reliability that they are preparing for potential Trump administration orders to keep the units operating, and some fear such mandates could come any day.

Already this year, the Department of Energy has forced a coal plant in Michigan and an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania to operate past scheduled retirement dates.

The Trump administration has said coal plants need to stay open to address energy shortages. The Federal Power Act allows the government to temporarily order power plants to operate in case of such an emergency. Indiana Gov. Mike Braun (R) issued an executive order in April echoing the president’s concerns and promising to evaluate and ​“consider extending the life” of every coal plant in the state.

Community leaders say keeping Schahfer or Culley online will mean unacceptable and unnecessary health risks and costs.

Braun’s executive order notes that 9 gigawatts of coal-fired power are scheduled to retire between 2025 and 2038 in Indiana.

“Now we’re concerned about every single coal plant in the state [scheduled for] retiring,” said Ben Inskeep, program director of the Citizens Action Coalition, which represents consumers statewide. ​“Utilities are facing extreme pressure to keep coal plants open from the political powers that be.”

Coal ash intrigue

At the recent reliability hearing, NIPSCO CEO and chief operating officer Vince Parisi told regulators that he was taking steps to be ready for an emergency order to keep running Schahfer, including checking on coal supply and equipment needed to make major repairs to one of the plant’s units, which has been offline since July.

In June, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approved a settlement agreement stating the Schahfer plant will close this year. Utility spokesperson Jessica Cantarelli affirmed to Canary Media that ​“absent a directive to stay open, NIPSCO is on track to retire R.M. Schahfer’s remaining two coal units by the end of 2025.”

But documents show that NIPSCO has not only prepared to run the plant longer but also sought a means to do so.

Fred Gomos, senior director of environmental policy and sustainability at NIPSCO’s parent company, NiSource, emailed the Environmental Protection Agency in early August asking for an extension on a deadline to stop dumping toxic coal ash in an unlined waste pond. Later that month, Gomos followed up with the EPA and mentioned that the company had met with Department of Energy officials about the issue.

Gomos said the coal ash extension was necessary for the company to ​“justify” capital investments to keep the plant operating. On November 25, the EPA proposed granting the extension to Schahfer and 10 other plants nationwide. Twelve plants had previously requested exceptions to a 2021 deadline to stop putting waste in unlined repositories, which often leak contaminants into groundwater; one was denied. The other requests were never granted, but their filings allowed the plants to put ash in unlined ponds through October 2028. The EPA’s recent proposal, which is open for public comment through January 7, 2026, would allow the 11 plants to dump coal ash in unlined ponds through October 2031.

Cantarelli said Schahfer’s ​“retirement has not been impacted by EPA’s proposal to extend coal ash–related compliance deadlines,” and did not respond to a question about Gomos’ email seeking the extension.

The EPA proposal noted, ​“NIPSCO has stated that RM Schahfer would operate its coal-fired boilers until 2028 if the proposed rule change was finalized.” A correction issued December 1 clarified that NIPSCO said it ​“could potentially operate coal-fired boilers until 2028.”

Three coal plants in Illinois, two in Louisiana, two in Texas, and one each in Ohio, Utah, and Wyoming would also be covered by the coal ash extension.

Earthjustice senior attorney Lisa Evans explained that while a 2020 Biden administration rule created the extension through 2028, the EPA never ruled on the plants’ requests. In her view, that makes the proposed extension to 2031 an illegal way that the Trump administration is trying to prolong the life of coal plants.

“The rule did not just give extensions to coal plants to operate unlined surface impoundments with no strings attached,” Evans said. ​“The plants had to meet specific criteria to be able to continue to operate those unlined impoundments. The Trump administration has not evaluated their compliance and whether they have adequately remediated groundwater contamination.”

Monitoring data reported by NIPSCO shows molybdenum, arsenic, and other contaminants at high levels in groundwater near the Schahfer plant’s unlined pond.

“EPA has to make sure these utilities are operating in a way that’s protective of health and the environment,” Evans said. ​“They’ve thrown that out the window for the purported reason of throwing more energy into the grid.”

Reliability race

Three times this year, the Trump administration has ordered the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to keep running for stretches of 90 days past its planned retirement, most recently on November 18. The extension has cost ratepayers $615,000 per day, even as studies show that no energy-shortage emergency exists.

The federal National Energy Regulatory Commission has found that there is an adequate supply of electricity this winter to power the grid that covers Michigan and Indiana.

NERC’s recent reliability report found ​“limited risk” in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s grid, adding that the grid operator has procured more energy than required.

Data centers for AI are expected to steeply increase electricity demand in coming years, but experts say aging coal plants are not the way to meet that demand. The Schahfer and Culley plants, for example, are hardly well suited to provide significant reliable power.

The Culley plant is CenterPoint’s ​“smallest and most inefficient coal unit,” the company noted in a 2025 planning summary. Shane Bradford, vice president of CenterPoint’s Indiana Electric, told regulators in the December 2 hearing that the company had enough coal to continue running the plant if forced to.

“We are very concerned this unit could be the target of a [Federal Power Act] 202(c) order this month, given the very assertive stance the Trump and Braun administrations are taking on preventing any coal plant from retiring,” Inskeep said about Culley.

The Schahfer unit that has been offline since July 9 because of turbine problems will need to be ​“rebuilt” over about six months in order to keep operating, Parisi told regulators. Schahfer’s other coal unit also had outages for hundreds of hours over the summer, caused by leaks in boiler equipment, said David Saffran, NIPSCO generation business systems administrator in the operations management reporting.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/2048px-Schafer_9908.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1f809169a5c481455cef23cfdff27f4e,N,,2025-12-15 04:57:33.549450

As India chases an ambitious target of 15 per cent EV penetration in new vehicle sales by 2030, supply chain constraints are emerging as a major roadblock. According to BYD India’s leadership, demand, charging infrastructure and regulations all matter, but the real test will be whether manufacturers can source key components reliably and at the right cost. In their view, the supply chain is the link that will decide whether the 2030 goals are met or missed.

Battery dependence and limited local capacity

The pressure is most visible on the battery side. India still depends heavily on imported batteries and critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel. These global supply chains are under pressure from rising worldwide demand and are exposed to geopolitical risks and price swings.

Current battery manufacturing capacity within India is not enough to support the projected demand from 30 to 40 million electric vehicles expected to be on Indian roads by 2030. Domestic companies like Exide and Lithium Werks are expanding their facilities, but their timelines and volumes do not yet match the aggressive growth targets being discussed by policymakers and the auto industry. Until more large-scale local plants come on stream, battery supply will remain a constraint and keep EV costs elevated.

Chips, motors and slow localisation

The stress is not limited to batteries. The flow of semiconductor chips, electric motor components and power electronics is also fragmented. A large share of these parts is imported from East Asia. Any disruption there, whether due to geopolitical tension, natural disasters or economic slowdowns, can quickly translate into production cuts in India.

The auto industry has long relied on just in time manufacturing to keep inventory costs low. That approach leaves very little buffer when shipments are delayed or diverted. For EVs, which depend on a more complex mix of electronic and electrical parts than conventional cars, this lack of cushion can halt production lines and delay deliveries.

Localisation efforts are under way but have been slower than first expected. When the FAME II scheme was launched, there was an assumption that major global battery makers and component suppliers would set up large plants in India within a few years. Instead, many have delayed full scale entry or are operating pilot facilities rather than committing to big capacities. As a result, Indian OEMs are still absorbing higher imported component costs, which they cannot always pass on to buyers without making EVs look too expensive next to petrol and diesel models.

Skills, scale and the 2030 gap

There is also a human capital gap to deal with. Building and assembling EV drivetrains needs a different skill set compared to traditional internal combustion powertrains. Factories require technicians, engineers and shop floor workers who are trained in high voltage systems, battery pack assembly and specialised electronics. Training programmes are growing, but not at the speed required if production has to scale rapidly over the next few years.

A shortage of skilled personnel can lead to quality issues and slower ramp up, which in turn damages consumer confidence if early buyers face reliability problems. That risk is taken seriously in a market where many households are still buying their first EV and want a hassle-free ownership experience.

BYD’s optimism about reaching 1,000 monthly EV sales in India shows that individual manufacturers believe they can work through these issues by improving efficiency and building scale. However, moving from those numbers to the volumes needed for 15 per cent EV penetration will require the entire ecosystem to move together. That means everyone from mining companies extracting lithium to local battery and motor manufacturers, software developers working on EV management systems and logistics providers moving parts around the country.

Right now, these pieces are not fully aligned. Until India can build a more cohesive and resilient supply chain for EV components, the 2030 targets will remain more aspirational than assured, even if buyer interest and policy support continue to grow.",https://cdn.cartoq.com/photos/cars_at_stockyard_3da0c4bbe7.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 05:59:13.517997

From an early and productive planting season to a warm May and a wet June, it felt like farmers were set up for another incredible year of record-breaking yields.

Time will tell whether statewide yields were a record, but many farmers felt the pinch of tight commodity markets, heavy disease pressure and other crop issues as the summer and fall went on. After such a strange year, what should we learn from for 2026, and what should we leave behind?

Take it with you

Here are some actions you’ll want to continue in 2026:

1. Plant early. Early planting has always been a priority for corn, but soybeans are now competing for that priority spot. Corn yield potential has a steeper drop-off as we enter mid-May. So, if soil temperature and moisture conditions are good, with a forecast trending warmer, prioritize corn ahead of soybean in 2026.

2. Establish strong herbicide programs. Herbicide programs shined in 2025, with all the rainfall putting pressure on residuals and continued weed emergence through the summer. Focus on a preemergence mixture that will perform against the weed spectrum in your fields, and examine rates closely to make sure you have sufficient active ingredient to control weeds.

3. Don’t stop scouting. Consistent crop scouting led to timely and effective pesticide application decisions in 2025. As margins become tighter, one of the most effective ways to spend money wisely is to spend time scouting before making expensive input decisions.

4. Prepare for volunteer corn. One of the most interesting end-of-season surprises in 2025 was the volunteer corn cover crop left behind from early harvest. It’s hard to say for certain whether more corn will continue to germinate in 2026, but this may be something we can’t fully leave behind in 2025. Plan for the potential of more volunteer corn in 2026 by checking herbicide traits of your hybrids and having a plan in place.

Forget it

Here are some things to leave behind in 2025:

1. Focusing on southern rust. Southern rust cannot overwinter in Iowa or anywhere in the U.S. Although this disease was a big problem in 2025, we shouldn’t make it a focus of our 2026 plans, as it takes a very special combination of weather events for southern rust to spread and establish here. In 2024 and 2025, southern rust was first found in mid-July, but it was not a major problem due to the different weather conditions.

2. Making multiple fungicide applications. Multiple fungicide applications in a season, even timely ones, are unlikely to create positive return on investment in our environment, except in the very unusual case of the 2025 growing season. With fungicide product and application upward of $30 per application for even less-expensive mixtures, each application should return at least eight to 10 bushels per acre to pay for itself. Plan for timely crop scouting and applying fungicide during the VT- to R2-growth stage based on the disease triangle (susceptible hybrid, disease presence and favorable environment) to be successful in 2026.

3. Spending money with little research. Spending money on biological products with little independent research support may be a useful on-farm endeavor when commodity prices are high, but in a time of tight margins, dollars are better invested in products with reliable returns, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and lime. If you haven’t been applying sulfur and you’re interested in trying something new, apply a sulfur product (in sulfate form) to corn in the spring at a rate of 15 to 20 pounds per acre, and leave some test strips to determine if it had a yield effect.

As part of the TaiyangNews Leadership Talks, GREW Solar’s Chief Operating Officer (COO), Hardip Singh, spoke to TaiyangNews about the company’s strategic path forward at the Renewable Energy India Expo 2025 (REI 2025) in Greater Noida.

GREW exhibited its current product portfolio at the event, including the newly launched G12R module and a full-black module earlier introduced at RE+ in the US. The full-black module is designed specifically for the US market, shared Singh. Based on TOPCon cell technology, with a cell size of G12R, Singh said there is higher power output without significantly increasing module size. As a result, the new module can achieve power ratings of up to 635 W, compared to around 590 W with M10 cells.

Because the module dimensions remain largely unchanged, it is suitable not only for utility-scale projects but also for rooftop and residential installations. The higher wattage enables greater power generation from the same rooftop area.

In terms of manufacturing capacity, GREW currently operates 6.5 GW of module manufacturing capacity at its Jaipur facility. It plans to add another 4.5 GW in the near future, taking total module capacity to around 11 GW by the end of 2026. On the cell side, Grew Energy is setting up a 3 GW facility in Narmadapuram, which is planned to be expanded to 8 GW by the end of 2026. This production will be used both for internal consumption and for sales to customers.

At present, GREW is focused entirely on TOPCon technology. However, the company acknowledges the rapid pace of technological change in the solar industry. It continues to monitor future technologies such as HJT, back contact (BC) cells, and perovskites, too. Singh shared that the manufacturing equipment installed at GREW’s facilities is designed to be upgradeable, allowing a swift transition when new technologies become commercially viable and widely adopted. “So technologically we will be ready,” stressed Singh.

Regarding exports, the company stated that earlier capacity constraints limited its ability to focus on international markets. Until recently, GREW operated with around 3 GW of capacity, which was insufficient to meet the domestic demand. With expanded capacity now coming online, the company is actively pursuing exports and has already participated in RE+ in the US. Singh said that its target export markets include the US, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa.

On India’s solar manufacturing ecosystem, Grew Energy expressed appreciation for government support through policy initiatives such as ALMM, domestic manufacturing incentives, and demand-side schemes like PM-KUSUM and PM Surya Ghar. However, the company emphasized the need for long-term policy stability. As investments in cells, wafers, and ingots are highly capital-intensive, stable and predictable policies are essential to build confidence among manufacturers, lenders, and other stakeholders across the ecosystem.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-12-15%2Foqvdiklu%2FGrew-Energy-.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-12-15 05:59:52.673113

These examples just scratch the surface of our commitment to improving quality and affordability for people across North Carolina.
Our Commitment to North Carolina Runs Deep Our name reflects more than a brand or a location.
Blue Cross NC is here for North Carolina.","Many adults today feel as if they are navigating life alone. People feel disconnected from each other and uncertain about the institutions that should help them in their daily lives. Health care can, and should, provide clarity and comfort, yet it often adds to the strain. It is confusing, expensive, and difficult to navigate. A recent poll found that nearly a third of adults skipped or postponed care in the past year. When the system that should support people instead pushes them away, minor issues can escalate into serious problems and overall costs rise for everyone.

These challenges affect physical and mental health and place pressure on household finances. They are especially intense in North Carolina, which is one of the most expensive states for care and where nearly every county faces shortages of health care professionals.

North Carolinians need to know that someone is in their corner, ready to listen and work on their behalf to make high quality care more affordable and more accessible. What does true partnership look like? What does it mean to advocate for communities in a meaningful way?

Innovation

Several years ago, Blue Cross NC recognized that the fee-for-service model was driving costs upward and slowing progress. We became one of the leaders guiding North Carolina toward value-based care. Instead of paying simply for the number of services provided, we build payment incentives around results. This model—which depends on close partnership with providers–encourages prevention, coordination, and data informed care that reduces chronic conditions, avoidable hospitalizations, and unnecessary emergency room visits. The shift has produced major quality gains and close to $1 billion dollars in shared savings.

Our innovations don’t just transform how care is paid for. They also improve how care is delivered:

For several years, we’ve also been a leading force promoting food is medicine programs for improving health. Blue Cross NC collaborated with UNC Health to publish a first-of-its-kind clinical study evaluating the health impacts and strategies for delivering healthy food to those experiencing food insecurity. We’ve also just launched a new Health Through Food statewide initiative to reduce chronic conditions and fight the rising costs of care across North Carolina through fresh and healthy food.

We offer tools that help members understand costs and manage their health care spending, including our Cost Estimator tool and our collaboration with Sempre Health, which improves medication adherence and lowers long term costs.

Our More Than a Script program reimburses independent pharmacists who take an active role in managing chronic diseases, like hypertension and diabetes.

We are committed to improving our systems to make it easier for members to access the right care at the right time.

We’ve been pioneers in the use of predictive analytics to enhance our care management team’s ability to engage at-risk members and get them started on focused, strategic support programs that minimize or eliminate health risks early, before they lead to a crisis situation.

These examples just scratch the surface of our commitment to improving quality and affordability for people across North Carolina.

Local Connection and Collaboration

True partnership requires deep and sustained local engagement. Our work on Health Through Food and other initiatives is possible because of strong relationships with community organizations throughout the state.

Blue Cross NC has been part of North Carolina’s fabric for nearly a century. Our presence reaches far beyond our headquarters in Durham.

Most of our employees live in the communities they serve.

Our County Engagement team directly supports all 100 counties.

Our Beyond Blue Neighborhood Centers provide local support and space for community activity.

Our Extra Miles Tour took our leadership team to every county to meet with educators, providers, and local leaders and to understand community-level needs and opportunities.

We’ve forged long-lasting partnerships with universities, community colleges, and local organizations to help expand access to care in rural areas and help us support members during critical moments. Onsite care navigators in high volume hospitals have assisted more than 7,000 members since September 2024 and generated an estimated $32 million in savings through better guidance and improved recovery and discharge planning.

We also stand with North Carolinians during times of crisis, including the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. For us, partnership with communities is not an optional strategy. It is the only path to long-lasting solutions.

Flexibility to Provide Tailored Solutions

History alone does not make a true community partner. Flexibility and responsiveness matter. Blue Cross NC listens, learns, and adjusts as needs evolve.

Our relationship with the NC Chamber recently produced Carolina HealthWorks, which gives small businesses access to the rate advantages typically reserved for large employer groups. We have formed similar collaborations with the North Carolina Retail Merchants Association, the NC Home Builders Association, and the NC Bar Association.

We also work with community health organizations to address urgent public health challenges. Examples include installing Narcan distribution kiosks in high need areas and partnering with Ripe for Revival to bring nutritious food, health screenings, and education directly to residents.

Our Commitment to North Carolina Runs Deep

Our name reflects more than a brand or a location. It represents our purpose. We stand with our members and the communities we serve. We advocate for their needs. We demonstrate this commitment not just in the products we sell or through the services we provide to our customers. This commitment is visible in the thousands of volunteer hours our employees contribute each year and in our three statewide initiatives focused on youth mental health, food is medicine, and rural access to care.

It is also visible in the work of the independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina Foundation, which has invested in our communities through grants, partnerships, and initiatives.

There is more work to do, yet every step forward strengthens our state and enhances our ability to deliver better and more affordable care for our communities.

In the end, our model performs well in terms of identifying image features that resemble empty spacing between PV panels as well as PV panels themselves.
Metrics The typical nomenclature used in existing literature quantifies land-use efficiency in terms of land area “transformation” and “occupation” metrics.","Renewable energy sources are an important conduit through which energy-related greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced, particularly photovoltaics (PV) due to the abundant and ubiquitous nature of solar energy1,2,3. Despite having only generated 3.2% (856 TWh) of global electricity generation in 2020, the PV industry has maintained high growth rates for the past decade and its cumulative capacity may reach ten terawatts by 20304,5. The growth of ground-mounted PV may experience land constraints, yet the degree to which it may be constrained has yet been confirmed due to inconsistent methodologies and a lack of comprehensive datasets. Further, ambitious solar energy development could potentially create unanticipated knock-on effects on land use on a global scale if existing land uses are displaced, highlighting the importance of optimizing co-use of land. As the world transforms its energy system toward lower carbon and renewable sources, understanding not only the benefits but also how to overcome potential drawbacks of solar PV has important implications for sustainability. Our analysis contributes a transparent and systematic method to quantify land-solar interactions and comprehensive dataset of to be scientifically accurate 719 solar power PV projects in the U.S. portion of the Western Interconnection.

The installation of solar PV projects captures free and abundant solar irradiance over large parcels of land which are neither free nor unlimited. The issue of land use has been perceived as a limitation to the large-scale growth of ground-mounted solar power, with early studies suggesting that it can compromise the overall sustainability and return on investment of solar energy systems6,7,8. A total of 32 environmental impacts have been linked to the utilization of solar energy, indicating that high growth in solar power may result in unintended consequences to various environmental impact categories9. At the same time, solar energy has been noted as having both lower and higher land use in comparison to wind and fossil fuel powered electricity using life cycle assessment (LCA), a cradle-to-grave analysis of the impacts of products and processes10,11. Land transformation (square meters per megawatt hour \((\frac{{m}^{2}}{{MWh}})\)) serves as an important baseline metric for LCA in terms of area per unit of electricity generated. The quantification of land-solar interactions can enable an understanding of how to ameliorate impacts while supporting techno-ecological synergies6,12,13,14,15,16,17; this framework to engineer solutions that benefit both solar technologies and ecological systems by design has become a major thrust of research in recent years. Transforming our perspective on systems design can ensure that solar energy is developed to align with both climate and sustainable development goals (SDGs)18.

Beyond LCA, inconsistent metrics, data, study boundaries, and methods have produced conflicting results for land-energy interactions6,19,20,21. Over short timescales (e.g., <10 years), renewable energy systems have been noted as much more land-intensive than fossil-fuel-based systems10,22,23,24. Solar power has also been noted as having lower scores in capacity-based land use efficiency (watts of installed capacity per square meter \((\frac{{W}_{c}}{{m}^{2}})\)) and generation-based land use efficiency (watts of operational capacity per square meter \((\frac{{W}_{o}}{{m}^{2}})\))11 in comparison to non-renewable alternatives with strong dependence on geographical locations25. Such results overlook the fact that renewable power can increase its cumulative electricity produced without expanding its land footprint whereas non-renewable power requires the continual development of new land for fuel extraction26. Furthermore, solar PV facilities can increase their land use efficiency by having higher packing factor—the ratio of PV array area to total site area for a facility27. Considering the implicit time factor in land-use metrics, renewable energy sources can have comparable or even lower land impacts when compared to fossil counterparts when examined over longer timescales, such as the average lifetime of solar projects (30 years)10,24,28. Solar power can reach land equivalency (i.e., the amount of time it takes for fossil-fuel-based systems and renewable power systems to have the equivalent land footprint and cumulative energy production) with natural gas and coal alternatives in less than a decade10,24.

Systematic research that quantifies the land-solar interactions covering large populations of PV projects across extensive tracts of land remains relatively limited. Existing analyses rely on relatively small datasets (e.g., <200 power plants in Hernandez et al.6) or present results focused on the direct panel area rather than the total project site29,30,31 (i.e., including the panels and all land use up to the project fence line), limiting the ability to directly use findings to confirm the land-use impacts associated with current and future solar energy generation24. Without readily available data describing the land use of solar PV facilities, the potential higher-order, indirect effects of solar land use on the global scale become even more difficult to measure. Furthermore, the variable use of metrics in existing literature prevents broad consensus about land-solar interactions, which can be circumvented by adopting a transparent methodology and consistent set of metrics21. Our analysis of the 719 U.S. solar PV projects (Fig. 1) contributes a systematic and replicable methodology that produced a dataset quantifying the resulting land transformation (the land area altered by the solar facility per unit of energy produced during its 30-year lifetime) and land-use efficiency (the land area altered per unit of installed nameplate capacity or electricity generation). The power plants in our sample are all connected to the U.S. Western Interconnection, which occupies an area rich in solar energy in terms of global horizontal irradiance (GHI in \({kWh}/\frac{{m}^{2}}{{year}}\))—a close proxy for the total endowment of solar resources available at each given location on the earth’s surface.

By combining deep learning and energy systems analysis, we present a workflow that can be broadly applied to solve inconsistencies in the quantification of land-solar interactions while elucidating the use of the built environment. While previous studies have documented efforts to localize and create inventories of solar PV installations in the U.S.29,31,32,33,34,35,36,37, access to the resulting data has been limited33,34,36 and the annotation of solar PV installations has been focused on the panel arrays29). We introduce a replicable and efficient machine-learning-based approach for analyzing land-use associated with solar PV that differentiates between the panel array area and the full project area of solar PV facilities. Our approach is applicable across diverse regions and installation types, not only generating robust datasets but also providing consistent metrics and transparent, replicable methods that offer critical insights for resolving inconsistencies in LCA and other macro-scale energy analyses.

We examined 719 utility-scale solar PV facilities from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) records that are connected to the Western Interconnection (Fig. 1a). Each of our utility-scale facilities has a nameplate capacity of at least 1 megawatt as defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA)38, with the median, mean, and total nameplate capacity being 3.5 megawatts, 19.7 megawatts, and 13,272 megawatts respectively. Our dataset also includes 110 utility-scale rooftop PV installations, predominantly situated on substantial structures such as university campuses, government laboratories, and corporate facilities, averaging 2.1 megawatts in nameplate capacity and comprising 1.8% (236.3 megawatts) of the total analyzed capacity. Our results suggest that solar projects examined in the study area cover 538 \({{{\mathrm{km}}}}^{2}\) of land, 416 \({{{\mathrm{km}}}}^{2}\) of which is covered by solar panels. Our PV panel footprint results show strong alignment with prior works completed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (USPVDB)30,31 (Fig. 2). Out of the 719 solar PV facilities examined in our study area, 252 and 609 were once examined by the aforementioned studies (Fig. 1b). When comparing across the same PV projects, our estimation for the area of PV panel arrays is close to that of the existing data. The minor differences can be attributed to three factors: 1) the later expansion in capacity for some projects after 2015; 2) inconsistent geopositioning of specific projects; and 3) different methods in accounting for the gap separating PV panel arrays. Specifically, solar arrays separated by more than 30 meters are annotated as separate polygons in the 2016 USGS data while arrays are examined on a case-by-case basis using our approach (see methods). Differences in methods point to the need for judicious use of results from different studies as they may not have been produced with commensurable methods. Our approach provides the land-use footprint of not only the panel area but also that of the entire solar PV facility by evidence of fencing, which is largely missing from existing data29,30,31,32. This additional information allows us to evaluate PV array spacing using the packing factor metric—the ratio of panel array footprint to that of the entire facility27. An evaluation of the 719 solar PV facilities shows a median and capacity-weighted average packing factor of 74% and 75%, respectively.

The land transformation for solar PV projects in U.S. states is, of course, influenced by the available solar resources (Fig. 3a, b). Specifically, the average land transformation of PV facilities is lower by 16% in the U.S. Southwest (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah) than in the Northwest (Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming). When evaluated in terms of capacity- and generation-based land use efficiency, Southwestern PV facilities outperform those located in the Northwest by 22% and 36%, respectively (Fig. 3c–f). The PV projects in Arizona and El Paso, Texas on average are the best performers among all projects in our sample. For both land transformation and land use efficiency metrics, evaluating PV projects solely on the footprint of solar arrays yields better performance results than estimates based on the total project footprint, which has important implications for future studies on PV power considering the balance of system for PV projects is increasingly likely to include potentially land-consuming subjects such as utility-scale battery packs. On average, the 609 ground-based solar PV facilities have a capacity- and generation-based land use efficiency of 24.7 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\) and 5.8 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\). Accounting for the varying installed capacity of PV projects, our results show a capacity- and generation-weighted average land use efficiency of 25.4 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\) and 6.9 \(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\), updating prior estimates27. The average lifetime land transformation for the examined facilities is 0.85 \(\frac{{m}^{2}}{{MWh}}\). Rooftop installations are excluded from these land-use calculations derived from project footprints, due to the absence of clearly and exclusively defined project site areas for these installations but are available in the published dataset.

Results differ between PV facilities using different mounting systems. On average, PV panel arrays on dual-axis tracking systems outperform their fixed-rack and single-axis neighbors within the same state by 25% and 39%, respectively in terms of land transformation (Fig. 4a). However, in terms of total land transformation for the entire project site, PV facilities built with dual-axis tracking systems are greater on average than their single-axis and fixed-rack counterparts in the same state by 58% and 13%, respectively (Fig. 4a), meaning the former has a larger land footprint than the latter. The same trend persists when evaluated using land use efficiency (Fig. 4b, c). This dichotomy arises because fixed-rack/single-axis PV panel arrays are built in a much more compact formation, taking up less total land than dual-axis panel arrays which require each individual panel to freely and fully track the movement of the sun. On the other hand, individual PV panels on dual-axis mounting systems exhibit greater efficiency in capturing sunlight during the day than their counterparts do.

Land sparing—including siting generation on already-developed surfaces such as rooftops or redeveloped brownfields—can support the potential synergy between technology and ecological health for sustainability energy development29,39,40. Using National Land Cover Data (NLCD) created by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium, we classify the surface cover within each project footprint (Fig. 5a, b) and report both contemporaneous and historical results. In 2019, 59% of projects in our sample are located on land classified as developed (including low, medium, and high intensity), accounting for 65% of total installed capacity. Using NLCD from 2001, when U.S. solar development remained in its infancy, only 1.6% of total installed capacity in our dataset was located on land classified as developed; however, 38% of projects were developed on land that was classified as cultivated crops. Our results confirm previous findings that rural anthromes (e.g., cropland) and biomes (e.g., grassland) that are close to human population are the most likely to have been previously sited for PV projects29,41. This outcome points to the potential for optimizing the dual use of land (e.g, agrivoltaics) to mitigate impacts on local ecological systems while sustaining growth of solar PV. Results indicate that PV projects are being built on various types of land, indicating the need to carefully design dual use systems and consider the sustainability of siting decisions across a variety of local environments. Approximately 14% of existing PV projects in our study area now are located on cultivated cropland, which could be retrofitted into dual use systems to obtain techno-ecological synergies29. An additional 15% of the PV projects utilize rooftop modules, which occupy surfaces within the built environment for solar energy. It can be argued that they do not directly transform additional land, highlighting their potential advantage as a land sparing opportunity. Land sparing opportunities exist but are underrepresented in our sample—PV deployment has in many places driven measurable changes in land cover.

Our systematic methodology enabled the first digital dataset containing project-level land information of solar PV connected to the U.S. Western Interconnection using deep learning. Using this dataset, we contributed a detailed demonstration of land-solar interactions in the region, resulting in novel records of the land use efficiency and land transformation of existing PV facilities with varying geographic and structural characteristics. Our findings confirm that land-solar interactions are highly dependent on local solar output potential and designs of panel mounting systems42,43. We build upon prior studies that apply deep learning to detect and characterize the area of solar PV as the first to characterize the land required by solar PV projects in their entirety as opposed to the solar arrays alone29,33,34,36. In doing so, we provide information on solar land use that is rarely seen in existing data—the entire project site of ground-mounted solar PV projects—and present a more complete picture of land-solar interactions.

A novel observation differentiating our findings from prior research is that facilities with higher performance, dual axis tracking mounting systems, are less efficient in terms of project-level land-use when compared to their fixed/single-axis counterparts. We attribute this finding to the much larger clearing space needed to install individual dual-axis solar arrays (e.g., to avoid inter-panel shading), which thereby reduce the panel density44. These results point to the need for analyses of land-solar interactions to go beyond the array footprint alone to better understand impacts related to the full project area. Additionally, our data enabled an important classification of the land cover occupied by PV installations, presenting an important approach that highlights the benefits of using the built environment to reduce ecosystem impacts45. The majority of the land used for PV projects utilizes land that previously belongs to the rural anthromes and biomes and is now developed, suggesting that solar energy projects are most frequently sited near human population and that land sparing outcomes can be achieved by siting projects to make use of both dual use agrivoltaics and the built environment. Definitive conclusions about the aggregate land-use impacts of solar PV facilities would necessitate ex-ante land cover classification for the same plots of land and potential knock-on effects of local solar energy developments on land use in other areas.

Importantly, our study represents the first attempt to quantify land use metrics using deep learning results, making it the first large-scale analysis of this kind that examines land transformation and land use efficiency. The results demonstrate the potential of using machine learning techniques to perform tasks that are prohibitively difficult and labor intensive (e.g., annotation of PV project site). The combination of GIS and machine learning tools is contributing valuable instruments for consistent collection and analysis of the land-use implications of energy developments. A nascent stream of research has shown the prospects of utilizing open-access map such as the OpenStreetMap to detect and create land-use inventories46,47. Such approaches have the benefit of coverage of large areas but have so far relied on relatively coarse imagery and remain challenged in achieving the high-precision boundary delineation required for intra-facility solar land-use analysis. Crowdsourced data, such as OpenStreetMap, also may be limited in completeness, geographic coverage, and consistency, and has resulted in incomplete solar inventories47. High-resolution aerial imagery such as that we use here more closely represents the ground truth of energy system development, ensuring a replicable approach to producing up-to-date analyses of the rapid development of solar PV. While semantic segmentation for PV detection is increasingly well established, we extend the field by integrating land use efficiency and land transformation metrics21,48.

While this study primarily focuses on quantifying land-solar interactions for PV projects, results have broad implications for data-driven decision-support in fields such as LCA and energy systems planning. LCAs of electricity generation, including solar PV, are increasingly including spatiotemporal inventories49. Site-level data, such as the inventory we produce here, can enable analyses that account for improved geographic representativeness and variability of impacts across projects. While spatial variability is important for solar PV, public inventories have been limited to date11,33,34,36. Future work could further enhance geospatial information by better characterizing transmission lines, access roads and distribution infrastructure50,51.

With rapid growth in solar energy, it is vitally important to improve land management and preserve ecological health while mitigating climate change45. A large-scale map of existing PV projects can inform a better understanding of land-solar interactions, including other social and geographical aspects of existing land-based economies and ecosystems30. Our methods and results contribute important decision-support for planning, policymaking, and analyzing the deployment of PV across states in the Western Interconnection. By publishing an open-access, georeferenced inventory with a carefully documented methodology, we establish a replicable approach to quantifying land-solar interactions, serving as an important benchmark for understanding the land implications of energy transitions with high growth in solar power.

The study area for this research project is the U.S. part of the Western Interconnection which includes the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, Wyoming, and the El Paso County of Texas. We identified potential solar facility locations in our study area and collect annual generation data using the EIA facility data from 2019 (e.g., EIA-860 and EIA-923), which include electricity generating units with installed capacity of at least 1 megawatt. The land area of each solar PV project is determined using a combination of deep learning technology and aerial imagery analysis, the latter of which involved manual annotation to inform the deep learning model. The aerial imagery used in this study comes from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) database administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The NAIP images are acquired at a resolution of <1-meter ground sample distance across the entire US during agricultural growing seasons, representing the more accurate depiction of land-use compared to crowdsourced map databases used in some existing studies47. The image database is updated with a 3-year cycle—the one used in this study is published in 2019. The NLCD is a detailed mapping of the US with consistent and relevant land cover information from 2001 to 2019 with a two-to-three-year interval, created by a group of U.S. agencies named the MRLC. Data for the year 2001 and 2019 are used to better elucidate the change in land cover before and after almost all solar PV installations in our study area are built. The pixel resolution for NLCD is 30 m—suitable for solar PV projects which typically occupy around 200,000 square meters of land and much finer than what has been used in previous findings29.

We compare our estimates against two datasets on the land use of solar PV facilities for the conterminous U.S. published by the USGS in 2016 and jointly by the USGS and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 202330,31. The 2016 USGS dataset identifies locations of solar PV panels in the conterminous US in EIA utility-scale facilities data from 2015 and digitizes the footprint area of each solar array using aerial imagery from NAIP from the same year. In total, they documented that there were 740 U.S. solar PV facilities (1207 arrays) by 2015. Since the scope of our study is limited to the U.S. part of the Western Interconnection, we have a different study area than the two existing datasets.

The solar PV projects examined in our study are distributed across different climate regions with vastly different landscapes. Before deploying a deep learning model for image annotation, which has been shown to be a useful tool for land-use inventory-making and analysis, we need to ensure the performance of the model29,33,34,36,37,47. Our deep learning model needs to be able to capture the distinct features of solar PV systems against the varying backdrops of land cover types. To that end, we begin by training the model using a diverse set of manual annotations. Each solar PV power plant is located using coordinates obtained from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on NAIP. The image of the plant and its immediate surrounding area is then cropped from the aerial imagery and saved for annotation. Specifically, a randomly selected group of 100 projects were manually annotated at first for the development of a deep learning model. The entire portfolio was then automatically annotated by the deep learning model. The product generated by the model then goes through manual post-processing before being compiled into a master shapefile.

Table 1 shows a summary of the six annotation classes we use for solar PV projects. In this solar PV annotation framework, PV panels, inverters, and other infrastructures (e.g., battery storage stations or buildings) are all within the project site. In addition, there will be no overlaps between PV panels and inverters, nor between external access roads and project sites.

In this annotation framework, we only consider (visually distinguishable) external access roads as a separate class, and consider internal roads for operation and maintenance as part of the project site without further classification. In addition, we consider the overall project site as a permanent site clearing and do not distinguish other temporary land use, which usually recovers or is cleared once the project construction is finished, and the project is in operation.

Decision rule on PV panel polygon delineation

The PV panels class can be annotated in multiple ways based on different decision rules on polygon delineation. Here we adopt a “visually distinguishable segments” rule to delineate solar PV panels—separating clusters of PV panels by evidence of relatively larger empty space that can be potentially utilized for other purposes (e.g., dirt road for maintenance vehicles). We decide on this rule in order to separate PV panels from adjacent support infrastructure such as inverters and acknowledge spaces that are reserved for maintenance access, while also categorizing small intervals between PV panels as part of the PV panels class since these parcels of land would not be used for other purposes. For instance, Fig. 6 shows an example of the annotation based on this “visually distinguishable” rule. Here solar PV panels are separated from on-site inverters.

To understand the impacts on PV panel areas using different polygon delineation rules, we compared the land area impacts with four different decision rules. The four rules being tested are based on three delineation methods: 1) the PV panel-only rule, which only accounts for physical PV panels and separates small intervals between panels; 2) the visually distinguishable segments rule, which is the decision rule we adopt as described above; and 3) the quantitative distance rule, which uses a quantitative measure to decide on segmentation, i.e., if panels have a distance larger than the threshold, they are categorized as different polygons, otherwise categorized as a single polygon. For the 3rd method, we use both 10 m and 30 m as decision rules to test, where the 30-m rule is adopted in the previous USGS study. An example of the annotation for the PV panels class based on different decision rules can be found in Fig. 7.

We compare the PV panel land areas for four solar PV projects using these four different decision rules. Potential differences between the decision rules that can be used in this methodology are illustrated in Table 2. Only accounting for PV panels results in about a 50 percent reduction in land footprint compared to using a 30-m rule in these sample projects. However, other than the PV panel-only method, the land area impacts using the other three decision rules are very similar, suggesting minor deviations when switching between these three rules. According to the example shown here, the difference in land area impacts of using different methods would be greater with larger size of projects.

While developing annotated images for solar PV, we also measure two distances in order to justify decision rules for the paper: minimum distance segmented and maximum distance not segmented. An example of the two distances being measured is shown in Fig. 8. The minimum distance segmented represents the minimum distance where two segments of PV panels are separated (due to inverters, roads, or other visually distinguishable features), whereas the maximum distance not segmented represents the maximum distance between PV panels that are aggregated as a single segment.

Development and application of the deep learning model

A deep learning-based network was trained to perform automatic segmentation of the PV panels based on a set of 100 solar PV facilities which is manually annotated according to rules detailed in the section above. We specifically chose U-Net as the deep network for segmentation as it has been seen to work well for segmentation-based applications in aerial imaging where precise boundaries are needed52. U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder takes in the image as input and converts it to a lower dimensional latent space. These features are then forwarded to a decoder which converts the low-dimensional features to the segmentation map. The encoder path resembles a traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, commonly seen in more recent end‑to‑end deep‑learning frameworks for mapping solar arrays33,34,36. It consists of a series of convolutional and pooling layers that progressively reduce the spatial dimensions of the input image while extracting high-level features. Each stage in the encoder path typically consists of two convolutional layers followed by a max pooling operation. The decoder uses a combination of upsampling (transposed convolution) and concatenation operations to recover the spatial information lost during the encoding process. Each stage in the decoder path consists of an upsampling layer followed by two convolutional layers. U-Net incorporates skip connections between corresponding stages of the encoder and decoder paths. These skip connections allow the network to retain low-level details during the upsampling process, enabling precise localization of objects in the segmented output. Repeating such computation process using our training set of 100 annotations enables the model to take in any image and outline different objects within the image (e.g., PV panels). We develop the model by splitting the data into a 70-15-15 split for the train-validation-test. The model is developed using Python for coding, the Pytorch library for training, and a NVIDIA A100 GPU cluster for computation. We use an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 with a batch size of 16. The model is trained for 300 epochs until convergence.

Having developed our deep learning model, we start examining the land-use profile of our entire portfolio of solar PV projects. First, we geo-locate each solar plant in WECC using publicly available information from the EIA and download the corresponding NAIP images using USGS EarthExplorer. In rare cases where the coordinates in EIA surveys do not point to the actual location of the solar PV projects, we try to visually locate said projects using NAIP images or Google Maps. Areas of interest are then determined by creating a buffer area around the perimeter of each plant, with the buffer distance ranging from over 50 meters to include possible land use near the perimeter. The NAIP images within the buffer boundary are split into multiple images, each with a resolution of 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels. Each bundle of images for one plant is then fed into our deep learning model for examination, the outcome of which is merged back into a single shape file delineating the captured land use profile for each plant. Finally, we manually post-process each shape file, correcting any imperfections and collecting data for further land use analysis (Fig. 9).

In the end, our model performs well in terms of identifying image features that resemble empty spacing between PV panels as well as PV panels themselves. However, we do not provide land-use information on ancillary infrastructure in the final results because our model recognizes the various types and shapes of ancillary infrastructure across different landscapes with relatively poorer accuracy than it does panels. To identify any systemic bias in the annotations of panels and project sites, we benchmark our results pre and post manual corrections utilizing the Intersection over Union (IoU) score as our performance metric. Our analysis shows a mean IoU score of 0.822 with high statistical significance (p = 0.0062) and low variance (0.035). The results indicate little difference between the images pre and post manual correction, meaning that there was not much manual correction needed during the post-processing process.

Metrics

The typical nomenclature used in existing literature quantifies land-use efficiency in terms of land area “transformation” and “occupation” metrics. The former is used to evaluate the installation impact of energy systems, while the latter is used to consider the aggregate impact of system installation and operation9,11,26. The inherent difficulty in reporting land-use results under the current nomenclature lies in the lack of standardization in calculations of land area transformation and occupation. Currently, there are dozens of different terms used in existing studies to describe essentially the same two metrics, the majority of which are used both in capacity-based calculations and generation-based calculations with varying timescales19,48. The variation in methods and reporting metrics makes land-use estimations largely incomparable and, in turn, obscures the accurate translation of scientific findings into policy decisions21.

For this study, we proposed the usage of “land transformation” which has been one of the most common metrics used in life cycle assessment literature and other fields11,53,54,55,56. Each project was analyzed by calculating the land area altered per unit of energy produced in the assumed 30-year lifetime using the following equation:

$${Land\; Transformation}\left(\frac{{m}^{2}}{{MWh}}\right)=\frac{{Land\; area\; altered}\,({m}^{2})}{{Life\; time\; electrical\; energy\; production}\,({MWh})}$$

The land area of each project was estimated in terms of the total project footprint and the PV panel footprint. The former refers to all the land within the project site boundaries while the latter refers to the land occupied by the solar arrays. We also differentiate land-use efficiency by calculating capacity-based and generation-based land use efficiency metrics, which are needed to provide a holistic review of the theoretical and real-world land-use efficiency of solar PV facilities14. Importantly, our published data enable users to transparently calculate metrics as appropriate to their analyses48. Each project was analyzed by calculating the land area altered per unit of installed nameplate capacity or annual electricity production in 2019 using the following equations:

$${Capacity}\mbox-{based}\,{Land}\; {Use}\; {Efficiency}\left(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\right)=\frac{{Installed}\; {solar}\; {capacity}\,\left(W\right)}{{Land}\; {area}\; {altered}\,\left({m}^{2}\right)}$$

$${Generation}\mbox-{based}\; {Land}\; {Use}\; {Efficiency}\left(\frac{W}{{m}^{2}}\right)=\frac{{Electrical}\; {energy}\; {production}\; {in}\,2019 \, \left(W\right)}{{Land}\; {area}\; {altered}\,\left({m}^{2}\right)}$$",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02862-5/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2862_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-12-15 06:57:57.508989

To complement the Code, the state government is also progressing targeted regulatory reforms to reinforce its intent and strengthen planning controls for renewable energy projects, including requiring development approval for new noise-sensitive developments near wind farms and a mandatory streamlined approval pathway for projects over $20 million.

Together with the recently released draft Guideline on Community Benefits for Renewable Energy Projects, the proposed changes provide a comprehensive and contemporary approach to planning for renewable energy development in Western Australia.

WA Planning and Lands Minister John Carey said: “The release of the draft Renewable Energy Planning Code and supporting Guidelines for public comment is a significant step in ensuring Western Australia has a clear and consistent policy framework that supports investment in renewable energy projects that will be critical to our future economy.”

“The draft Code provides a transparent and contemporary planning framework that gives certainty to industry, while ensuring communities have clarity about how potential impacts will be assessed and managed.”

“A strong and streamlined approvals pathway is essential to giving proponents confidence to progress major clean energy projects that support jobs and drive regional development.”

“I encourage Western Australians to review the draft Code and Guidelines and share their feedback during the consultation period.”

Public consultation on the draft Code and Guidelines will run until 10 April 2026. Submissions can be made online or by mail.

“India stands at a decisive moment in strengthening its solar manufacturing ecosystem,” said Chetan Shah, Chairman and Managing Director at Solex Energy.
“While our module capacity has grown significantly, the ground realities of domestic cell manufacturing are often misunderstood.
In his view, solar cells remain the backbone of upstream integration, ALMM compliance, and India’s domestic manufacturing ambitions.
Rustagi noted that solar manufacturing is extremely capital-intensive, and globally, the large, vertically integrated players are best positioned to survive and grow over time.","The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy’s (MNRE) recent advisory to banks and financial institutions, calling for prudence in lending to standalone solar module manufacturing, has been welcomed by the renewable energy sector. Stakeholders say capital should flow into parts of the renewable energy ecosystem that have remained underdeveloped.

In an office memorandum, MNRE urged the Department of Financial Services to ensure that financing decisions “adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach” when lending to module manufacturing amid overcapacity.

India’s module manufacturing capacity, now nearing 150 GW, is already 200–250% higher than domestic demand and could cross 200 GW in the coming years.

However, upstream segments such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and key ancillaries such as solar glass and aluminium frames, have not kept pace with module manufacturing growth.

Module capacity enlisted under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers List (ALMM) as of November 2025 was 121.72 GW, while the cell capacity registered under the ALMM List-II stood at 18.48 GW.

Industry insiders say the MNRE advisory is timely.

Dushyant Kumar, PV Quality Manager at AXITEC Energy India, said, “Overcapacity is pressuring prices and lowering utilization, and continued financing of standalone module plants could create avoidable debt risks. The priority now should be integrated manufacturing and upstream segments, such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, and key ancillaries, such as glass and frames. These are the real gaps holding back India’s solar supply chain.”

Unsustainable Buildup

The trigger for MNRE’s action was a letter from the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), which warned that installed and upcoming module capacities already exceed near-term domestic demand and that unchecked lending to more module and cell lines risks unsustainable debt buildup and potential non-performing assets.

“If fresh lending keeps flowing indiscriminately into new module lines, we risk pushing the industry towards distress and bankruptcies,” says Praveen Kumar, Director General at AISIA. “The intent was never to say ‘stop lending’ to the solar sector, but rather to urge lenders to be cautious about further expanding module capacity in an already saturated segment.”

He stressed that the Association also wanted to draw attention to the parts of the value chain where capital is still welcome: “Capacity in upstream manufacturing is still lagging behind potential demand, and where lending opportunities remain strong. MNRE’s subsequent clarification through its press release should put these doubts to rest and give banks and NBFCs the confidence to keep supporting viable, well-structured projects across the solar ecosystem.”

AISIA essentially told the government and the banking system that the sector is at risk of building factories that will be stranded if utilization stays low and prices remain under pressure.

Horizontal Growth

For years, government incentives, from production-linked incentives to customs duties and domestic content rules, spurred a proliferation of module assembly lines and, later, cell manufacturing lines. These were faster, cheaper, and less technologically intensive to set up than upstream facilities, making them the natural entry point for new players.

“India stands at a decisive moment in strengthening its solar manufacturing ecosystem,” said Chetan Shah, Chairman and Managing Director at Solex Energy. “While our module capacity has grown significantly, the ground realities of domestic cell manufacturing are often misunderstood. A major portion of India’s cell capacity is still based on older P-type technologies that require urgent upgradation, and only a limited share is truly future-ready N-type capacity.”

Shah warned that if lenders apply a blunt caution that doesn’t distinguish between modules and cells, they could inadvertently hurt a critical bridge segment. In his view, solar cells remain the backbone of upstream integration, ALMM compliance, and India’s domestic manufacturing ambitions. Restricting or delaying financing for genuinely competitive, technology-upgrading cell projects, he argued, would risk slowing the transition to advanced technologies such as TOPCon and beyond, precisely where India needs to move next.

The contrast with the upstream side is stark. While module capacity has raced ahead, cell capacity appears on track to meet demand in the near future, India still has only about 2 GW of ingot and wafer capacity and no commercial-scale polysilicon production. Solar glass and aluminum frames, crucial ancillaries for any serious module ecosystem, are also flagged by MNRE as segments where domestic capacity lags demand, with glass around 15 GW and aluminum frames around 17 GW per year.

Some stakeholders introduced a caveat. While agreeing that module overcapacity is real, they cautioned against overreacting. “While banks may exercise caution in the short term, growing demand for solar panels will require a substantial increase in solar capacity,” noted Avinash Hiranandani, Vice Chairman and Managing Director at RenewSys.

He argued that continued banking support for solar manufacturing, including modules, will remain crucial as India’s deployment targets ramp up, especially since “solar cell production has not yet caught up with rising module demand” and a broader ecosystem of ancillaries, such as encapsulants, also needs timely funding to scale.

The sector’s problem is not that too much capital has flowed into solar, but that it has flowed disproportionately into one layer of the stack.

The Road Ahead

The MNRE advisory to banks must also be seen in the context of India’s position within global supply chains. For long, the Indian industry has relied on the Chinese upstream supply. However, the actual build-out has left India with a large fleet of module lines and some cell lines that are still dependent on imported wafers and polysilicon.

Vinay Rustagi, Chief Business Officer at Premier Energies, pointed out that the real gap lies in ingots, wafers, polysilicon, silicon refining, and critical minerals and chemicals. “If we want true self-sufficiency and not just final assembly in India, then capital has to flow into these areas.”

The advisory, he said, was “a nudge for the financial system to align with the country’s long-term manufacturing and energy security goals, rather than adding more capacity where we are already relatively comfortable.”

Another layer to the rationale lies in the need to correct distortions created during the ALMM-heavy years. ALMM pushed developers to buy from domestic, listed manufacturers, which in turn incentivized many firms to quickly add or expand module lines to make it onto the list.

MNRE’s advisory signals that the next phase of growth should address structural gaps in the value chain.

Not everyone, however, is at ease with the implied consolidation. Smaller module manufacturers fear that prioritizing upstream could make it harder for them to raise funds.

Rustagi noted that solar manufacturing is extremely capital-intensive, and globally, the large, vertically integrated players are best positioned to survive and grow over time. “Smaller companies with limited, non-integrated capacities were always going to find it difficult to compete and to raise money at scale, regardless of this lending guidance.”

In that sense, the MNRE rethink on lending to module manufacturing is less a sudden change in direction and more a formal recognition of where market forces were already pushing the industry. If upstream capabilities, especially in ingots and wafers, are strengthened in time ahead of tighter ALMM timelines around 2028, that shift could ultimately support a more resilient, integrated domestic ecosystem that benefits the entire solar value chain.

Industry voices converge on one central point: prudence does not mean paralysis. A calibrated lending approach, as Shah and others argue, would distinguish between speculative, announcement-driven projects and genuinely competitive, technology-upgrading investments, especially in cells and upstream manufacturing. Hiranandani’s emphasis on long-term demand and ancillaries, Rustagi’s call for upstream depth, and AISIA’s focus on system-wide stability all point in the same direction: rebalance capital, don’t retreat from the sector.

“I’m generally not in favor of steering lenders or directing lending toward one segment over another. There’s already too much thumb on the scale in this sector,” commented Raj Prabhu, CEO at Mercom Capital Group.

“Sophisticated lenders are expected to conduct proper due diligence and price the risk of each segment based on fundamentals and demand-supply realities. The market rewards good underwriting with attractive returns and will punish poor decisions with bad loans.

If investment decisions are routinely ‘guided’ from the top or shaped by factions with their own interests, you end up with misallocation and poor outcomes. Government should focus on providing clear policy direction, long-term demand visibility, and targeted incentives to accelerate innovation towards building critical domestic supply chains,” added Prabhu.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-11-26T181504.817.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 02:00:33.852707

According to project documents seen by this newspaper, the exploration activities are expected to be conducted over a three-year period, commencing January 1, 2026 to 2028. The seismic works are earmarked for three sites, measuring a total of 25,604.78 square kilometers or almost the size of the Stabroek Block, operated by ExxonMobil.

Seismic surveys are routinely used in offshore oil and gas exploration activities worldwide to detect and define geological structures under the seabed.

An application for the initial oil exploration works was made by CGG, an affiliate company of the Viridien group. Viridien is a global advanced technology, digital and Earth data company that provides a comprehensive range of data, products, services and solutions for complex digital, energy transition, natural resource, environmental and infrastructure challenges. In addition to proprietary offshore projects for clients such as Exxon, which discovered the successful Liza field from CGG data, CGG acquired the only two offshore multi-client projects available for licensing in Guyana (Stabroek Phase 1 & 2).

Regionally, CGG recently completed a multi-client project in Suriname in 2023. Covering 1,800 sq km, Phase IV completed the programmed 14,500 sq km survey of newly acquired 3D data in deep and shallow water in the Guyana-Suriname basin.

On 11 November 2025, CGG applied for an Environmental Authorisation to the EPA, seeking to conduct geophysical 3D surveys within shallow waters offshore of Guyana. The areas for the shallow water survey are outlined on a map attached.

The survey area is offshore of Guyana, east of the border of Venezuela and west of the border of Suriname. The closest shore distance is around 120 km away and ranges with water depths approximately 10 to 70 metres deep.

According to the Project Summary, a research vessel with a towed streamer will be used for the seismic acquisition. Towed streamer 3D seismic acquisition allows for the efficient and comprehensive mapping of offshore geological formations, providing valuable insights for oil and gas exploration and production activities.

“This is a common method used to gather detailed subsurface geological information in offshore exploration for oil and gas. CGG currently plans to use the BGP Prospector for this project.”

The company noted that the vessel is fully furnished with state-of-the-art equipment for seismic 3D surveys.

Kaieteur News understands that the activities will be conducted in a total of eight phases beginning with setup and deployment, data acquisition and closing with data processing and interpretation.

Impacts associated with the planned development includes marine noise, marine water quality and climate, fishing and marine traffic disruptions among others.

Marine seismic data acquisition is based on the principle of ‘seismic reflection’. The method involves releasing pulses of acoustic energy (i.e., sound waves) at regular intervals along designated transect lines. In general, the energy penetrates subsurface formations and is reflected back to the surface where it can be detected by acoustic receivers, or hydrophones, encased in a long cable (i.e., streamer), which is towed behind the seismic vessel. Each time a seismic pulse meets a change in rock properties; part of the pulse is reflected back to the surface and received by the hydrophones. Consequently, by measuring precisely the difference in arrival time of reflected seismic energy, distinct subsurface rock layers can be identified, and subsequently mapped. This map helps geoscientists understand the geology and structure of natural resources. It plays an integral role in decision making when exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves in ocean waters.

No EIA

The EPA in a decision published on its website explained that the developer will not be required to conduct an EIA for the three-year seismic activities. The regulator listed three reasons for its decision but indicated that the project has not yet been approved.

The Agency said, “The impacts are transient. The acoustic disturbance moves continuously with the vessel and does not result in permanent habitat alteration or permanent presence.”

Additionally, it noted that “potential biological and socio-economic disruptions are reversible immediately upon cessation of the activity; (meanwhile) impacts related to vessel operation, routine discharges, and resource consumption are standard for offshore activities and are adequately mitigated by compliance with international conventions (e.g., MARPOL) and the proposed EMP.”

Monash Science 2025: Breakthroughs shaping a cleaner, safer and smarter future

2025 has been a defining year for Monash Science a year where curiosity ignited innovation, and ideas turned into national and global impact.

From rewriting humanity’s cosmic origin story to engineering virus cocktails that combat superbugs, Monash scientists are advancing solutions to some of the world’s most urgent challenges.

We’ve launched a new Climate Change Science Hub, welcomed a Sustainable Development Education team into the Faculty, and celebrated record-breaking success across Australia’s most competitive research funding schemes.

Our students have even reached for the stratosphere, literally, sending a telescope balloon skyward to explore the Sun.

At Monash Science, we don’t just observe the future, we build it.

Commenting on the year’s achievements Monash Science Deputy Dean Research Professor Katya Pas said:

“Our researchers are addressing the world’s most urgent challenges with imagination, precision, and fearlessness.

“Innovation isn’t just a metric here, it’s our mindset.”

Transforming the planet’s future

Breakthrough hydrogen technologies

Green hydrogen is a cornerstone of a decarbonised future but to deliver it at scale, we must dramatically reduce the cost of production. In a major advancement, Monash science researchers uncovered the fundamental science that could unlock cheaper, more efficient methods for hydrogen generation using abundant materials. This research lays vital groundwork for the clean energy revolution that will fuel industries and economies of tomorrow.

Seaweed secrets rewriting climate models

Kelp forests and marine algae are some of the planet’s most powerful and underestimated climate engineers. Monash scientists revealed the unseen chemical and biological processes shaping how seaweed interacts with the Earth system. Their findings could significantly improve the accuracy of global climate models and guide more effective ocean-based climate solutions.

Caution in ‘green’ fertilisers

As industries push for cleaner agriculture, new ‘green’ fertiliser technologies have surged to market but not all claims stack up. Monash chemists are leading global calls for rigorous testing to prevent unintended environmental harm from poorly understood nitrogen-conversion technologies. Their work ensures climate progress doesn’t come at the cost of soil, waterways or biodiversity.

Packaging and catalysis innovation leading national ARC success

From next-generation catalysts that reduce industrial emissions to packaging that is smarter, stronger and more circular, Monash Science researchers secured national leadership in the ARC Linkage funding round. These projects represent breakthrough solutions that will help industries transition to more sustainable manufacturing systems while preserving global food security.

Protecting health and life

Virus cocktails vs superbugs

Antibiotic resistance is escalating into one of humanity’s most dangerous health threats. Monash scientists developed a virus phage cocktail capable of targeting drug-resistant bacteria. This precision approach could deliver a lifeline in cases where antibiotics fail, marking a major leap toward the clinic.

New genetic code advances mRNA medicine

Behind every breakthrough therapy lies the molecular machinery that powers it. Researchers at Monash have identified a previously unknown layer of genetic coding that steers mRNA behaviour. With this discovery, the future of personalised medicine, including targeted treatments for cancer and rare disease, is one giant step closer.

Snakes striking faster than thought possible

How do venomous snakes launch deadly strikes faster than the human eye can track? Using high-speed imaging systems, Monash biologists captured the physics of these lightning-fast movements, insights that could improve antivenom design and inform emergency response strategies in regions where snakebite remains fatal.:

Understanding our planet above and below

Predicting the next megaquake

Deep beneath our feet, massive tectonic forces are at play and Monash geoscientists are decoding them. New modelling reveals where the next catastrophic earthquake could erupt across Southeast Asia, equipping governments and communities with critical foresight to reduce risk and improve resilience.

Students chasing sunlight at the edge of space

What happens when Monash Science students look to the sky? They build a solar telescope and send it into the stratosphere. This student-led mission is more than an experiment — it’s a launchpad for Australia’s next generation of space scientists and engineers.

Rewriting the laws of nature

Quantum particles act like social creatures

Defying expectations, Monash physicists discovered that photons can interact like cooperative agents rather than isolated particles. This behaviour — observed in cutting-edge quantum systems — could usher in more stable and powerful quantum computing architectures.

Binary stars everywhere

Our astronomers helped reveal that binary star systems — pairs of stars bound in orbit — are far more common than previously believed. This breakthrough reshapes how we understand stellar evolution and the origins of planets like our own.

Influencing the Nobel landscape

Monash crystallography research stood behind one of the world’s most prestigious recognitions — contributing to the discoveries honoured in the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. It’s a powerful reminder that foundational science shapes global triumphs.

Celebrating research excellence

A powerhouse year of Australian Research Council success strengthened Monash’s position as a national leader in discovery:

$11M+ in ARC Discovery funding for transformative research that expands human knowledge

DECRA funding nearly tripled, supporting five emerging stars as they tackle frontier science

Five ARC Future Fellows — with women leading the way in scientific leadership

Monash mathematician named Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, joining the global elite in mathematical research

Together, these achievements reflect a research culture defined by ambition, excellence and impact.

Accelerating climate solutions

This year, we launched the Climate Change Science Hub, a new interdisciplinary engine room accelerating climate research across ecosystems, oceans, policy, and planetary systems science. It cements Monash as a major contributor to solving the world’s defining environmental challenge.

We also welcomed a new Sustainable Development Education team, strengthening our capacity to equip future leaders with the scientific and systems expertise needed for a decarbonised and resilient world.",https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/image/0005/4189901/katya-pas_690x435.jpeg,N,,2025-12-15 02:00:38.308320

What, then, should GM workers do to oppose the impending layoffs?","Autoworkers: Take up the fight against layoffs! Fill out the form at the end of this article to speak out against layoffs and learn more about joining the Autoworkers Rank-and-File Committee.

Unless it is halted by collective action by workers themselves, the coming week could be the last for 1,145 workers at the General Motors Factory Zero assembly plant in Detroit. The automaker plans to slash production to a single shift beginning January 5, 2026. The permanent layoffs are being imposed on the eve of the holiday shutdown, which runs from December 24 through January 4, leaving workers to face unemployment and the loss of healthcare during the most financially precarious time of the year.

The job cuts follow a brutal year in which Factory Zero workers were subjected to extreme levels of overtime, routinely working between 72 and 80 hours a week for much of 2024. These conditions were followed by irregular temporary layoffs, creating a cycle of exhaustion and insecurity. Both shifts were placed on temporary layoff until November 24, 2025, before GM announced the move to permanently eliminate more than 1,000 jobs.

The United Auto Workers bureaucracy has not even made a pretense of opposing the mass layoffs, which will only deepen the social crisis in the city which houses the headquarters of both GM and the UAW. The official poverty rate in the Motor City is already 35 percent, with 51 percent of children living in poverty, according to the census report.

In the statement “Mobilize to stop GM layoffs at Factory Zero in Detroit—Build rank-and-file committees,” the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC) has called on workers to form independent committees capable of organizing a real fight, unifying workers across plants and borders and breaking out of the isolation imposed by the union bureaucracy. Only the mass, collective action by workers can stop the layoffs and fight for the right to secure, good-paying jobs for all.

The layoffs are not the result of any financial losses for GM. In October, the company raised its projected 2025 net profits to between $12 billion and $13 billion, up from a prior estimate of $10 billion to $12.5 billion. This followed record profits of $14.9 billion in 2024. GM stock has risen approximately 55 percent over the past year.

According to an investor note published December 12 on the financial website Trevis, “In the last decade, General Motors (GM) stock has returned $45 [billion] back to its shareholders through cold, hard cash via dividends and buybacks.” This represents 58.4 percent of GM’s current market capitalization—more than double the median payout ratio for companies listed on the S&P 500.

GM is also indefinitely laying off 550 workers at the Lordstown, Ohio Ultium Cells battery plant. An additional 850 workers there will be placed on temporary layoff effective January 5. And 710 workers will be temporarily laid off at the Spring Hill, Tennessee Ultium Cells battery plant beginning the same day.

Hundreds of workers at the nearby Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, also remain on layoff, with company executives considering whether to scrap the F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck altogether.

This is part of a global jobs massacre in the auto industry. VW, Bosch, ZF and other German auto and auto parts companies have announced 50,000 job cuts in the first 10 months of 2025 alone.

Together, these cuts expose the fraudulent character of the claims by the automakers and the UAW that the electric vehicle transition would bring stable, high-quality jobs.

A young worker who was laid off from Factory Zero several months ago told the World Socialist Web Site that he had heard through the “rumor mill” that the GM Lake Orion plant—which has been closed for retooling for two years—could ramp up or resume production in the third quarter of 2026. The facility is currently being reconverted back to internal combustion engine production, after earlier being tooled for electric vehicles at enormous cost.

“When I was at Factory Zero, I think I was, for the first year, working 12-hour shifts,” he said. After being laid off for at least the second time in just a few years at GM, “I lost my healthcare. The Affordable Care Act subsidy is probably not going to be continuing next year, so it will be really tough for some of us.”

He described the complete lack of information from the United Auto Workers. “One of my buddies was like, ‘don’t really expect much from the local.’ I don’t think any of the people involved in working in the union actually know what’s going on … there’s just a lot of uncertainty.”

Contrasting the company’s soaring profits with the conditions facing workers, he said, “The stock price of the company keeps going up and up.” He noted that GM and other automakers had received massive tax cuts. “I thought the whole point of trickle down was for the money to trickle down. Stock prices are going up, and it’s not trickling down.”

He added that there had to be a way to “tax people that are getting rich off of stock buybacks” and said younger workers were increasingly alienated from both corporate-backed parties. “My generation, we are just tired; and we’ve only been doing the adult thing for a few years now. There has not been a single good president in my lifetime … we’re looking for an alternative.”

Anger over the union’s complicity is widespread. A veteran worker at the Stellantis Toledo Assembly Plant told the WSWS, “The union just doesn’t back the people. We had this ‘Stand Up’ strike [in 2023], and Jeep was one of the few plants that were called out. That was stupid. We should all have been out at the same time.

“The union gives in to the company so much. There’s never a 40-hour week. It’s like my life is Jeep. You can’t plan anything for your family. We’ve got more than 1,000 guys on layoff, and they don’t want to go back to three shifts. That’s why we’re working all these hours, and guys are getting hurt.

“When I first hired in there in the late 1990s the union was still strong. But, man, how things have changed.” He voted against the 2009 concessions, explaining, “I wasn’t going to give up anything.

“I pay $100 to the UAW every month,” he said. “I don’t call it union dues anymore. I call it medical insurance. That’s the way you have to look at it, because it’s gotten so bad, and it’s just going to get worse.”

He pointed to the vast VEBA (Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association) retiree healthcare trust as a source of corruption. “There’s enough in there to take care of great, great grandchildren.” He said second-tier workers, who do not get pensions and retiree healthcare, constitute more than half the workers at Stellantis. “When we workers with pensions die off, the UAW and the company are going to dip into that money for themselves. You follow the money, and you’re going to see the corruption. It’s billions and billions, and it’s going up every month.”

On the rank-and-file campaign of Will Lehman for UAW president in 2022, he said simply, “It was great, great, great. I voted for him because he was rank and file and was trying to get the people on the shop floors together. It’s hard but that’s what we have to do.”

The worker also expressed anger over Trump’s witch-hunting of immigrant workers and war threats against Venezuela. “I’m against them blowing up fishing boats and killing people. They don’t even know what cargo they had.”

Hundreds of thousands of workers have viewed WSWS videos featuring Factory Zero workers, reflecting the depth of opposition. Online comments echo the same concerns. One worker wrote on Reddit, “GM is going to transfer the laid off workers to St. Louis or Texas and 90% will decline, resulting in being fired and disqualified from unemployment.”

Another asked, “Should we just call jobs in the automotive industry temp jobs from now on?”

Responding to a discussion of the UAW’s role, one worker explained, “Because the UAW and Shawn Fain supported Trump, and the reason this plant is closing is because Trump removed the EV tax credit essentially killing demand for EVs … and the UAW didn’t do anything to fight against those policies.”

The layoffs at Factory Zero are the predictable outcome of capitalist restructuring driven by investor demands, automation and profit maximization. Under capitalism, workers’ livelihoods are subordinated entirely to Wall Street.

The role of the UAW apparatus has been to facilitate this process. By refusing to mobilize the membership and by backing nationalist policies that divide workers by country and plant, the bureaucracy has functioned as an arm of corporate management.

What, then, should GM workers do to oppose the impending layoffs?

Asked this question Socialism AI, the new chatbox launched by the World Socialist Web Site, emphasized that workers cannot rely on appeals to management or the union leadership. The defense of jobs requires independent, democratic organization on the shop floor.

Rank-and-file committees, formed by trusted workers in every department and shift, must take control of the struggle, demand an immediate halt to layoffs, and fight for full pay and benefits for all affected workers.

Such committees would unify workers across plants and industries, prepare collective action—including strikes and mass protests—and link Factory Zero workers with autoworkers nationally and internationally through the International Workers Alliance of Rank-and-File Committees (IWA-RFC). Only by breaking from the nationalism promoted by the UAW apparatus and advancing an internationalist perspective can workers counter the global auto industry’s restructuring strategy.

The fight to defend jobs at Factory Zero raises fundamental political questions. It is not simply a dispute with one company but a confrontation with the capitalist system itself that sacrifices workers’ lives and livelihoods for private profit. The transformation of the auto industry—automation, EV production and technological change—must be placed under democratic workers’ control and reorganized to meet social needs, not the further enrichment of wealthy shareholders.

The impending layoffs at Factory Zero are a warning. They demonstrate that without independent organization and collective action workers will continue to pay the price for the capitalist crisis. The growing anger among autoworkers points to the possibility of a broader movement—one that links the defense of jobs to the fight for political independence of the working class and the reorganization of society on socialist foundations.

Windmills and solar panels make only a small contribution to grid reliability in cold snaps, according to Olson.
The demand for electricity will grow, but the supply will shrink, according to figures compiled by E3.
“We need resources that can provide that energy for extended periods during these cold weather events,” Olson said.
Electric utilities have plans to build enough new power resources to make the grid reliable.","If the Northwest has a long cold snap, it may not have enough electricity, a consultant hired by utilities said.

Up to now, the region has had enough power to meet extraordinary demand. But the surplus is expected to turn into a deficit in 2026, E3 senior partner Arne Olson told the Washington Senate Environment, Energy and Technology Committee on Dec. 5.

Power plants that provide “firm” electricity, such as coal plants, are being shut down. Almost all new power plants are intermittent wind and solar installations, he said.

Windmills and solar panels make only a small contribution to grid reliability in cold snaps, according to Olson. Batteries typically supply power for only four hours, he said.

“If you have an event that lasts three or four days, the four hours is really not that helpful,” Olson said.

Two-part study

Public and investor-owned utilities in Washington and Oregon hired San Francisco-based E3 (stands for Energy and Environmental Economics) to do a two-part study.

The first part evaluated the grid’s reliability. The second part, still to come, will suggest ways to make the grid more reliable.

E3 projects the grid will become increasingly short of enough power to meet peak demands. The demand for electricity will grow, but the supply will shrink, according to figures compiled by E3.

“When I read this report, I had a hard time sleeping,” said the committee’s chairwoman, Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham.

Hydropower dams are a defense against power outages.

“If it’s a wet year, we are fine. If it’s a very, very dry year, and we have a cold snap, that’s when we have the biggest problems,” Olson said.

Demand accelerating

Data centers, electric vehicles and manufacturing are expected to accelerate demand.

Meanwhile, Washington’s clean-energy law commands electric utilities to get off fossil fuels by 2045. The state’s last coal plant is scheduled to close at the end of this year.

Wind, solar and batteries make up almost all new resources. As a result, the region will have less electricity available to meet peak demands. E3 projects the shortfall will grow to 8,600 megawatts by 2030.

“We need resources that can provide that energy for extended periods during these cold weather events,” Olson said.

“We’re replacing resources, but we’re not replacing them in-kind,” he said. “We are actually losing capacity, rather than gaining it over the last seven years.

“In the future, we’ll be looking at emerging technologies, such as geothermal or nuclear or long-duration storage that also may be able to help, but those aren’t available today,” Olson said.

Electric utilities have plans to build enough new power resources to make the grid reliable. But to keep up, they will have to pick up the pace, and it’s hard to get anything build, Olson said.

“More than has been built in the last 25 years has to be built in the next five years,” Olson said. “It’s very challenging to think we can get this amount of power developed over the next five years.”",https://chinookobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/BPA-lines.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-12-14 23:57:44.895393

The move comes as a litany of energy-rich nations aim to decarbonize the fuel production market in their nations to provide cleaner energy resources for the downstream market.

Repsol plans to enable its Tarragona Ecoplanta to deliver vast amounts of fuels that will boost the downstream market

The company has noted that it plans to invest up to €800 million in the Tarragona Ecoplanta, which will be capable of producing vast amounts of methanol and renewable gasoline and diesel through the conversion of urban waste into energy resources. The project will be the first of its kind in Europe, and exemplifies the need to produce cleaner fuels for the industrial, shipping, and transport industries.

The project will boost the regional clean fuel operations as Spain, along with the rest of the world, aims to decarbonize the fuel market to meet stringent clean energy and emission targets by the end of the decade. Repsol has noted that the project will create up to 2,800 jobs during the construction phase, and will provide a further 340 jobs once the pioneering plant begins operations.

“Ecoplanta will strongly contribute to achieving the ambitious waste management objectives for the 2030-2035 horizon. Together with the improvement of selective collection, anaerobic digestion, and mechanical and chemical recycling, it will make it possible to achieve the recycling objectives and minimize the disposal of waste in landfills and incineration, as well as the improvements that this reduction in the use of landfills represents for the environment.” – Repsol statement on the Tarragona Ecoplanta

The project has received funds from the Innovation Fund of the European Union

Notably, the Tarragona Ecoplanta conversion of urban waste into methanol, renewable diesel, and gasoline will leverage Repsol’s already impressive infrastructure in the region. Repsol’s board of directors recently gave its approval for the project to move forward after it was selected by the Innovation Fund of the European Union due to its ability to drastically reduce emissions from methanol and renewable diesel production.

Reducing emissions in the transport sector has become a top priority for the international market, and Repsol’s pioneering Ecoplanta in Tarragona, Catalonia, will need an astonishing €800 million to begin operations, which Repsol is aiming for by 2029 at the very latest. Repsol’s plant will be able to process up to 400,000 tons of municipal solid waste annually, which it will then convert into 240,000 tons of renewable fuels such as diesel and gasoline.

The announcement of the project comes as the European Commission has recently unveiled a new plan to reinforce the EU’s chemical sector, paving the way for significant change in the regional energy market.

Repsol is aiming to become the market leader in clean and renewable fuel production

Repsol’s pioneering €800 million investment in the Tarragona Ecoplanta will completely reshape the downstream market as the world aims to diversify fuel production and reduce emissions from the transport sector overall. With Spain aiming to foster investments in hydrogen as a fuel source, the sentiment for clean fuel production in the nation has become all too clear. Repsol’s already impressive portfolio has positioned the company as a market leader that is not afraid to shake things up in the downstream sector, and add to that the pioneering Tarragona Ecoplanta project, and the future of clean fuel production in Spain is looking good.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/49.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 23:57:47.849652

The clean energy industry is experiencing a significant transformation, fueled by increased capital flow, evolving regulations, and the development of advanced trading platforms. With global electricity consumption expected to rise by 4.5% in 2025, the demand for robust, transparent systems to facilitate energy transactions is more pressing than ever. Leading this shift is REsurety's CleanTrade, a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) recognized by the CFTC, which has quickly established itself as a key player in clean energy market liquidity. This article explores how investments in regulated clean energy marketplaces are creating new possibilities for institutional investors, ESG-focused funds, and corporate energy purchasers.

Liquidity in Clean Energy: Financing Growth in a Dynamic Market

In 2025, the clean energy lending sector saw remarkable expansion, with project finance debt increasing by 7.6% in the first half of the year compared to 2024. This surge is attributed to several factors: accelerating electrification, strong investor appetite for ESG-compliant assets, and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). For example, large-scale solar and wind projects with full contracts now obtain construction loans at spreads of just 150 basis points over SOFR, a significant improvement over the 300–1,000 basis points required for newer technologies or less established sponsors.

The real driver of liquidity, however, is the emergence of virtual power purchase agreement (VPPA) trading platforms. Since its launch in September 2025, REsurety's CleanTrade has exemplified this trend. Within just two months, the platform facilitated $16 billion in notional value ready for trading, streamlining the process for energy derivatives and enabling institutional investors to manage price risk while supporting ESG objectives. CleanTrade’s transparent, regulated marketplace for financially settled clean energy contracts fills a crucial gap in market infrastructure, reducing counterparty risk and improving overall efficiency.

Regulatory Shifts: Challenges and New Pathways

The regulatory landscape for clean energy is becoming more intricate. The U.S. CFTC’s approval of CleanTrade has set a new benchmark for compliance and transparency in VPPA trading. Yet, recent amendments to the IRA—specifically through the Budget Reconciliation Bill—have introduced fresh hurdles. These changes have modified tax credit qualifications and imposed Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions starting in 2026, leading to a 4% average increase in the cost of U.S. wind and solar PPAs. As a result, developers and buyers are prioritizing projects with earlier completion dates to maximize IRA benefits.

At the same time, international regulators are tightening rules around renewable energy claims. For instance, updated European standards now exclude certain countries from renewable energy eligibility, complicating cross-border PPA arrangements. These developments highlight the need for flexible contract structures, with VPPA buyers increasingly adding clauses to comply with evolving frameworks such as the GHG Protocol and the RE100 initiative.

Strategic Considerations for Investors and Corporations

For institutional investors and ESG fund managers, platforms like CleanTrade open new channels for deploying capital. By standardizing VPPA derivatives, CleanTrade simplifies project financing and allows investors to diversify across different regions and technologies. This is particularly important as global investment in clean energy reached $2.2 trillion in 2025, with solar and wind leading new capacity additions.

Corporations are also leveraging VPPA platforms to manage price fluctuations. Settlement Swap Agreements (SSAs), which transfer wholesale power price risk to third parties while preserving the environmental benefits of renewable energy certificates (RECs), are gaining popularity. For companies committed to net-zero targets, SSAs provide financial predictability without sacrificing sustainability—a crucial advantage as regulatory and market standards become more stringent.

Looking Ahead: Building the Future of Clean Energy

The intersection of regulatory certainty, technological progress, and strong investor interest is reshaping the clean energy sector. REsurety's CleanTrade is more than just a trading platform—it is a foundational infrastructure that addresses the sector’s needs for liquidity, transparency, and risk management. As electricity demand continues to climb and regulatory frameworks evolve, investing in well-governed marketplaces will be vital to unlocking the full potential of clean energy. For institutional investors, ESG managers, and corporate buyers, the path forward is clear: the future of clean energy depends on platforms that seamlessly integrate financial performance with environmental responsibility.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-15 00:58:47.758997

On former rice fields in the country’s southwest, a hulking, X-shaped building is being built with equal urgency under great secrecy. That facility’s existence wasn’t widely known until researchers spotted it in satellite images a year or so ago.

Together, the colossal projects are China’s most ambitious efforts yet to harness an energy source that could transform civilization: fusion.

Fusion, the melding together of atoms to release extraordinary energy, uses fuels that are plentiful, carries no risk of meltdowns and leaves no long-lived radioactive waste. It promises near-limitless energy that might not only satisfy the surging demand for electricity to power artificial intelligence but also end reliance on the fossil fuels that are perilously overheating the planet.

Scientists first mused a century ago about fusion, the energy of the stars. In recent decades, they have made major strides toward reproducing the process in the laboratory using magnets and lasers. Yet forcing unruly atoms to combine is vastly more difficult than splitting them, as in the fission process that produces nuclear power today.

A fusion reactor must first heat hydrogen to temperatures hotter than the sun, turning it into plasma, the fourth state of matter. Then it needs to hold this violent plasma together for long enough that the atoms fuse and disgorge energy. China, the United States and other countries are now racing to develop the machines that can pull all this off and survive to do it again and again, reliably enough to power a grid.

The world’s two superpowers are in a tightening contest to dominate the energy future. Under the Trump administration, the U.S. is intent on producing oil, gas and coal and selling it abroad. Its chief economic rival, China, has become the world’s dominant supplier of clean energy in the form of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles.

Fusion could change the calculus for both nations and the globe. Whoever conquers it could build plants around the world and forge new alliances with energy-hungry countries. But the Americans and the Chinese have very different strategies for getting there.

The United States is counting on private industry and American innovation to deliver results, with government agencies providing targeted support. From coast to coast, a fleet of start-ups has brought new urgency and ingenuity to the quest.

On the other side of the world, China’s government has made fusion a national priority, marshaling resources at daunting speed. Recently, a Shanghai start-up essentially matched an engineering breakthrough by America’s best-funded fusion company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in much less time. Over the summer, the Chinese government and private investors poured $2.1 billion into a new state-owned fusion company. That investment alone is two and a half times the U.S. Energy Department’s annual fusion budget.

The two countries’ progress could soon be tested head-to-head.

Commonwealth says that by 2027, the experimental device it is building in Massachusetts will pull off a key feat: producing more energy than it takes to run. That would be a signal that fusion could someday generate electricity for data centers, steel mills and more.

China’s leading plasma-physics lab is aiming for its new machine, which has the modest name of BEST and will sit in the twin-armed building in the country’s east, to cross that milestone in the next few years, too.

“It’s a very tight schedule,” said Lian Hui, a scientist at the lab. Even so, “we are very confident we will be able to achieve BEST’s research goals,” he said.

A National Priority

China’s commitment to science, and fusion, comes from the very top.

The government’s new five-year plan, covering 2026 through 2030, promises “extraordinary measures” to secure breakthroughs in fusion energy and other areas. China’s state-owned nuclear company is preparing detailed fusion research proposals, calling it “the main racetrack in future scientific and technological competition among the great powers.”

The country was a minnow in fusion only two decades ago, and it grew by teaming up with other nations. It worked closely with France to develop its most modern tokamak, a type of doughnut-shaped fusion machine. It became a key contributor to the 33-nation ITER fusion experiment (pronounced “eater”). During much of the past decade, American and Chinese researchers conducted joint experiments and extolled their nations’ “long-term friendship” in plasma physics.

Now, Chinese labs and companies are pouring concrete for cutting-edge research facilities of their own. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Plasma Physics is building both the new BEST tokamak and a 100-acre complex nearby where researchers will develop and test components to operate under the extreme conditions of a fusion device. Scientists there are also sketching out another tokamak that would power a pilot fusion plant in the 2030s and ’40s.

Richard Pitts, a British-French physicist at ITER, visited the BEST site in January last year, when it was little more than an empty platform. Today, it’s half finished.

China has learned a great deal from being part of ITER, and now it is applying that knowledge to make its own advances, Dr. Pitts said. “Every time I go there, I’m taken aback by the sheer numbers of people and the sheer efficiency with which things get done,” he said.

Even if the core technology works, however, fusion reactors won’t power the world until companies figure out how to build and operate them affordably and at industrial scale.

And on that front, China’s expertise in engineering and construction gives it a distinct advantage, said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior fellow at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. “The risk for the United States is we create a viable technical pathway first, but then China engineers and scales it up before we can,” Mr. Goodrich said.

The Laser Path

In the southwest, another front in China’s fusion ambitions is racing ahead with much less public fanfare.

Scientists at the China Academy of Engineering Physics, in Sichuan Province, studied attentively as their counterparts at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California toiled for years before achieving a tantalizing demonstration of fusion’s potential. In late 2022, the lab’s lasers caused a pellet of hydrogen to “ignite,” meaning the reaction produced more energy than the energy from the lasers.

A senior scientist at China’s academy quickly called for his country to follow suit.

Livermore’s achievement marked “a major scientific breakthrough that will be memorialized in the annals of human history,” Zheng Wanguo said in an interview in early 2023. China, he said, should “strengthen investment and research” in fusion energy, “taking laser fusion ignition as the main technical approach.”

Within a year and a half, an enormous X-shaped facility had arisen outside the city of Mianyang.

Chinese laser industry reports, scientific papers and a patent application suggest the site will house Shenguang IV, a new laser ignition facility. Proposals for such a facility, whose name means “Divine Light,” go back in some form over 15 years. But the Livermore lab’s success seemed to put it on the fast track.

The speed of construction in Mianyang is “breathtaking,” said Livermore’s director, Kimberly Budil, given that it took her lab 20 years to build its ignition facility and get it fully running. Still, “operating that system reliably and effectively over time takes meaningful skills, and these are all lessons China will have to learn along the way,” Dr. Budil said.

Scientists at the China Academy of Engineering Physics have reason for secrecy. Like many at Livermore, they work in nuclear weapons research, and laser fusion offers a way to study the conditions of nuclear explosions without detonating actual weapons.

As China’s nuclear stockpile has grown rapidly under the country’s top leader, Xi Jinping, its military has looked for ways to maintain and perhaps upgrade warheads without violating a global ban on test explosions, experts say.

In recent months, the Academy of Engineering Physics has revealed plans to build another laser ignition facility in Chengdu, Sichuan’s provincial capital — a smaller, more commercial sibling to the one in Mianyang.

And Peng Xianjue, once an anonymous weapons designer, has transformed himself into an energy entrepreneur, promoting his vision of an untested type of reactor that would combine fusion and fission. China, Dr. Peng wrote in a proposal this year, should “aim for commercial application by 2040.”

The reason, according to the department, is that American start-ups are already moving quickly toward erecting such a plant.

To some scientists, the U.S. government needs to do more.

Investors have poured about $14 billion into fusion companies worldwide, with $7.6 billion of that going to American firms. “That’s a lot of money, but it’s going to take a whole lot more of that to get this across the finish line,” said George Tynan, a plasma scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Chang Liu worked for years as a physicist at the Energy Department’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Recently, Dr. Liu tried to recruit some younger scientists for his team, but the lab said it didn’t have the budget, he said. Experiences like this, plus family reasons, led him to move to Peking University, one of China’s best. A Princeton spokeswoman said the lab didn’t comment on personnel matters.

In America, the lack of government support is one reason so many fusion researchers are joining start-ups, Dr. Liu said.

Chinese officials, by contrast, are putting significant resources into a possible “ultimate solution” to humankind’s energy needs, he said. “They can really invest in things that are important,” he said.

Does Texas Pacific Land’s (TPL) Stock Split Strategy Reveal a Shift in Its Long-Term Playbook?

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

December 14, 2025

Texas Pacific Land Corporation has already amended its certificate of incorporation to enable a three-for-one stock split, increasing authorized common shares from 46,536,936 to 139,610,808 effective December 22, 2025.

This stock split, combined with fresh analyst coverage and ongoing interest from a major shareholder, could reshape how investors think about TPL’s liquidity and long-term positioning.

We’ll now explore how the three-for-one stock split and higher authorized share count interact with Texas Pacific Land’s existing investment narrative.

Texas Pacific Land Investment Narrative Recap

To own Texas Pacific Land, you generally need to believe in the long-term value of its Permian Basin land, royalty streams and growing water services business, even after a year of weaker share price performance. The three-for-one stock split and higher authorized share count primarily affect trading mechanics and liquidity, and do not materially change the near term earnings outlook or the key risk that revenue growth slows relative to expectations.

The most relevant recent announcement here is the stock split itself, which triples the number of shares outstanding without changing the company’s overall market value. For investors focused on catalysts like continued royalty and water services growth, the split mainly matters if improved liquidity and a lower per share price widen the potential shareholder base and sharpen market attention on how TPL executes from here.

Yet investors should be aware of how any slowdown in royalty production growth could affect...

Texas Pacific Land's narrative projects $895.3 million revenue and $610.3 million earnings by 2028. This requires 7.2% yearly revenue growth and about a $150.1 million increase in earnings from $460.2 million today.

, in line with its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Thirteen members of the Simply Wall St Community currently estimate TPL’s fair value between about US$402 and US$1,791, showing very different expectations. When you set that against the company’s focus on expanding water services as a second growth engine, it underlines how important it is to compare several viewpoints before deciding how TPL might fit into your portfolio.

Most of data centers’ electricity usage is split between operating and cooling massive IT servers.","ANDERSON — Concerns about rising energy costs and the coming of data centers that guzzle water and electricity are driving legislation in the Indiana General Assembly.

According to data from the Citizens Action Coalition, Hoosiers’ electric bills have risen 17.5% within the past year.

That coupled with Gov. Mike Braun telling the Indianapolis Investment Forum in May that the state doesn’t have enough energy to meet the evergrowing demand for electricity has prompted concern from legislators.

During the 2025 session, which was completed early this year, the General Assembly passed legislation to encourage the use of small modular nuclear reactors, to the dismay of some clean energy advocates.

Representatives of the Indiana Conservative Alliance for Energy said they support the development of SMRs, but they noted that state officials shouldn’t overlook incentivizing alternatives such as wind and solar power. “We view current available advanced energy: solar, wind, battery storage as lowhanging fruit,” said Hunter Jones, executive director of the alliance. “The goal is to get electrons on the grid.” Many communities throughout the state have opposed the siting of wind and solar projects. Roughly 80% of Indiana’s 92 Indiana counties have moratoriums on such projects.

Jones feels the opposition is unwarranted — solar and wind energy would reduce costs in the immediate future, whereas SMRs could take decades of development before economic benefits would arise.

“Education and messaging in those communities (that oppose solar and wind projects) could be a lot better,” Jones said. “A lot of the advancements that have been made in the past decade are not the same solar and wind residents have in their mind.”

He also said the state should look into allowing residents to generate power with plug-in balcony solar panels.

In March, the Utah State Legislature passed a law allowing residents to use such devices to generate up to 1.2 kilowatts, enough to power blenders and other light-use appliances, without obtaining a permit or connecting with a utility. These panels cost less than $2,000.

Sam Carpenter, executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, said the panels would pay for themselves within 4-5 years.

Indiana Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, has decided to follow a similar path with Senate Bill 74, which had its first reading Monday.

Plug-in solar panels don’t “need a requirement for utility interconnection, and that’s why they require legislation. The legislation also includes safety standards,” Carpenter said.

State officials could also change how electric bills are calculated.

The Indiana General Assembly’s Utilities Committee recently discussed the possibility of establishing a performance-based electricity pay rate, where a utility would be compensated at a rate based on the reliability and efficiency of the utility and its equipment.

Rates are traditionally calculated based on the utility’s cost of service — in other words, rates are increased or decreased to cover the cost of service.

Jones believes the idea has promise, though Carpenter said there are still too many variables that are unknown.

DATA CENTER CONCERNS

In several communities, Hoosiers have recently voiced concerns about water and electricity usage of data centers. According to the website Data Center Map, 80 data centers are either already built or in development in Indiana.

Most of data centers’ electricity usage is split between operating and cooling massive IT servers.

According to the Hoosier Environmental Council, Amazon’s Northwest Indiana data center project is expected to require 2.2 gigawatts of electricity at peak operating times, enough to power about half of the state’s households.

Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis, has authored Senate Bill 79, which would require developers to disclose the amount of water and electricity a data center is expected to use before a permit can be issued.

The bill would also require data centers to report quarterly use of water and electricity to a working group that would include representatives of electricity suppliers, the data center industry, and representatives of the regional transmission organization in Indiana.

The working group would attempt to forecast the data center industry’s future in the state and submit its findings to the director of the state’s legislative services agency no later than Oct. 26, 2026.

A large data center could use at least five million gallons of water per day, the equivalent needed to serve a population of 50,000 people.

The River Ridge Commerce Center in Jeffersonville will house a Meta data center. Its power plant could treat up to 12 million gallons of water a day, the organization’s chief director, Wendy Dant Chesser, said in a Jeffersonville News and Tribune article.

The Meta data center is expected to be operational in 2026.

Such high volumes of need could strain existing water utilities, so Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, is hoping fellow legislators will take action to protect Indiana’s water resources by passing House Bill 1043.

The legislation would require that developers obtain a water consumption permit from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources before establishing a data center.

Burton is also concerned about the quality of the water discharged by data centers.

“The goal is to make sure our water remains safe, drinkable. ... It’s important that if water is to leave the data center, that it’s safe,” he said.

To develop certain projects, companies often form joint ventures that leverage the expertise of the companies involved to advance projects to reach operational status. The United States has been progressing toward an increased reliance on the gas market as the nation dominates the international gas sector, producing more gas than any other nation. Now, a new conduit known as the Blackcomb Pipeline is reaching towards a 2026 commissioning date.

Joint ventures are often the only way to progress projects towards realization

Joint ventures serve an important purpose across the global energy market. Companies may struggle with certain aspects of a project, and often opt to bring on board other substantially large energy companies to progress operations towards actual, on-the-ground commissioning. With the increased output expected in the US market due to the new focus from the federal government, 2026 is looking good for the US energy market.

The Blackcomb Pipeline project was specifically designed to transport up to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day through an astonishing estimated 365 miles of 42-inch pipeline that will run from the Permian basin to processing facilities in South Texas. The supply of gas that will run through the Blackcomb Pipeline will be sourced from several operations in the Permian Basin.

A new joint venture has been created to advance the Blackcomb Pipeline project

Notably, WhiteWater, a US-based energy company, has formed a joint venture that already owns and operates the Whistler Pipeline to develop the Blackcomb Pipeline. The WPC Joint Venture brings WhiteWater together with Targa Resources to hopefully reach a final investment decision on the planned Blackcomby Pipeline next year.

“We are excited to partner with Targa by leveraging Whistler’s expansive footprint in Waha and Agua Dulce to develop the Blackcomb Pipeline. Blackcomb will provide much needed incremental natural gas takeaway capacity for Permian shippers.” – Christer Rundlof, CEO of WhiteWater

The plan, according to the joint venture, is to reach a final investment decision on the Blackcomb Pipeline project after it has secured a number of agreements with predominantly investment-grade shippers, including:

Devon Energy Corporation

Diamondback Energy Inc

Marathon Petroleum Corporation

Targa Resources

The WPC joint venture will bring invaluable assets to the project, as it has significant long-haul natural gas pipelines that regularly transport natural gas from the Permian basin to processing facilities in Texas. The WPC joint venture owns and operates several pipelines and processing sites in the Permian basin, including but not limited to:

Whistler Pipeline

Rio Bravo Pipeline

70% of the Blackcomb Pipeline

70% of the ADCC Pipeline

50% of the Waha Gas Storage facility

Targa Resources, which forms part of the WPC joint venture, has been developing its plans to build a new 500-mile ‘Speedway’ pipeline in the Permian, exemplifying the substantial assets it brings to the Blackcomb pipeline project. Joint ventures are often the only method to develop energy infrastructure needed to advance projects beyond the planning phase.

The Blackcomb Pipeline project still has a few regulatory barriers to navigate

While the new joint venture will progress the project to reach a final investment decision in the new year, the project is yet to receive the approval of regulators, but expectations are that the process will run smoothly over the coming months as it targets a 2026 operational commencement. The Permian Basin has long been the cornerstone of the US gas market, and over the years, it has attracted interest from some of the largest energy companies in the world, such as the Eiger Express Pipeline, which is also being developed by WhiteWater and its associates.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/48.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:58:26.182663

Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain.
He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition.
But in the meantime, Spain's renewable transition continues.","56 minutes ago

Guy HedgecoeAragón, north-eastern Spain

On the edge of the sleepy town of Figueruelas, a single, vast wind turbine spins around, casting its shadow over the buildings nearby.

It's a reminder of the importance of renewable electricity in this windswept area of Aragón, in north-eastern Spain, whose plains are host to many of the country's wind and solar energy farms.

Figueruela's status as a symbol of Spain's green transition has been further boosted recently, as work starts nearby on the construction of a vast factory that will produce batteries for electric vehicles.

Chinese firm CATL and the Netherlands-based Stellantis are investing a combined €4bn ($4.7bn; £3.5bn) in the facility. Yao Jing, China's ambassador in Spain, described it as ""one of the biggest Chinese investments Europe has ever seen"".

Luis Bertol Moreno, mayor of the town, says the area was a logical choice for the project.

""We're in Aragón, where there's wind all year round, there are lots of hours of sunshine, and we are surrounded by wind turbines and solar panels,"" he says.

""Those [energy sources] will be crucial in generating electricity for the new factory, and I understand that was the key reason for building it here in Figueruelas.""

The factory can be seen as vindication of Spain's energy model, which prioritises renewable sources. In 2017, renewables contributed just a third of Spain's electricity production, but last year they represented 57%.

By 2030, the government wants them to contribute 81% of electricity output.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summarised his government's approach as he delivered a riposte to US President Donald Trump's pro-fossil fuel ""Dig, baby, dig"" slogan. ""Green, baby, green,"" said the Socialist, as he pointed to the benefits of renewable energy.

However, in recent months, Spain's all-in commitment to renewables has come under scrutiny. This was in great part due to an 28 April blackout that left homes, businesses, government buildings, public transport, schools and universities in the dark across Spain and neighbouring Portugal for several hours.

With the government unable to offer a full explanation for the outage, the country's energy mix became a fiercely-debated political issue. Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the conservative opposition, accused the government of ""fanaticism"" in pursuing its green agenda, suggesting that an over-reliance on renewables might have caused the incident.

Feijóo and others on the right advocated a rethink of the national energy model.

The fact that, a week before the blackout, solar generation in mainland Spain registered a record 61.5% of the electricity mix has fuelled such claims.

Yet the government and national grid operator Red Eléctrica have both denied that the outage was linked to the preponderance of renewable energy sources in Spain.

""We have operated the system with higher renewable rates [previously] with no effect on the security of the system,"" says Concha Sánchez, head of operations for Red Eléctrica. ""Definitely it's not a question of the rate of renewables at that moment.""

Ms Sánchez said the blackout was caused by a combination of issues, including an ""unknown event"" in the system moments before, which saw anomalous voltage oscillations.

However, Red Eléctrica and the government are still awaiting reports on the incident that they hope will determine the exact cause. A cyber-attack has repeatedly been ruled out.

Meanwhile, since April, Spain's electricity mix has been modified somewhat, with greater reliance on natural gas, reinforcing the notion that the country is at an energy crossroads.

Spain's nuclear industry, which currently contributes around 20% of national electricity, has been particularly vocal since the blackout, pushing back against government plans to close the country's five nuclear plants between 2027 and 2035.

With many European countries undergoing a nuclear renaissance, the planned closures make Spain something of an outlier. The companies that own the Almaraz plant in south-western Spain, due to be the first to shut down, have requested a three-year extension to its life until 2030. That request is currently under consideration.

Ignacio Araluce, president of Foro Nuclear, an association that represents the industry, says Spain is the only country in the world that is scheduling the closure of nuclear plants that are in operation. He believes nuclear energy provides stability while being compatible with the green energy transition.

""It's prudent to have a mix of renewables and nuclear energy,"" he says.

Mr Araluce praises renewable sources because they only require natural elements to generate electricity, but points out that they are not able to operate around the clock or when weather is unfavourable.

""How can you produce energy in those hours when the renewables are not producing?"" he asks. The answer, he added, is ""with a source like nuclear, that is not producing CO2, that is producing all hours of the year"".

The political opposition is staunchly opposed to the nuclear shut-down. The far-right Vox, criticising what it saw as a lack of explanation by the government for the April blackout, recently described nuclear power as ""a crucial source of stability"".

Ms Sánchez acknowledges that there is room for improvement for Spain's electricity model, pointing to the Iberian peninsula's relative isolation from the European grid compared to most of its EU neighbours. She also sees storage as an issue.

""While we have taken a good path when it comes to renewable installation, we cannot say the same regarding storage,"" she says. ""We need to foster storage installation.""

Spain's political panorama adds an element of uncertainty to its energy future. The Socialist-led coalition has been mired in corruption scandals and its parliamentary majority appears to have collapsed in recent weeks, raising the possibility of a snap election in the coming months.

A right-wing government, which polls suggest would be the likely outcome, would almost certainly place less emphasis on renewables and advocate a partial return to more traditional energy sources.

But in the meantime, Spain's renewable transition continues.

And for Figueruelas, in Aragón, that means not just cheap, clean energy, but investment. The town's population, of just 1,000, is due to increase dramatically, with 2,000 Chinese workers scheduled to arrive to help build the new battery plant, which is expected to create up to 35,000 indirect jobs once it starts operating.

""These kinds of investments revitalise the area, they revitalise the construction sector, hostelry,"" says local man Manuel Martín. ""And the energy is free – it just depends on the sun and the wind.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d24e/live/3992fd80-d72d-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:58:13.929862

This transaction also represents the second collaboration between Repsol and Stonepeak in the U.S. renewables market. In July this year, the two companies closed a similar transaction that included Stonepeak's acquisition of a stake in the Frye solar farm (632 MW) in Texas and the Jicarilla solar and storage complex (145 MW) in New Mexico.

The transaction is expected to close in the coming months, subject to standard regulatory approvals.

João Costeira, Executive Managing Director of Low Carbon Generation at Repsol, said: 'Rejoining forces with Stonepeak, a major investor that continues to place its trust in the quality of our renewable assets in the United States, allows us to advance our growth strategy in this country, where we already have more than 2,800 MW in operation and under construction in solar and storage projects'.

It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.
“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers.
The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023.
The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.","The Conservatives have announced proposals to end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and cut the legal requirement on car manufacturers to sell electric vehicles.

A Conservative government would abolish the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, ending the legal requirement for manufacturers to sell a fixed rising percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year – 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans by 2030, increasing to 100% by 2035. It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.

A future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.

“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”

Writing in the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.

The previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.

The ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.

Doug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.

“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.

“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7ef80140263da04bbc24032051f8c8cb01cde42/681_0_6830_5464/master/6830.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2a43018e4805e251f511e56cf2db8c35",N,,2025-12-14 17:57:57.452539

As of September, electricity prices were up 5.1 percent relative to 12 months prior, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In January, electricity prices were up 1.9 percent from the previous year.

Overall inflation in September hit 3 percent, the same as in January, according to the BLS.

The increase in electricity prices peaked at 15.8 percent in August 2022 amid global energy shortages stemming from the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Increases in electricity demand, particularly during extreme weather events, also drive up utility bills nationwide.

The price of other utilities, such as natural gas, regular gasoline, and heating oil, is expected to be 1 percent higher, 23 percent lower, and 32 percent lower next year relative to 2022, the EIA notes.

Wright, though, said that DOE is “doing everything we can to stop that rise in electricity prices.” The department, at the direction of President Trump, has prioritized slashing regulations on energy companies and cutting funding for green energy projects.

Department officials describe the vehicle as a pilot, not a fleet conversion. The EV is primarily used for urban patrol, traffic enforcement, and administrative duties, allowing officers and city staff to assess real-world performance, operating costs, charging needs, and officer usability.

AAPD leaders emphasize that the single EV does not replace traditional cruisers and is not intended for every policing scenario. High-speed pursuits, long shifts, and operations without reliable access to charging infrastructure remain better suited to gasoline-powered vehicles.

Still, the department says the pilot aligns with Ann Arbor’s broader sustainability goals while offering a practical way to test whether electric patrol vehicles can reduce fuel and maintenance costs over time. Quieter operation has also proven useful in residential neighborhoods and community-policing situations.

Ann Arbor’s limited experiment reflects a measured approach shared by other Michigan police departments.

The Michigan State Police has evaluated electric vehicles for administrative and support roles rather than frontline patrol. Departments in Dearborn, Royal Oak, and other metro Detroit communities have explored or tested EVs for specific functions, often focusing on traffic enforcement, command vehicles, or short-range urban patrols.

Across Michigan, police agencies cite similar factors driving interest: rising fuel costs, long-term maintenance savings, and access to state and federal fleet-electrification incentives. At the same time, departments remain wary of range limitations, winter performance, charging availability, and pursuit capability—especially in rural or high-demand environments.

As a result, most agencies view EVs as situational tools rather than full patrol replacements.

For now, Ann Arbor’s single electric patrol vehicle serves as a test case, offering data and experience rather than a declaration of a full transition.

In the closing weeks of 2025, Tesla Inc. is unleashing a barrage of incentives designed to turbocharge vehicle sales, a move that underscores the company’s aggressive push to clear inventory and maintain momentum amid fluctuating market dynamics. With offers including free premium upgrades on select inventory models, zero-percent APR financing for up to 72 months on the Model Y Standard Range, and zero-down lease options, Tesla is effectively lowering the barrier to entry for potential buyers. This strategy comes at a pivotal moment, as the expiration of federal tax credits earlier in the year has dampened demand, prompting the automaker to pull every lever to stimulate purchases before the calendar flips.

Industry analysts note that these promotions are not merely discounts but a calculated effort to bolster quarterly delivery numbers, which have shown signs of softening. According to recent data, Tesla’s U.S. sales dipped to under 40,000 units in November 2025, marking the lowest figure in years, as reported by Electrek. This decline follows the phase-out of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which had previously buoyed affordability for models like the Model 3 and Model Y. In response, Tesla has layered on incentives that could save buyers thousands, effectively replicating some of the lost tax benefits through direct rebates and financing perks.

The free upgrade program, in particular, stands out as a novel tactic. Eligible buyers selecting from Tesla’s inventory can receive one complimentary premium feature—such as enhanced wheel designs, interior color upgrades, or even towing packages—without additional cost. This offer applies to on-site inventory only and is available while supplies last, adding an element of urgency to the promotion. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Tesla enthusiasts highlight the buzz, with many sharing how these deals are tipping the scales for on-the-fence consumers.

Decoding the Incentive Arsenal

Tesla’s current lineup of promotions extends beyond upgrades to include highly competitive financing. For the Model Y Standard Range, buyers can secure 0% APR for 72 months, a rate that’s virtually unheard of in the automotive sector and could translate to savings of over $5,000 in interest compared to standard loans. Additionally, zero-down leases for models like the Model 3 and Model Y start at $299 per month, making electric vehicle ownership more accessible to a broader demographic. These deals are detailed on Tesla’s official site, but third-party analyses, such as those from Not a Tesla App, emphasize their role in closing out the year strong.

This incentive blitz is part of a broader pattern for Tesla, which has historically ramped up promotions in the fourth quarter to maximize deliveries. In 2025, the urgency is amplified by external pressures, including increased competition from legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors, who are rolling out their own EV models with competitive pricing. Tesla’s approach contrasts with rivals by focusing on immediate value-adds rather than long-term warranties, a strategy that aligns with CEO Elon Musk’s emphasis on rapid iteration and customer satisfaction through software and hardware perks.

Moreover, state and local incentives continue to play a supporting role. As outlined in Tesla’s support resources via Tesla Support, buyers in regions like California or New York can stack additional rebates on top of Tesla’s offers, potentially amplifying savings to $10,000 or more. This patchwork of incentives creates a complex but rewarding environment for savvy shoppers, though it requires careful navigation of eligibility criteria, such as income limits or vehicle qualifications.

Market Pressures and Strategic Shifts

The timing of these promotions coincides with Tesla’s efforts to rebound from a challenging year. Sales data indicates a slowdown in EV adoption rates, attributed to factors like higher interest rates and consumer hesitation over charging infrastructure. Tesla’s response has been multifaceted, including not just price cuts but also enhancements to its product ecosystem. For instance, the inclusion of three months of free Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability and Supercharging with certain purchases adds intangible value, appealing to tech-savvy buyers who prioritize autonomous features.

Comparisons to previous years reveal an escalation in aggressiveness. In 2024, Tesla offered 1.99% financing and free FSD transfers, but the 2025 deals go further with zero-interest options and complimentary upgrades, as chronicled in updates from X posts by influencers tracking the company’s moves. This evolution suggests Tesla is adapting to a maturing market where differentiation through incentives is key to retaining market share, which currently hovers around 50% of the U.S. EV segment.

Critics within the industry argue that such heavy reliance on promotions could erode profit margins, a concern echoed in financial analyses. Tesla’s stock has experienced volatility, with shares dipping amid reports of inventory buildup. Yet, proponents counter that these short-term tactics fuel long-term loyalty, as satisfied customers often become repeat buyers or advocates for the brand’s ecosystem, including solar products and home energy storage.

Consumer Perspectives and Real-World Impacts

From a buyer’s standpoint, these incentives are transforming the purchasing process. Take the Model Y, Tesla’s bestseller: with the free upgrade and zero-percent financing, the effective cost drops significantly, making it competitive against gas-powered SUVs in the same price bracket. Anecdotal evidence from X discussions shows users calculating total ownership costs, factoring in fuel savings and maintenance reductions, which further tip the scales in Tesla’s favor.

Dealership experiences, or rather Tesla’s direct-to-consumer model, enhance this appeal. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla’s online configurator allows real-time customization, with incentives automatically applied. This streamlined approach, combined with rapid delivery timelines—often within days for inventory vehicles—creates a sense of immediacy that’s rare in the industry.

However, not all feedback is glowing. Some potential buyers express frustration over limited inventory for upgraded models, leading to quick sell-outs in high-demand areas. Additionally, the expiration date of December 31, 2025, for most promotions adds pressure, potentially rushing decisions that could benefit from more deliberation.

Broader Implications for the EV Sector

Tesla’s moves are rippling through the electric vehicle domain, pressuring competitors to match or exceed these offers. For example, companies like Rivian and Lucid have introduced their own discounts, though none yet rival Tesla’s zero-interest financing. This competitive dynamic is fostering innovation, with a focus on affordability to counter perceptions that EVs remain a luxury item.

On the regulatory front, the absence of federal tax credits has shifted the onus to manufacturers like Tesla to bridge the gap. Industry insiders speculate that if sales rebound strongly in Q4, it could influence policy discussions in 2026, potentially advocating for reinstated incentives to accelerate the transition to sustainable transportation.

Economically, these promotions are injecting vitality into related sectors, from battery suppliers to charging network providers. Tesla’s Supercharger network, bolstered by free access perks, continues to expand, with over 60,000 stalls globally, reinforcing the company’s dominance in infrastructure.

Innovation Amid Incentives

Looking deeper, Tesla’s strategy intertwines hardware incentives with software advancements. The free FSD trials included in some packages serve as a gateway to subscriptions, where users pay monthly for ongoing updates. This model not only generates recurring revenue but also collects valuable data to refine autonomous driving algorithms, a core pillar of Tesla’s valuation.

Comparisons to tech giants like Apple reveal parallels: just as iPhone upgrades drive ecosystem loyalty, Tesla’s vehicle incentives encourage adoption of add-ons like Powerwall or solar panels. Recent promotions for energy products, as noted in Not a Tesla App‘s overview, bundle vehicle purchases with home energy discounts, creating a holistic value proposition.

Yet, challenges persist. Supply chain constraints, particularly for premium features like advanced batteries, could limit the scalability of free upgrades. Analysts project that if Tesla achieves its delivery targets—potentially exceeding 500,000 units globally in Q4—these incentives will have proven their worth, setting a precedent for future campaigns.

Forecasting the Road Ahead

As 2025 draws to a close, Tesla’s incentive-driven push is a testament to its adaptive prowess. By offering tangible savings and exclusive perks, the company is not just selling cars but cultivating a community of electric vehicle advocates. This approach may well redefine year-end sales tactics across the automotive industry.

For industry observers, the key metric will be delivery figures released in early 2026. If successful, these promotions could stabilize Tesla’s growth trajectory, mitigating the tax credit void. Conversely, underwhelming results might prompt further innovations, such as expanded model variants or international expansions.

Ultimately, Tesla’s current playbook highlights a blend of financial ingenuity and customer-centric design, positioning the company to navigate an increasingly crowded field. Buyers capitalizing on these deals today may find themselves at the forefront of an electric revolution that’s accelerating faster than ever.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3849-1765747879.jpeg,N,,2025-12-14 17:57:49.518053

That means T1 has almost the entire supply chain associated with solar manufacturing and will soon support about 6,000 American jobs.
The simple truth is that T1’s solar manufacturing is American manufacturing.","OPINION:

Michael Kinsley, the great liberal writer and commentator, once noted that some people are always looking for heretics while others are always looking for converts. That trenchant observation may be applicable to a situation in Texas.

There, an American company based in Austin is trying to bring solar manufacturing back to the United States after what has been a generation-long effort on the part of the Chinese Communist Party to destroy that manufacturing capacity in the United States. The company, T1 Energy, owns and operates one of the world’s most advanced solar module facilities in Wilmer, Texas, where it will produce about 3 gigawatts of solar modules this year.

That’s pretty good for an outfit that changed its name last year when the company, then called Freyr Battery, bought a Wilmer factory and various other things from Trina Solar, unfortunately part of the sprawling network of companies owned or controlled by members of the communist regime in Beijing. Soon after the sale, the company changed its name to T1 and made clear it intended to grow and become an integrated solar and battery storage leader owned and operated by Americans.

The company supports tariffs directed at Chinese predatory behavior, including the Section 232 investigation of China’s activities related to solar manufacturing by the Department of Commerce. More important, T1 announced a deal in August with Corning to be a foundational customer for that company’s new ingot/wafer manufacturing facility. That means T1 has almost the entire supply chain associated with solar manufacturing and will soon support about 6,000 American jobs.

Here’s the tricky part: Trina Solar still owns about 20% of the company, according to reports, allowing it a minimum of two board members. That’s important in large measure because federal tax credits require companies to avoid relying on “foreign entities of concern” (a diplomatic way of saying the Chinese Communist Party) for their supply chains. That makes sense; there is no point in strengthening an already powerful and probably hostile adversary.

With all that said, it seems this is one of those cases in which the new crew is trying to fix a problem it inherited. It bought the company and its assets from Chinese owners. Are there still unappetizing people on the board? There sure are, but they own only 20% of the company, which means the good guys own 80%, and you have to think the Texans will solve that problem eventually.

President Reagan used to routinely and correctly note: “The person who agrees with you 80% of the time is a friend and an ally, not a 20% traitor.” That seems like useful context in this case. Whatever future there is for solar manufacturing in this country, it’s going to look like T1 Energy: technologically skilled, practical in business deals, and careful about the generosity and limits of government policies.

The simple truth is that T1’s solar manufacturing is American manufacturing. As CEO Dan Barcelo recently said when he met with Vice President J.D. Vance, “We are investing in energy from America, for America and by Americans … to build a domestic solar supply chain that is scalable, reliable and low cost.”

Electricity and computing power are now the building blocks of national strength. Mr. Barcelo’s company is helping ensure that we have the American energy we need to meet Team Trump’s energy goals and maintain American supremacy in the existential race to master artificial intelligence and command the economic and technological heights for the remainder of this century.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted the company a new patent for an electric vehicle (EV) battery thermal-runaway suppression system, filed on May 28, 2024, and granted on December 4, 2025.

In plain English, this is a built-in emergency fire-suppression system inside the battery pack itself, designed to react when a battery cell starts to fail and heat up uncontrollably. Instead of waiting for that heat to turn into a full-blown fire, the system is designed to attack the problem immediately with a specialized foam mixture.

For future Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep®, FIAT, and Ram EVs and range-extending electric vehicles (REEVs), this kind of tech could become a major selling point—especially for customers still uneasy about EV battery fires.

What Problem Is Stellantis Solving? –

Most modern EVs use lithium-ion or lithium-metal battery cells. Under normal use, they’re safe and efficient. But in a failure scenario—like physical damage, internal short circuits, or severe overheating—one or more cells can enter thermal runaway.

When that happens, the cell temperature rises rapidly, gases are released (some of which are flammable), and heat can spread to neighboring cells. If those gases ignite, you’ve got a battery fire that can be extremely difficult to contain. Fire departments often have to flood battery packs with thousands of gallons of water just to cool them down enough to stop the reaction.

Stellantis’ new system is designed to catch that process early and smother it from the inside, using the battery pack’s own cooling system plus a dedicated fire-retardant supply.

How The System Is Built Inside The Pack –

The patent describes a battery pack that still looks familiar on the outside: a rigid metal housing, rows of battery cells, a cooling system with coolant lines and heat sinks, and pressure vents. The extra technology is layered in around those components.

The key added pieces are:

A bladder filled with a fire-retardant chemical

This bladder is located close to the battery cells, typically between the cells and the top of the pack. It’s made from a flexible polymer, so it can be punctured when needed.

Two sets of blades

– First blades: aimed at the bladder, ready to pierce it and release the fire-retardant chemical.

– Second blades: aimed at specific points on the coolant inlet line, outlet line, or heat sinks to rupture them and release coolant directly into the pack.

Special coolant line sections

The cooling lines and/or heat sinks are built or modified with small sealed apertures—closed off with a soft plug material. These plugs are easy for the blades to pierce but strong enough to hold pressure in normal operation.

Actuation devices tied to a controller

Electric or solenoid-style actuators push the blades into the bladder and coolant components when commanded by the vehicle’s controller.

The system is integrated into the existing battery thermal management system, which already circulates coolant (typically a water/glycol mix) through heat sinks under or around the cells to manage normal operating temperatures.

How It Works In Real-World Terms –

Think of this as an innovative fire-suppression system that lives inside the pack and only triggers when it senses serious trouble.

Continuous Monitoring

Temperature sensors inside the pack monitor battery temperatures. There can be one sensor per module, or even per cell, depending on the design. These send signals to a controller that constantly evaluates whether temperatures are within safe limits.

Detecting Thermal Runaway Conditions

If the controller detects temperatures rising into a zone that indicates a thermal runaway event is occurring or about to occur, it switches from normal cooling to emergency mode.

Triggering The Blades

The controller commands the actuators:

The first blades puncture the fire-retardant bladder.

The second blades pierce the plug-filled apertures in the coolant line(s) or heat sink(s), opening them up.

Creating Fire-Retardant Foam

As the bladder empties, fire-retardant chemical spills into the battery compartment. At the same time, coolant escapes the opened ports under pump pressure. When the two fluids mix, they form a foam specifically formulated to:

Absorb heat

Smother hot surfaces

Help prevent flammable gases from igniting

Extinguish any flames if they’ve already started

Boosting Coolant Flow

The controller can also tell the coolant pumps to speed up, forcing more coolant into the ruptured areas, increasing the volume of foam generated, and helping spread it more quickly throughout the cells.

Managing Internal Pressure

The battery housing has vents with valves that can open if pressure builds up from gas generation during thermal runaway. The patent even suggests pulsing these valves—relieving pressure while keeping as much foam as possible inside the pack to continue suppressing the event.

Why This Matters For Future Mopar EVs And REEVs –

This isn’t just an engineering flex; it’s the kind of system that can directly affect customer confidence and real-world safety for upcoming Stellantis products.

Safer EVs For Everyday Owners

For someone buying a future Dodge Charger Daytona EV, a Jeep® Recon EV, a Chrysler crossover EV, a Ram pickup with a large battery pack, or a FIAT city car, the big question is simple: What happens if something goes wrong?

A system like this gives Stellantis a concrete answer: the vehicle is designed to fight its own battery fire from the insidebefore it becomes catastrophic.

Better Packaging And Potential Weight Optimization

If Stellantis can prove this system is effective, it may allow engineers to optimize how much passive fire protection is needed. That could, over time:

Reduce the amount of heavy shielding

Free up space inside the pack

Improve vehicle efficiency and potentially range

You’re not just making the pack safer—you’re also giving engineers another tool to balance safety, weight, and performance.

Strategic Move For Stellantis In The EV Space –

Patents don’t guarantee production, but this one checks a lot of boxes: it uses familiar components, integrates with existing cooling systems, and leverages proven fire-retardant chemistry. It feels less like a wild concept and more like a production-ready architecture that could roll out with upcoming platforms.

,American Energy,2025-12-14 20:01:00+00:00,LI Press,Op-Ed: Offshore wind is the best energy solution - LI Press,"Long Island Press, George Povall",,,,,https://www.longislandpress.com/2025/12/14/op-ed-offshore-wind-is-the-best-energy-solution/,"Right now, there’s one ready-to-go solution we can’t afford to miss: offshore wind.
And with Long Island’s abundant wind resource, more offshore wind means expensive gas plants don’t have to turn on as often — keeping overall energy prices stable.
Offshore wind’s fixed price delivers cost savings for those of us using that power, compared to scenarios without offshore wind.
Our first operational offshore wind farm is a great example of the rewards moving to renewable energy can give us.
With the upcoming cold season, AI and data center explosion, and ongoing rise in energy prices, now is the time for proven solutions like offshore wind.","The answer is simple supply and demand: to bring prices down and keep up with energy demand, we need to bring more energy supply online and invest in the infrastructure we need to deliver it. New versions of traditional energy generation will need years to come online. Right now, there’s one ready-to-go solution we can’t afford to miss: offshore wind.

Offshore wind is the most readily available resource to meet demand and keep prices stable. This is our best bet to address both the energy affordability crisis and the climate crisis at the same time. Big utility companies don’t own what drives wind turbines; wind is free. And with Long Island’s abundant wind resource, more offshore wind means expensive gas plants don’t have to turn on as often — keeping overall energy prices stable.

The benefits don’t end there. Offshore wind’s fixed price delivers cost savings for those of us using that power, compared to scenarios without offshore wind. Especially those that involve the ever-volatile cost of traditional energy. In fact, if New York’s three planned offshore wind projects had been operational in 2022, we could have saved ratepayers $77M in a single month.

Our first operational offshore wind farm is a great example of the rewards moving to renewable energy can give us. Last year, the South Fork Wind Farm produced electricity 92% of the time, consistently delivering power to 70,000 homes. The data shows South Fork produces energy steadily during the day and peaks in the evening — right when we start to power everything up after work, school, and dinners.

It also helped during times when we needed energy the most. When New York was facing an energy emergency during last summer’s heatwave, South Fork delivered power at close to its maximum potential, helping us avoid blackouts. This is just a preview of what we can expect from other wind farms, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind — if they are allowed to continue.

New York needs to stop looking to the failed energy of the past. With the upcoming cold season, AI and data center explosion, and ongoing rise in energy prices, now is the time for proven solutions like offshore wind.

In the Senate, Republican Senator Ashley Moody announced she was introducing the American Shores Protection Act to prohibit oil drilling and natural gas exploration and development near Florida’s coastline.","A bipartisan bill to protect Florida’s coastline and prevent offshore oil drilling was introduced in Congress.

Florida Congressman John H. Rutherford introduced H.R. 6068, the Preserving Recreation, Oceans, Tourism, Environment, and Coastal Towns in (PROTECT) Florida Act, to prevent drilling off Florida’s coast. This bipartisan legislation codifies President Trump’s moratorium on oil and gas leasing, seismic testing, and exploration in federal waters off the coast of Florida until 2032.

“Florida’s coastal environment is a central part of our state’s economy and way of life,” said Rep. John Rutherford. “Floridians have spoken, and they do not want drilling off their coast. That is why I am proud to introduce the PROTECT Florida Act with my colleagues from Florida. This commonsense, bipartisan bill will ensure our environment is preserved for generations to come.”

This bipartisan legislation with support from members of Congress all over Florida comes after the Department of the Interior announced a Secretary’s Order titled “Unleashing American Offshore Energy,” directing the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to take the necessary steps, in accordance with federal law, to terminate the restrictive Biden 2024–2029 National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program and replace it with a new, expansive 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program by October 2026.

Rutherford was joined by Representatives Jimmy Patronis, Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez, Daniel Webster, Lois Frankel, Gus Bilirakis, Byron Donalds, Maria Salazar, Anna Paulina Luna, Mike Haridopolis, Scott Franklin, Darren Soto, Laurel Lee, Neal Dunn, and Vern Buchanan in the U.S. House.

Florida’s economy relies on healthy and pristine beaches. According to NOAA, Florida’s coastal economy contributes approximately $760 billion to our nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) through tourism, fishing, and recreation.

The PROTECT Florida Act codifies protections for Florida’s coastline against offshore drilling guaranteed in President Donald Trump’s 2020 executive order. It extends the GOMESA protections in the Eastern Gulf and creates a new moratorium for Florida’s Atlantic Coast and the Straits of Florida through 2032.

In the Senate, Republican Senator Ashley Moody announced she was introducing the American Shores Protection Act to prohibit oil drilling and natural gas exploration and development near Florida’s coastline. This legislation would extend the drilling moratorium, which includes the shores of Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, from 2022 to 2032, and would codify President Trump’s September 2020 executive action that protects Sunshine State beaches.",https://westorlandonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Floridacoastline1.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 14:59:47.423738

A new color of hydrogen has been created by Korean scientists, using only oxygen, water, and electricity.
In fact, Korean scientists have created a new color of hydrogen.
A new color of hydrogen has been created Hydrogen comes in various colors, including the turquoise hydrogen that Europe desperately wants for methanol production.
Korean scientists have fortunately created something that could lead to a new color of hydrogen.","This year is rapidly coming to an end, which means we are one year closer to the 2050 net-zero deadline. Presently, the global carbon footprint is high, and carbon emission levels are at an all-time high. Fortunately, nations are working hard to address the issue. A new color of hydrogen has been created by Korean scientists, using only oxygen, water, and electricity. The new method is a breakthrough in renewable energy and has showcased remarkable results.

Hydrogen has become highly in demand, especially for certain colors

The world is working hard to keep its overall carbon footprint as low as possible. Whether at home or at work, the world is focused on going greener. Unfortunately, we still face significant challenges in our greener, low-carbon pursuit, including, but not limited to:

Difficulty in decarbonizing certain industries, such as heavy industry and transport

Excess energy storage and transport difficulty

One element that could address some of these challenges is hydrogen. According to a report by the Environmental Defense Fund, some of the main reasons why hydrogen has increased in popularity include:

Ability to store excess renewable energy long-term

Complementary fuel to battery-electric vehicles

Grid flexibility capabilities

Ability to decarbonize carbon-heavy industries

Improved energy security

Does not emit carbon when burned

However, not all hydrogen types are environmentally friendly, and hydrogen’s color determines how truly eco-friendly it is. Yes, we realise hydrogen is essentially colorless, but the color we are referring to is the method that was used to produce it. In fact, Korean scientists have created a new color of hydrogen.

A new color of hydrogen has been created

Hydrogen comes in various colors, including the turquoise hydrogen that Europe desperately wants for methanol production. Hydrogen can have either a high or low carbon footprint depending on the method used to produce it. A color is assigned to the particular process to represent its carbon footprint, for example:

Brown or Black Hydrogen

Gasification is used to create hydrogen from brown or black coal

Extremely carbon-intensive

Green hydrogen

Water electrolysis is used to create hydrogen

Process is powered by renewable energy sources such as wind power

While green hydrogen is the holy grail, it is still expensive to produce, and the production process is slow. Korean scientists have fortunately created something that could lead to a new color of hydrogen. Find out more below.

Korean scientists just needed this to create it

A research team that consists of Dr. Sung Jong Yoo of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), Professor Chan Woo Lee of Kookmin University, and led by Professor Jin Young Kim from the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Seoul National University’s College of Engineering, has created a new and improved electrochemical catalyst to replace platinum in electrolysis.

Platinum is a costly, precious metal that is used as a catalyst in hydrogen electrolysis. Unfortunately, it also degrades quickly. The newly engineered catalyst is more cost-effective and has showcased higher efficiency and stability, making it a feasible alternative for commercial applications. It consists of a small number of precious metals and comprises a ruthenium-based nanocluster and a core-shell structure.

The core-shell nanocluster catalyst can potentially be used in the following applications:

Industrial applications

Hydrogen power plants

Environmentally-friendly transportation systems

Hydrogen fuel cells for cars

So, by just using oxygen, water, and electricity, and the new catalyst, of course, we could end up with hydrogen that is even ‘greener’ than green hydrogen. However, further development will still be necessary before the new core-shell nanocluster catalyst will be commercially available, and only time will tell how soon that will be. In other hydrogen news, South Korea has opened new 2025 tenders to expand its hydrogen-based power production capacity. Korea sure isn’t playing around!

Tokyo Gas is committing over $1 billion to the US gas and LNG market over the next three years—marking a major play to grow beyond its home turf in Japan.

What does this mean?

Japan’s top city gas provider is eyeing North America for expansion, driven by growing demand for natural gas in sectors like data centers and semiconductor manufacturing. Global enthusiasm for LNG remains strong, which backs Tokyo Gas’s bold strategy. After acquiring Rockcliff Energy last year, the firm recently grabbed a 70% stake in East Texas gas assets from Chevron, aiming to boost returns by ramping up US operations. The company is keen on possible deals involving liquefaction plants or new gas supply contracts, depending on how the market evolves. Meanwhile, Tokyo Gas is treading tricky waters back home, as it relies on Russian LNG under a US sanctions waiver that’s set to expire soon—a situation shaped by geopolitics and government policy.

Why should I care?

For markets: US energy assets are drawing global capital.

Tokyo Gas’s aggressive US expansion signals strong global investor confidence in American natural gas and LNG, especially as worldwide energy demand rises. The company’s latest moves—and its billion-dollar-plus commitment—highlight a long-term outlook for natural gas, even as clean energy talk picks up steam. This ongoing investment could mean more foreign capital flowing into US energy, fresh competition for homegrown firms, and active development in top gas regions.

The bigger picture: Global energy security hinges on diversification.

Tokyo Gas’s strategy spotlights how energy giants are shoring up their supply chains amid geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties. Last year, the company sourced nearly half its 11.56 million metric tons of LNG from Australia, while still relying on sanctioned Russian projects for a significant slice. By snapping up US assets and spreading risks across regions, the firm’s adapting to a world where energy security depends on smart strategy, not just resources in the ground.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Ftag_reuters_com_2025_newsml_L4N3XH1LH_1901071635.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=169ba2e822c103518386be414eec32c6,N,,2025-12-14 15:58:51.078170

Japan Quits Its Vietnam Nuclear Project

Diablo Canyon Agrees to Coastal Commission Land Use Plan

Environmental Groups and others opposed to the reopening of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant thought they’d latched on to a sure thing when the California Coastal Commission told Pacific Gas & Electric (PGE) that the Diablo Canyon Plant needed to set aside 4.000 acres of its site to prevent future development for residential or commercial use.

The outcome of the decision would determine whether the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission would proceed with granting 20-year extensions of the licenses of the two 1,100 MW nuclear reactors at the plant.

PG&E filed its license renewal application with the NRC in November 2023 and the NRC accepted the application for a full review in December 2023. The utility intends to keep Diablo Canyon running until 2045. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is expected to approve the plant’s license renewal application in the first quarter of 2026.

The NRC’s approval depends on PG&E clearing two hurdles in California. The first is a land use plan that needs to be approved by the California Coastal Commission. The second is a certification from California Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board that the reactor site is in compliance with its water quality permit. The plant’s once through cooling system discharges the water back into the Pacific Ocean.

The NRC’s safety evaluation report issued in June 2025 concluded that operator Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) can continue to manage the site safely and within federal regulations. The report’s conclusions followed extensive technical reviews, audits, inspections, and public consultations.

First Up a Land Use Plan

Opposition groups targeted the Coastal Commission’s action calling for setting aside 4,000 acres from further development. The Environmental Defense Center and Mothers for Peace have opposed extending the licenses by 20 years for the two 1,110 MW Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) units at Diablo Canyon every step of the way.

By way of background, environmental organizations thought they’d put a lid on the future of the plant in 2016 with an agreement to close the plant. In June 2016 four leading environmental groups signed on to the agreement to close the twin reactors and replace them with “greenhouse gas free resources,” e.g., solar, wind, and hydro. The groups involved included Friends of the Earth, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Environment California, and the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility.

What happened next is that the State of California discovered that there was not enough generating capacity on the energy mix to cover the gapping hole was carved out of grid capacity once the reactors were shut down.

In response California Governor Gavin Newsome was able to convince the state legislature that the quickest way to be voted out of office was to let the nuclear plants stay dark which had already resulted in energy blackouts and skyrocketing utility costs. The two reactors had provided 10% of all the electricity generated in California.

In 2020 statewide rotating outages during a heat wave helped make his point. What green groups experienced is that you can preach the environmental values of renewable energy, but when people reach for the ‘on’ switch to their air conditioners, and all they hear are crickets, the party’s over.

California experienced an extreme heat wave in August 2020 that caused the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to direct electric utilities in its balancing authority to shed load, or in more common terms, to initiate rolling blackouts.

As expected, popular sentiment came around quickly when faced with stark choice that needed to be made to reverse the Diablo Canyon shutdown order in to keep the lights on and to prevent the California economy from taking a nose dive. In 2022 a state law ordered the plant to stay open for at least five years. It also authorized a $1.4 billion loan to be paid back by a combination of future profits and federal funding sources.

This experience did not deter opposition groups from hitting the Coastal Commission hard in 2025 forcing it to spend months in hearings over the proposed restrictions on land around the plant. However, in the end nine of the 12 commissioners voted to approve the new lands use plan.

In the end, the utility proposed a timeline to conserve up to 6,700 acres of land, create 25 miles of trail easements and put aside $10 million for trail construction to mitigate its operations through 2030. It also committed to a prohibition on selling another 5,000 acres of land through 2040, unless the sale is for conservation.

Meeting Water Quality Standards is the Final Hurdle

The remaining step in the license renewal process is the approval of permits through the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. The plant uses two million gallons a day of water drawn from the Pacific Ocean as a non-consumptive use for cooling purposes. Once the water has done its job, it is discharged back into the bay.

The California Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board is slated to vote in February 2026 on continued Diablo Canyon operations. To allow continued operation of the power plant, the Central Coast Water Board will consider two actions: renewing the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit and issuing a Clean Water Act section 401 water quality certification.

Before the NRC’s license renewals can take effect, the Central Coast Water Board must certify that discharges to ocean waters resulting from the license renewals will comply with California’s water quality standards. (November 2025 staff presentation to the Water Board

Another issue related to regulating Diablo Canyon’s “once through” water use system is how it will protect marine organisms from being harmed by the intake systems. (Fact Sheet)

The same opposition groups will surely focus on these hearings as the decision by the Water Board is the last hurdle in the state’s review prior to the NRC decision whether to grant the license extensions. As they say in the world of Opera, “it ain’t over until the fat lady sings,” so watch this space.

Energy Demand is Growing in California

Diablo Canyon’s future as a key element in the state’s energy portfolio is driven by rising energy demand from data centers. The California Energy Commission says demand from data centers could grow by 4 GW in the next 10 years. The commission anticipates its next forecast will at least double. PG&E’s August 2025 estimate says demand could rise as much as 10 GW by 2035. That equals the energy of nearly five Diablo Canyons.

Diablo Canyon’s extended operations through 2030 are expected to annually reduce greenhouse-gas emissions

equivalent to carbon-dioxide emissions from 1.6 million cars.

Standard Nuclear Moves Ahead with Plans for TRISO Fuel Production

A new prime contract with the Department of Energy provides for a significant expansion of the firm’s capacity to manufacture TRISO fuel for advanced reactors

Standard Nuclear, Inc., a reactor-agnostic producer of TRISO nuclear fuel, announced that it has executed an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), marking a major milestone in an effort to bring privately funded advanced nuclear-fuel production infrastructure online in support of TRISO-fueled reactor demonstrations in 2026. Standard Nuclear is focused on the large-scale production of advanced nuclear fuel and radioisotope power systems.

Under the newly executed OTA, Standard Nuclear will transition key operational elements of its TRISO fuel production operations to full DOE oversight, ensuring adherence to the agency’s contracting framework. This enhanced oversight enables a substantial increase in the company’s TRISO fuel manufacturing throughput within its existing facilities.

Standard Nuclear is drawing on expertise from across the DOE complex to support this transition. The Idaho National Laboratory (INL), operated by Battelle Energy Alliance for DOE, is providing technical assistance through a Strategic Partnership Project (SPP) agreement executed earlier this year. The company is also receiving technical support and specialized training from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Y-12 National Security Complex.

“We’re proud to be the first TRISO fuel manufacturer to execute an agreement of this kind with the Department of Energy ahead of next year’s reactor demonstrations,” said Kurt Terrani, CEO of Standard Nuclear.

“The advanced reactor and fuel technologies now moving into deployment all originate from decades of DOE research and development said Jess Gehin, Associate Laboratory Director, Idaho National Laboratory.

Standard Nuclear Joins DOE Nuclear Fuel Line Program

DOE has conditionally selected Standard Nuclear as the first company to join its newly launched nuclear fuel line pilot program. This initiative is designed to strengthen the domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel, a key component in the deployment of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. Standard Nuclear, based in Oak Ridge, TN, will lead the development and operation of a new nuclear fuel fabrication facility.

The project will also utilize infrastructure in Idaho to support production of advanced TRISO fuel – a next-generation nuclear fuel critical for high-performance reactors currently under development.

The company will be fully responsible for the construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of the facility, while reactor developers will source uranium feedstock through DOE’s High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) allocation program.

The fuel line pilot program directly supports the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program, which aims to bring at least three advanced reactor designs to operational criticality by July 2026. These next-generation reactors are expected to use more efficient, safer nuclear fuel like TRISO. Standard Nuclear said in its press statement the dual approach fast-tracks research, licensing, and deployment of innovative reactor technologies outside of traditional government labs, opening the door for private-sector investment and commercial-scale deployment.

Expanding domestic nuclear fuel capabilities is a strategic national priority. For years, the US has depended on foreign countries, including adversarial powers, for enriched uranium and other critical materials. This reliance introduces supply chain vulnerabilities, especially during times of geopolitical tension.

Earlier this year Standard Nuclear, Inc.,announced its launch from stealth with $42 million in total funding led by Decisive Point with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Washington Harbour Partners, Welara, Fundomo, and Crucible Capital.

Natura Resources Purchases Shepherd Power

The firm Also Partnered with NOV to Deploy Gigawatts of SMRs in early 2030s

Shepherd Power’s expertise in full-scale reactor deployment will accelerate Natura’s ability to provide comprehensive power options for customers, including site, build, own, and operate

Agreement will align Natura’s breakthrough reactor design with NOV’s manufacturing expertise to accelerate commercial deployment of Natura’s molten salt reactor (MSR) technology

Natura Resources LLC, a developer of advanced molten-salt nuclear reactors, has acquired Shepherd Power from NOV Inc. (NYSE: NOV) and signed an agreement with NOV to support commercialization of its small modular reactor (SMR) technology. As part of the transaction, NOV will become an investor in Natura and will appoint a representative to Natura’s Board of Directors.

The agreement will align Natura’s molten salt reactor design with NOV’s manufacturing, supply chain, and project management expertise to support delivery of multiple gigawatts of SMRs for data center and industrial applications between 2029 and 2032.

The acquisition adds Shepherd Power’s reactor deployment expertise, including regulatory and licensing experience, to the Natura team, strengthening Natura’s path to commercial deployment and enhancing the company’s ability to offer a range of industrial power options for customers.

Natura is building SMRs that use liquid fuel dissolved in a molten salt mixture. This design operates at high temperature and atmospheric pressure. It can use several fuel types, including recycled waste fuel and enables harvesting of rare medical isotopes critical for cancer treatment.

The firm said in its press statement that the design of Natura’s 100 MW reactor also will make it an option for produced water desalination, a critical issue for the Permian Basin and other areas of the U.S. with significant oil and gas production.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit in September 2024 for the deployment of Natura’s 1 MW reactor at Abilene Christian University. Natura expects to deploy this reactor in 2026.

Natura plans to file two commercial reactor applications with the NRC before the end of 2025 –one focused on medical isotope production and the other for grid-scale electricity generation. The company expects to deploy its first 100 MW commercial reactor in 2029.

State of New York Invests $40 Million in Nuclear Workforce Development

(WNN) The New York Power Authority (NYPA) will partner with qualified workforce development providers, including technical high schools, community colleges, universities, labour unions, and others to use $40 million in funding to develop nuclear energy technical training, retraining, coursework and apprenticeship programmes to prepare workers for employment in the advanced nuclear energy field.

Hochul’s direction to NYPA, the state’s public electric utility, plans to develop at least 1 GW of advanced nuclear capacity in upstate New York, an area in and around Oswego, NY. The NYPA will develop a ‘Master Plan for Responsible Advanced Nuclear Development’ in New York as part of a $1 billion proposal

In addition to the $40 million, the NYPA Board has awarded $4 million to universities and organizations to develop and expand programs that prepare New Yorkers for high-demand careers in artificial intelligence, electromechanical trades, and advanced power systems to meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

Three nuclear power plants, all in upstate New York, and all operated by Constellation Energy, currently provide 21% of the state’s electricity, and 42% of its carbon-free electricity, according to information from the Nuclear Energy Institute. The state supports the continued operation of the two-unit plant at Nine Mile Point and the single-unit Ginna and Fitzpatrick plants.

GE Vernova Hitachi SMR Design Clears Key UK Regulatory Review Milestone

(WNN) GE Vernova Hitachi announced that its BWRX300 SMR has cleared the second of three phases of the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process at the U.K. Office of Nuclear Regulation. The GDA assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of a nuclear power plant design that is intended to be deployed in Great Britain.

The GDA process is a voluntary, non-mandatory process. Successful completion of the three-step GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability from the Environment Agency.

In May 2021, the UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs). GE Vernova Hitachi submitted a GDA entry application for its BWRX-300 SMR to the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in December 2022. The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH’s ESBWR boiling water reactor.

Step 1 of the GDA of the BWRX-300 began in January 2024 and focused on agreeing the scope and schedule for Step 2. Step 1 was completed in December 2024. It then entered Step 2, which focused on evaluating the fundamental adequacy of the design and its safety, security, safeguards and environmental protection documentation. The regulators have now completed Step 2 of the GDA and issued their Step 2 statements and assessment reports on the GE Vernova Hitachi design.

There are currently no plans to deploy the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 design in Great Britain, and no sites have been identified for its deployment. If an organization decide to progress plans to deploy the BWRX-300 design, the regulators would need to undertake a further period of detailed design assessment before safety-significant construction could begin and environmental permits could be issued. This assessment could be conducted on a generic basis with GE Vernova Hitachi, should the company choose to return to the GDA process to complete Step 3.

“GE Vernova Hitachi opted for a shorter two-step GDA, making it the first requesting party to take advantage of the flexibility we introduced in our modernized GDA process,” said Rob Exley, ONR’s Head of the BWRX-300 GDA.

He added, “This means it is the quickest GDA engagement completed to date.”

Other Firms and the GDA Process

GDAs have previously been completed for the EDF/Areva UK EPR, the Westinghouse AP1000, the Hitachi-GE UK ABWR and China’s HPR1000 designs. A GDA Step 3 assessment is currently ongoing for Rolls-Royce SMR Limited’s small modular reactor design.

In August 2024 a Step 2 assessment began for Holtec International’s SMR-300. In August 2024, Westinghouse’s AP300 was accepted for a GDA review. Last month, TerraPower submitted its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor and energy storage system into the GDA process in the company’s first regulatory step to deploying the technology in an international market.

Japan Quits Its Vietnam Nuclear Project

Reuters reports that Japan has pulled out of plans to build a commercial nuclear power station in Vietnam because the time frame is too tight, Japanese ambassador Naoki Ito told the wire service.

He said, “The Japanese side is not in a position to implement the Ninh Thuan 2 project.”

Japan at one time proposed to develop a nuclear power station for a location on Vietnam’s central highlands with a planned capacity of 2-3 GW.

A key focus of the power plant was to provide electricity to an aluminum smelting plant to move Vietnam up the value chain from simply exporting raw aluminum to developing a manufacturing capacity to produce finished durable goods.

In June, Bloomberg reported Vietnam was seeking discussions with Russia to accelerate its nuclear program and sign an investment cooperation agreement for a first nuclear power station. Vietnam is a global center of manufacturing operations for multinationals including Samsung and Apple. It has had major power blackouts as demand from its huge industrial sector and expanding urban populations often exceed the power available.

Vietnam, which shares a long common border with China, has long aligned itself with Russia to counter balance China’s influence on its economy and politics. Russia has proposed to build up to 4 GW of nuclear power generating capacity in Vietnam. Japan was supposed to have provided another 4 GW for a total of 8 GW. It is unclear whether Russia would commit to an 8 GW project or whether Vietnam could pay for it.

In 2016 Vietnam cancelled a proposal by Russia to build four 1,000 MW VVERs, and four more 1,000 MW reactors to be supplied by Japanese firms, due to the rising costs of the power stations and concerns about the country’s ability to safely manage the construction operations of the reactors.

Construction of the reactors had been set to begin in the province of Ninh Thuan province in 2014. The site is about 350 km / 135 miles northeast of Ho Chi Minh city (formerly Saigon).

The start date was pushed back several times by the government on the grounds that it did not have enough trained nuclear engineers to manage the construction nor the safety regulatory programs needed for a reactor development effort of this size.

In January 2015 Hoang Anh Tuan, head of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Agency, told western news media that the reason for the delays is that the government wasn’t ready to manage the project nor does it have a mature and independent nuclear safety and regulatory oversight agency. A national nuclear safety agency was set up in 2010, but much more work is needed according to this report.

At the time Vietnam did not consider small nuclear reactors because neither the Russians nor the Japanese had commercial units to sell them. Fast forward to 2025, Russia is building SMRs to power mining operations in Siberia but has not, so far, offered them for export. Japan does not currently have a domestic design of an SMR that is economically viable.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/diablocanyon-aerial_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 12:59:21.073845

Among those who feel very well informed about nuclear energy, 66% are strongly favorable and only 6% are strongly opposed.","In a world in which nuclear energy is experiencing a resurgence of interest and action, the determined efforts of groups opposed to the relicensing of the twin 1,100 MW PWRs at the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant flies in the face of global wisdom. According to the World Nuclear Association, as of 12/04/25, 33 nations have signed a pledge to triple the amount of nuclear power on the planet by 2050. That’s a lot of good company for any utility wanting to start, restart, and/or relicense a nuclear power plant of any size or design.

Dr Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of World Nuclear Association said: “The path to tripling nuclear capacity is open, but it demands bold, pragmatic, and visionary leadership. Governments must act now, but the industry needs to deliver and work together with civil society. A cleaner more resilient future is within reach with nuclear energy. We need to move with purpose, investing in solutions that work to shape a tomorrow that is defined by reliability, innovation, and climate responsibility.”

“Tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050, can be achieved, provided governments take immediate and sustained action to deliver on their own national targets for nuclear capacity.”

According to the report global nuclear capacity could reach 1,428 GWe by 2050, exceeding the 1200 GWe target set in the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy set in 2023 at in September 2023 COP28 in Dubai.

Nuclear Opposition Groups Face the Realities of the 21st Century

Closer to home, here in the US sustained commitments to nuclear energy are visible with projects under way to bring five nuclear reactors back from the dead. While the economic drivers of these projects vary, all of them have targeted being in revenue service as quickly as possible, several in the next few years, to meet rapidly growing demand from data centers and other sources of electricity demand resulting from the closure of coal fired power plants. These efforts put the relicensing of Diablo Canyon in good company.

Opposition groups and some elected officials in California don’t like what they see. The implications of the restarts of five reactors, and relicensing of two more at Diablo Canyon, set the examples for future financial investment decisions in small modular reactors as well as potential new full size reactors. The resurgence of nuclear power called for by the World Nuclear Association’s global pledge by 33 nations is well underway in the U.S.

Wikipedia lists 80 anti-nuclear groups in the U.S. These are direct action, environmental, health, and public interest organizations who oppose nuclear weapons and/or nuclear power. It is a real head scratcher why in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, opposition groups are working in California, Michigan, and other places to spike reactor restarts and prevent the development of SMRs are stuck in the middle of the last decades of the last century.

The 1980s and 1990s were dark decades for nuclear energy in terms of spanners tossed into the gears of nuclear R&D with the cancellation of the Integral Fast Reactor. Public fears driven by the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979 were energized by an anti-nuclear movie “The China Syndrome,” which was released just 12 days before the accident.

A lot of lessons have been learned since which is why flogging current reactor restarts with the sins of the past make little sense. Even Japan, with the effects of the Fukushima accident still in the news, is restarting closed reactors and is holding planned to complete reactors that were under construction in March 2011.

Five Reactor Restarts Lead the Way

There are the five reactors being restarted in the U.S. Every nuclear utility in the US is watching their progress towards revenue service especially to see what lessons can be learned about the market for large 1,000 MW+ reactors and demand for electricity based on the rapid growth of data centers and the closing of coal fired power plants.

Holtec – Work well underway for the restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan. According to recent press statements by Holtec, Palisades is on track to restart in early 2026. When it does, it will be the first nuclear plant in the United States to generate electricity again after being decommissioned.

A long-term power purchase agreement signed between Holtec Palisades Energy and the non-profit Wolverine Power Cooperative is a key economic driver of the restart effort. Under the multi-decade agreement,

Wolverine committed to purchasing two-thirds of the power generated from a reopened Palisades, with Wolverine’s partner Hoosier Energy purchasing the balance. It also includes a “contract expansion provision” to include one or two small modular reactors that Holtec plans for the site.

At the time it was taken out of service, the 805 MW Palisades reactor was licensed to operate until 2031. Holtec notified the NRC last year that it intends to apply for a second, or subsequent, license renewal for the plant during the first quarter of 2026. This would extend the plant’s operating period by a further 20 years, to 2051.

As the first mover for reactor restarts in the nation, Holtec has also attracted the most vigorous opposition to its plans. Beyond Nuclear, an anti-nuclear group in Michigan, is opposed to the restart and 20-year license extension of the plant.

It also attacked Holtec’s plans to build two 300 MW PWR type SMRs at the site. A coalition of opposition groups, as described in a 12/06/25 article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, label Holtec as being untrustworthy. Beyond Nuclear’s opposition to the restart of Palisades is long standing. In 2022 it called the project a “zombie reactor restart scheme.”

V.C. Summer – The most dramatic restart announcement of the year is the planned restart of the twin Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000s at the V.C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Brookfield, the Canadian private equity firm that holds a majority share of the ownership of Westinghouse, has been selected by South Carolina utility Santee Cooper to complete two partially built Westinghouse 1,150 MW AP1000 PWR type nuclear reactors.

Brookfield won the V.C. Summer development contract with the main factor being a commitment to paying down $2.7 billion of an existing $3.6 billion obligation Santee Cooper has on the site and sharing ownership and power. Ratepayers have been stuck with the debt since the project collapsed in 2017. Until now there were no prospects to complete the twin reactors.

Neither reactor is even 50% complete. As a result of the uncertainty associated with the cost to complete the two reactors, Westinghouse and its EPC will be expected to make project management and controls for costs and schedules job number one.

In terms of regulatory status, the NRC terminated the combined licenses for the two reactors in March 2019. Santee Cooper and Brookfield will have to submit new applications for construction and operating licenses under the NRC’s Part 50 process. The documentation from the previous COLs for both reactors should, to some extent, make life easier in terms of relicensing the the two units.

For now Brookfield and Santee Cooper are working out the feasibility issues that are a precursor to a final investment decision and bringing an EPC on board to complete the reactors.

Constellation Energy – Efforts to restart TMI-1 in Pennsylvania, now renamed as the Crane Clean Energy Center, is targeting 2027 for revenue service for the 819 MW reactor. A 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft is the incentive for the restart.

Duane Arnold – In March 2025 NextEra Energy filed paperwork with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) indicating its intent to restart the 600 MW Duane Arnold nuclear power plant which is located in Iowa. The reactor was shut down in 2020 after 45 years of operation. The utility has also reportedly communicated with regional grid operators about its plans to be a source of power for new data centers being built in Iowa.

In October 2025 the utility said the plant is targeted to be fully operational by the first quarter of 2029. A key economic driver of the restart is that Google and NextEra Energy sign a 25-year agreement for Duane Arnold’s energy, as well as an agreement to explore deployment of nuclear generation nationwide.

Public Opinion Remains High for Nuclear Energy

According to Bisconti Research, Inc. the American public overall has a favorable view of nuclear energy. Here are some highlights from the 2025 report.

72% favor nuclear energy vs. 28% who oppose. The 2025 National Nuclear Energy Public Opinion Survey finds continued highly favorable public opinion of nuclear energy, despite a slight drop since 2024. Four decades ago, the numbers for favor and oppose were about even.

29% strongly favor nuclear energy vs. 6% who strongly oppose. Those who strongly favor nuclear energy outnumber those who strongly oppose by 5 to 1.

Opinions are not polarized. The myth of polarized public opinion about nuclear energy is a thing of the past. A majority of Americans are fence-sitters on nuclear energy. They somewhat favor or somewhat oppose nuclear energy, with more tending to favor. Among persons with a strong opinion, those in favor outnumber those opposed by 5 to 1.

87% support license renewal, and 64% would build more plants. Opinions about license renewal for “nuclear power plants that continue to meet federal safety standards” and for “definitely building more nuclear power plants” also are favorable in 2025.

Since these questions were first asked in 1998, most of the public has agreed with license renewal of nuclear power plants that meet federal safety standards. In contrast, barely half the public (47% in 1998) supported definitely building more nuclear power plants. Those agreeing that we should definitely build more plants rose in recent years to a high of 72%. While that number fell 7 points between 2024 and 2025, it remains high.

A Call to Action for the US Nuclear Industry

The Bisconti report contains data that should be taken as a call to action by the U.S. nuclear industry.

According to the Bisconti report,one of the reasons why so many Americans take middle positions on nuclear energy is that they don’t feel very well informed about this energy source.

In 2025, only 15% feel very well informed on the topic, 47% somewhat well informed, 31% not too well informed, and 7% not at all well informed. The correlation between the level of feeling informed and attitudes is striking. Among those who feel very well informed about nuclear energy, 66% are strongly favorable and only 6% are strongly opposed.

It is time for the nuclear industry’s trade organizations as well as scientific and educational organizations to ramp up their efforts to inform the public about the current progress being made with reactor restarts and the potential for entirely new builds of small modular reactors, advanced reactors of all sizes, and new 1,000 MW+ units.

A Strategic Reset, Not a Retreat The end of the Ford–SK On joint venture does not signal an abandonment of electric vehicles.","DEARBORN — Ford Motor Co. and South Korean battery manufacturer SK On are unwinding one of the most ambitious electric-vehicle bets of the past decade, ending their $11.4 billion joint venture to build EV battery plants in the United States as demand for electric vehicles softens and federal policy signals shift.

The move marks a sharp reversal from 2021, when Ford and SK On announced plans to construct multiple battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, a deal that was widely seen as a cornerstone of Ford’s long-term electrification strategy. At the time, soaring EV sales projections, generous federal incentives and tightening fuel economy standards pushed automakers to move aggressively into battery production.

Four years later, the EV landscape looks far more uncertain.

EV Market Hits a Reality Check

Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. have slowed through 2025, with battery-electric vehicles accounting for less than 10 percent of new light-duty vehicle sales. After years of double-digit growth, EV sales have flattened and, in some months, fallen sharply year over year.

Industry analysts point to a combination of factors: the rollback or narrowing of federal EV tax credits, high interest rates that have pushed monthly payments higher, and ongoing consumer concerns about charging infrastructure and resale values. At the same time, revised federal fuel-economy standards are expected to give gasoline and hybrid vehicles more breathing room, easing pressure on automakers to rapidly expand all-electric lineups.

Hybrids, which offer improved fuel efficiency without the need for charging, have gained market share faster than full battery-electric vehicles — a trend automakers are now leaning into.

How the Breakup Will Work

Under the terms of the dissolution:

SK On will take full control of the Tennessee battery facility, known as the BlueOval plant.

Ford will assume ownership of two adjacent battery plants in Kentucky, previously part of the joint venture.

SK On formally initiated the move to dissolve the partnership but says it plans to continue working with Ford around the Tennessee facility. The company says operating independently will allow it to improve productivity, increase operational flexibility and accelerate growth in its North American energy storage business.

Federal Loan Reassessed

The breakup also triggers a reassessment of a government loan originally approved at up to $9.6 billion to support the joint venture. Under the current administration, the loan is being restructured and reduced to limit taxpayer exposure and ensure faster repayment.

According to Bloomberg, the revised structure is designed to “reduce exposure to taxpayers and ensure prompt repayment.” Ford is working voluntarily with the U.S. Department of Energy to repay its portion more quickly than initially planned.

Ford’s EV Losses Mount

The decision comes as Ford continues to absorb heavy losses in its EV business. The automaker lost $5.1 billion before interest and taxes on its electric-vehicle operations in 2024 and expects losses to grow in 2025.

Chief executive Jim Farley has warned that under current market and policy conditions, U.S. EV sales could fall by as much as 50 percent, forcing automakers to slow investment and refocus on profitability.

“We believe the writing was on the wall this partnership was not going to work moving forward,” Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives told the Detroit Free Press. “Ford has to make some difficult moves, and this was a smart strategic one to rip the band-aid off.”

Michigan Impact: What It Means at Home

For Michigan, the breakup underscores the uneven pace of the EV transition — and the growing tension between long-term electrification goals and near-term economic realities.

Michigan remains the epicenter of U.S. auto manufacturing, with billions invested in EV assembly plants, battery research, and supplier retooling. But as EV sales slow, suppliers across the state face longer production timelines and increased uncertainty around volume forecasts.

Utilities and regulators are also watching closely. Large-scale EV and battery investments have raised concerns about electric grid capacity, infrastructure costs, and ratepayer impacts, issues that have already sparked pushback in rural Michigan communities where data centers and energy-intensive facilities are proposed.

At the same time, Ford and other automakers are signaling a renewed emphasis on hybrids and advanced internal-combustion technologies — segments that support existing Michigan jobs while buying time for EV markets to mature.

A Strategic Reset, Not a Retreat

The end of the Ford–SK On joint venture does not signal an abandonment of electric vehicles. Instead, it reflects a broader recalibration underway across the auto industry as companies adjust to slower adoption, shifting policy priorities and the need for tighter capital discipline.

Battery makers are increasingly cautious about overcapacity, while automakers are dialing back the scale and pace of EV investments once assumed to be inevitable. In that context, the breakup stands as a clear marker of how quickly the EV boom has cooled — and how pragmatism is replacing ambition as the industry charts its next phase.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FordSKEV.webp,N,,2025-12-14 12:00:03.180860

With utility bills on the rise, most homeowners are increasingly looking for ways to cut down their power bills. Depending on where you live, you may find yourself at a crossroads, wondering whether switching to a heat pump is worth the cost. They are known for being more costly to install than conventional HVAC systems, but they can be cost-effective over time, reducing your power consumption by a staggering 75%, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Plus, they always pull double duty year-round, allowing homeowners to heat and cool their homes with the same setup.

But despite their massive perks, if you've spent your time scrolling through online forums that talk about heat pump upgrades, you've probably come across a statement like, ""heat pumps don't work in cold weather."" And given that this claim is repeated so often, you might take it as a fact. But is it truly factual? The simple answer is no, although it is a myth that used to be true.

Heat pumps are typically vulnerable during harsh winters. After all, they usually keep your home warm when temperatures drop by extracting heat from the outside air and transferring it indoors. This means that when it gets cold enough to freeze, the pumps will have little to no heat to absorb, reducing their efficiency. Older models struggled with this issue, but great strides have been made to make it easier for heat pumps to extract sufficient heat from freezing outdoor air, more efficiently than before.

Generally speaking, modern heat pumps are a completely different story from those of the '80s and '90s, and even some of the early 2000s. Today's cold-climate models, like the Mitsubishi Hyper-Heating FX-Series (available on Amazon), feature advanced technology that provides warmth for your home even when the temperature outside dips below -13 degrees Fahrenheit. These models are specifically built to maintain strong heating output during extreme cold months, thanks to inverter-driven compressors and advanced refrigerants.

However, it's worth noting that although cold-climate heat pumps might still operate at 100% capacity, they will typically cost more. If you're trying to keep your home comfortable across all seasons while avoiding skyrocketing bills, you'll probably want to consider a hybrid heat pump. As a hybrid, this model comes with two systems: an electric heat pump that handles your heating needs when outdoor temperatures are mild to moderate and a furnace that can save the day when conditions are frigid.

Even beyond the ""heat pumps don't work in cold weather"" myth, there is still a ton of misinformation out there about these energy-saving appliances. Money is always a major factor when considering which type of heating system to get, and unfortunately, the idea that heat pumps are affordable is one concept that people don't believe. While there's some veracity to the idea that they're prohibitively expensive — hybrid and cold-climate models carry a higher upfront cost than standard models — but it's not true in all situations. After all, when you factor in home energy rebates, tax credits under programs like the Inflation Reduction Act, and energy savings, a modern heat pump will suddenly become much more affordable since the installation costs will be slashed by hundreds or thousands of dollars.

You might also hear the misconception that heat pumps are quite noisy. While this might have been true a few decades ago (since older units have a reputation for rattling and whining), today's pumps are built to run with a low hum. In fact, most operate at 40–60 decibel levels, which is similar to that of a refrigerator or a normal conversation. There is also the issue of maintenance. You might believe that heat pumps are more difficult and expensive to maintain than standard systems. But that's not true. Their upkeep is the same as that of a standard HVAC system. You'll just need to clean or replace the air filters, schedule annual maintenance service, and keep the outdoor unit clean.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/dont-believe-this-extremely-common-heat-pump-myth/l-intro-1765452877.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 11:02:53.205423

The judges said El Paso Electric’s proposed shareholder profit margin made up $38 million of the total requested rate increase.
El Paso Electric sought to change the solar customer fee – which would have likely resulted in an increase to rooftop solar customers.
“Regarding New Mexico, we have not yet finalized our filing, the revenue requirement or calculated residential customer impacts,” El Paso Electric said in its statement.","The proposed bill increase by El Paso Electric that could take effect next year may be decreased after a panel of judges overseeing the utility’s rate case sided with customers and suggested moderating it.

A final decision on the rate increase by the state’s Public Utility Commission likely won’t come until February. But the judges on Dec. 7 issued a proposal for decision – a recommendation for the state’s public utility commissioners – that argued El Paso Electric is asking to make too much profit off customers.

Instead of authorizing the requested shareholder profit margin of 10.7%, the PUC should approve an allowed return of 9.4% that’s close to the utility’s current authorized profit margin.

El Paso Electric is evaluating the panel’s recommendation, the utility said in a statement.

“Because this is an ongoing regulatory proceeding, we are not in a position to comment on specific recommendations included in the Proposal for Decision, including customer charge levels, return on equity, revenue requirement adjustments, or the treatment of distributed generation customers,” the utility said.

Since it filed to raise rates in January, El Paso Electric has argued it needs to collect about $85 million more annually from customers to pay off $1.55 billion in various investments it made between 2021 and 2024, such as the $217 million Newman 6 power plant unit that started operating in 2023.

Monopoly utilities can’t set their own rates. Instead, utilities have to seek approval from state public utility commissions to raise their rates to recover money they’ve spent on investments such as substations or power plants – plus their authorized profit margin.

The judges said El Paso Electric’s proposed shareholder profit margin made up $38 million of the total requested rate increase.

El Paso Electric’s original request would raise average monthly bills from $96 to $118.

It’s difficult to calculate how the recommendation from the judges overseeing the case would impact bills, but it’s likely the increase will be lower than the $22 proposed if the PUC adopts the recommended decision when commissioners vote early next year.

The judges recommended the PUC hold the flat monthly customer charge at $9.25 rather than the proposed $13.71. That would take off $4.46 of the proposed $22 per month increase. And if the PUC approves the 9.4% shareholder profit margin over the 10.7%, it would mean a smaller increase for customers.

A big part of the rate case involves what to do with customers who have rooftop solar panels. The utility currently charges a $30 minimum bill for rooftop solar customers, arguing they still rely on the grid when their panels aren’t producing electricity.

El Paso Electric sought to change the solar customer fee – which would have likely resulted in an increase to rooftop solar customers. But the judges recommended keeping the current fee in place and said the utility hasn’t studied closely enough how those customers affect the electric grid and the utility’s costs.

A coalition of pro-solar organizations known as the Joint Solar Advocates weighed in on the ruling, saying they largely supported the judges’ conclusions.

“The Joint Solar Advocates are generally supportive of the outcome in the recommended decision,” the group said in a statement to El Paso Matters. “Importantly, the (case’s judges) agreed that there is no cost-basis for a unique demand charge on customers that choose to install their own solar panels to meet part of their electricity needs.”

The solar advocates – which include the national nonprofit Solar United Neighbors and other pro-rooftop solar groups such as Public Citizen and Amanecer Peoples’ Project – say El Paso Electric should conduct a detailed study to look at the benefits rooftop solar customers bring as a decentralized source of electricity generation. And they want the utility to pay customers more for the electricity their panels produce.

That kind of study “is what’s really needed so that EPE and customers can make a more informed decision on adopting rooftop solar,” the joint statement said. “The study will also speak to the appropriateness of EPE’s minimum bill for solar customers, and the utility’s compensation rate for those customers’ energy exports back to the grid.”

RELATED: As rate increases loom, El Paso households could see utility bills jump $45 a month in early 2026

Separately, El Paso Electric told the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission that it plans to apply to raise rates for its customers in New Mexico in February, likely after the Texas rate case is resolved. The utility in 2024 had more than 459,000 customers, including 107,000 New Mexico customers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

El Paso Electric didn’t provide details yet to the NMPRC about what the rate increase in New Mexico could look like – for example, whether rates would rise more for residential, commercial or big industrial customers.

However, in the utility’s Texas rate case, El Paso Electric said it needs to bring in $140.7 million more from all of its customers, annually, to cover the cost of investments and operations, including $85.7 million more from all of its Texas customers. That would indicate the utility needs to collect about $55 million more from its New Mexico customers – a 38% increase in revenue.

“Regarding New Mexico, we have not yet finalized our filing, the revenue requirement or calculated residential customer impacts,” El Paso Electric said in its statement.

El Paso Electric plans to spend $4.4 billion in capital projects over the next five years as spending across the U.S. utility industry has accelerated rapidly in recent years.

Most of that spending is driven largely by the construction boom of power-hungry data centers and increased electricity demand for air conditioning in homes and businesses caused by climate change and higher average temperatures.

Other universities, including UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, are making strides in solar efficiency and bioenergy research, while the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Michigan are focused on modernizing the power grid and enhancing energy storage capabilities.

Beyond technical training, schools like Southwestern University and the University of Minnesota, Morris, are weaving renewable energy into campus life, achieving complete reliance on renewable electricity through Renewable Energy Credits. These campuses serve as real-world testbeds, equipping students with practical experience while showcasing scalable solutions.

Building the Workforce: Addressing Skills Shortages

The rapid expansion of clean energy has led to a significant demand for skilled professionals, especially in fields such as solar installation, wind turbine maintenance, and energy storage engineering. To meet this need, universities are partnering with industry and government agencies. For example, the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office supports initiatives like Bright Solar Futures in Philadelphia, which prepares high schoolers and young adults for careers in solar installation. The Gulf Research Program has also invested millions in projects like the Texas Green Careers Academy, helping residents in Gulf States transition into clean energy roles.

Community colleges and technical schools are equally important. The Solar Energy Industries Association works with these institutions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in the workforce. Meanwhile, platforms such as IREC’s Green Workforce Connect link job seekers with training and employment opportunities. State programs, like Maryland’s Offshore Wind Workforce Training, further demonstrate how local efforts are broadening access to clean energy careers.

Employment Growth and Ongoing Challenges

Today, more than 3.6 million Americans work in the renewable energy sector, with solar energy supporting over 7 million jobs worldwide. The IRA has spurred over $300 billion in clean energy investments, resulting in hundreds of thousands of new positions in solar, wind, and battery manufacturing. According to the 2024 U.S. Energy and Employment Report, clean energy jobs grew by 4.2% in 2023, outpacing the overall economy.

Despite this growth, the sector faces persistent hurdles. There is a notable shortage of skilled workers in construction and manufacturing, particularly as experienced tradespeople retire. The need for hybrid expertise—combining technical know-how with digital skills like energy analytics and artificial intelligence—is also increasing. Academic programs are evolving to meet these demands, but scaling up will require ongoing investment and supportive policies.

Investment Patterns: Universities as Innovation Hubs

Research conducted by academic institutions is increasingly shaping investment strategies in the clean energy space. For example, financial analyses from Duke University have influenced approaches to sustainable infrastructure. Tax incentives from the IRA have enabled colleges, such as Roxbury Community College, to launch geothermal and solar projects.

Private investors are also taking notice. As renewable technologies become more affordable, collaborations between universities and private partners are driving innovation in areas like energy storage and hydrogen solutions. However, the recent cancellation of funding for more than 200 energy projects by the Department of Energy highlights the sector’s sensitivity to policy changes.

Global EV sales growth slowed to 20% in 2025 from 40% the prior year, per International Energy Agency data.
But with sales teetering, 2025 serves as a critical test of resilience in an industry where innovation alone may not suffice.","As Tesla Inc. navigates a turbulent 2025, the electric-vehicle giant finds itself in a precarious position, racing against time to stem a potential second consecutive year of declining sales. Recent data paints a stark picture: U.S. sales plummeted to under 40,000 units in November, marking the lowest monthly figure in nearly four years. This downturn comes despite aggressive discounting and the introduction of more affordable models, underscoring deeper issues within the company and the broader market for battery-powered cars. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, has been vocal about external pressures, but insiders and analysts point to a mix of internal missteps and shifting consumer sentiments.

The expiration of federal EV tax credits at the end of 2024 has exacerbated the situation, removing a key incentive that once buoyed demand. Tesla responded by slashing prices on its flagship Model 3 and Model Y, rolling out “Standard” variants priced as low as $35,000 to attract budget-conscious buyers. Yet, these moves have failed to ignite sales, with estimates from Cox Automotive showing a 20% drop from October’s figures. According to a report in Reuters, even the Cybertruck, Tesla’s much-hyped electric pickup, has underperformed, contributing only marginally to overall volume.

Musk has attributed some of the blame to broader economic factors, including high interest rates and a slowdown in global EV adoption. On social media platform X, formerly Twitter, he has posted about supply chain constraints echoing past challenges, such as chip shortages that hampered production in previous years. However, critics argue that Tesla’s aging lineup—dominated by models like the Model 3 and Y, which haven’t seen major refreshes in years—has left the company vulnerable to fresher competition from rivals like BYD Co. and Ford Motor Co.

Aggressive Discounts and Their Limits

In a bid to reverse the slide, Tesla has unleashed a flurry of promotions, including zero-interest financing for up to 72 months on select models and referral bonuses worth thousands in credits. These incentives, detailed in a recent article from Business Insider, aim to clear inventory and boost deliveries before year-end. The company is targeting a narrow window to surpass 2024’s sales total of about 1.8 million vehicles globally, but with only weeks left, the math looks daunting. Analysts project that without a miraculous December surge, Tesla could see its first back-to-back annual declines since its early days as a startup.

This strategy isn’t new for Tesla; price cuts have been a hallmark of Musk’s playbook, often used to stimulate demand during lulls. But the current environment differs. The end of tax credits has leveled the playing field, making Tesla’s offerings less competitively priced against gasoline vehicles, especially as oil prices stabilize. Moreover, consumer hesitation stems from concerns over charging infrastructure and range anxiety, issues that Tesla’s Supercharger network has mitigated but not eliminated entirely.

Adding to the complexity, Musk’s public persona and political involvements have alienated some potential buyers. Surveys from industry groups indicate that a portion of the liberal-leaning EV buyer base has soured on the brand amid Musk’s outspoken support for certain policies and figures. While Tesla maintains a loyal following, this backlash has contributed to softer demand in key markets like California, where sales dipped 15% year-over-year in the third quarter.

Global Pressures and Competitive Shifts

Expanding beyond the U.S., Tesla’s international performance tells a similar story of strain. In China, the world’s largest EV market, sales fell 6% in November, per data referenced in posts on X, as local players like BYD undercut prices with government-backed incentives. Europe hasn’t fared much better, with a 30% drop attributed to regulatory hurdles and economic slowdowns. A piece in The Times of India highlights how cheaper Tesla variants failed to spark interest, even as the company ramped up production at its Shanghai Gigafactory.

Musk has downplayed these figures, emphasizing long-term bets on autonomy and artificial intelligence. In recent X posts, he reiterated Tesla’s focus on self-driving technology, predicting that software updates like Full Self-Driving (FSD) version 13 will revolutionize the industry. Yet, regulatory scrutiny from bodies like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration continues to delay widespread deployment, limiting FSD’s revenue potential in the short term.

Competitors are capitalizing on Tesla’s vulnerabilities. Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. have introduced models with superior range and luxury features, while traditional automakers like General Motors Co. push affordable EVs subsidized by their vast dealer networks. Tesla’s reliance on direct sales, while innovative, leaves it exposed in regions with poor online penetration or where physical showrooms matter.

Internal Challenges and Leadership Focus

Inside Tesla, the sales slump has prompted a reevaluation of priorities. Musk, who juggles roles at SpaceX, xAI, and now advisory positions in the U.S. government, has admitted to stretching thin. X posts from earlier this year reveal his return to “sleeping in conference rooms” to oversee critical projects, including Starship launches and AI integrations. This divided attention, some executives whisper, has slowed decision-making on new vehicle development, such as the long-awaited affordable “Model 2” compact car.

Financially, the picture is mixed. While vehicle sales falter, Tesla’s energy storage business—bolstered by Megapack batteries—posted record revenues, offsetting some automotive losses. Stock investors, as noted in a report from Parameter, seem unfazed, with shares rising 3% despite the November data, betting on AI-driven growth over traditional carmaking.

Critics, however, warn that ignoring core automotive execution could prove costly. Aging factories and supply chain bottlenecks, reminiscent of 2021’s chip crisis that Musk publicly lamented, persist. Tesla’s Fremont plant, for instance, operates below capacity, hampered by labor disputes and parts shortages.

Strategic Pivots and Future Bets

To counter these headwinds, Tesla is doubling down on innovation. The company plans to unveil a revamped Model Y in 2026, incorporating advanced battery tech for longer range and faster charging. Musk has teased robotaxi services as a game-changer, potentially generating billions in recurring revenue once regulatory hurdles clear. Insights from Electrek suggest that without tax credits, Tesla may lobby for new incentives or explore partnerships with governments to subsidize infrastructure.

Yet, skepticism abounds. Analysts from firms like Morgan Stanley question whether these futuristic bets can sustain the company through immediate sales droughts. The Cybertruck’s production ramp-up, plagued by quality issues, exemplifies the risks: initial hype gave way to recalls and customer complaints, further denting brand perception.

Musk’s leadership style—bold, unfiltered, and often controversial—remains a double-edged sword. His X commentary on topics ranging from population decline to AI supremacy keeps Tesla in the headlines, but it also invites scrutiny. For instance, recent posts defending Tesla’s autonomy edge over rivals like Waymo have rallied fans, yet failed to translate into sales momentum.

Market Realities and Consumer Sentiment

Broader market dynamics reveal a maturing EV sector where early adopter enthusiasm wanes. Global EV sales growth slowed to 20% in 2025 from 40% the prior year, per International Energy Agency data. Tesla, once the undisputed leader, now holds about 15% market share, squeezed by hybrids that offer a bridge for hesitant buyers.

Consumer surveys, including those cited in Torque News, point to Musk’s polarizing politics as a factor in brand aversion. One respondent quipped that buying a Tesla feels like “endorsing a worldview,” prompting some to opt for alternatives like the Chevrolet Bolt or Hyundai Ioniq.

Despite these challenges, Tesla’s ecosystem—encompassing solar products, home batteries, and a vast charging network—provides a moat. The company’s vertical integration allows for cost efficiencies that peers envy, potentially enabling deeper discounts without eroding margins entirely.

Path Forward Amid Uncertainty

Looking ahead, Tesla must balance short-term fixes with long-term vision. Insiders suggest accelerating the Model 2 launch to under $25,000 could recapture entry-level buyers, especially in emerging markets. Musk has hinted at this in X discussions, stressing the need for volume production to replace the global fleet of internal-combustion vehicles.

Regulatory environments will play a pivotal role. In the U.S., potential policy shifts under new administrations could reinstate incentives, while Europe’s stringent emissions rules might favor EVs. Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory expansion aims to tap this, targeting 1 million annual units by 2027.

Ultimately, Tesla’s fate hinges on execution. As Musk refocuses on core operations, the company could emerge stronger, leveraging its tech prowess to outpace rivals. But with sales teetering, 2025 serves as a critical test of resilience in an industry where innovation alone may not suffice.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3828-1765673699.jpeg,N,,2025-12-14 10:01:22.464901

Driving sustainable practices in manufacturing

Julie Chapman, head of manufacturing and engineering at Duncan & Toplis explains

Sustainability and environmental responsibility have shifted from being a ‘nice to have’ to an essential part of business strategy. For manufacturers, this isn’t just about meeting expectations —it is about staying competitive and aligning with the UK’s ambition to reach net zero by 2050.

Julie Chapman, head of manufacturing and engineering at Duncan & Toplis, said: “Manufacturing is an extremely energy-intensive industry.” Government data shows the sector emitted around 71 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2023, making decarbonisation a significant challenge. Yet, with Industry 5.0 ushering in a new era, technology is transforming the way manufacturers operate sustainably.

Introduced in 2021 as the ‘5th Industrial Revolution’, Industry 5.0 goes beyond connectivity and automation to address sustainability and societal impact. Ms Chapman explained: “It is not just about contributing to a healthier planet — environmentally driven practices can streamline processes, future-proof strategies and secure financial growth.” Across the UK, manufacturers are embedding sustainability into everyday operations, from factory floors to supply chains, to minimise environmental impact and conserve resources for future generations.

Technology plays a pivotal role in this transformation. Industry 5.0 emphasises collaboration between robotics, bionics and people, creating ultra-modern facilities where automation drives efficiency. By leveraging AI and the Internet of Things, manufacturers can reduce energy consumption, minimise waste through precision, and optimise supply chains. Highlighting how innovation is reshaping traditional workflows, Ms Chapman added: “Processes are becoming smarter and leaner.”

Renewable energy adoption

Reshoring is another trend gaining momentum. Encouraging UK production not only supports local economies but also delivers environmental benefits by reducing transportation emissions. Producing goods closer to where they are consumed cuts reliance on carbon-intensive global supply chains and strengthens the UK’s commitment to ‘net zero’. Renewable energy adoption is also accelerating, with manufacturers increasingly turning to wind, solar and hydro power. Significant investment in offshore wind, carbon capture and hydrogen technologies promises even greater progress in the years ahead.

Sustainability now begins at the design stage. Manufacturers are sourcing raw materials responsibly and prioritising recyclable or recycled components. Packaging is evolving too, with cardboard and paper replacing plastics to reduce environmental impact. Transport and logistics remain critical, as travel miles contribute heavily to emissions. Switching to electric or hybrid vehicles, alternative fuels like biodiesel, and even high-speed rail are helping manufacturers cut their carbon footprint.

The benefits of these changes extend beyond ecology to economics.

Improving efficiency through technology, reducing reliance on global supply chains and embracing renewable energy all lead to cost savings. Ms Chapman continued: “The case for ecological is also the case for economical.” Innovative solutions that reduce environmental impact can also unlock tax relief opportunities. The Government offers R&D tax incentives for businesses tackling scientific or technological challenges, whether by creating new processes or improving existing ones. These measures not only reduce tax liabilities but also build financial resilience, enabling reinvestment and continuous improvement.

The 2026 CAP Implementation Grant application round resulted in 222 approved projects that counties may complete over the next 12 to 24 months, resulting in an estimated reduction of more than 113,493 pounds/year of nitrogen, 28,816 pounds/year of phosphorus, and 11.8 million pounds/year of sediment delivered to the Chesapeake Bay. Pennsylvania has reduced more than 10 times the amount of nitrogen in the past 5 years than in the previous ten years, and water quality monitoring data shows significant improvements in nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment levels.

“Pennsylvania’s clean water successes are rooted in collaboration—state, local, federal, legislative, and non-governmental partners, and of course landowners,” said DEP Secretary Jessica Shirley. “The work will continue to evolve, and our focus will remain on setting our collaborative partnerships up for success well beyond 2025. The momentum is real, and you can see it in our improved water quality.”

The Chesapeake Executive Council is composed of the Governors of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting the Chesapeake Executive Council also approved the revised Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. The refreshed Watershed Agreement commits signatories to address nutrient and sediment goals and outcomes by 2040, with a midpoint assessment in 2033, coinciding with the 50-year anniversary of the Chesapeake Bay Program. Under the Shapiro Administration, Pennsylvania has accelerated progress toward its clean water goals by investing new financial resources, targeting high performing pollution reduction strategies, implementing innovative technical solutions, listening to local leaders and stakeholders, and providing sustained support to implement county-based action plans.

The 2025 CAP Implementation Grants include $9.5 million from the state Environmental Stewardship Fund and $6.2 million in federal funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), including $1.1 million in Local Government Implementation (LGI) Funds for project implementation in the Octoraro Watershed in Chester and Lancaster counties. The LGI projects will be reported to support pollution reduction goals under the multi-jurisdictional Conowingo Watershed Implementation Plan, which aims to reduces pollution entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Conowingo Dam reservoir.

Through an innovative new arrangement, the block grant funding model of the CAP Implementation Grant has enabled DEP’s Bureau of Clean Water to provide $100,000 of 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds to Mifflin County in support of restoration of the Town Run Watershed and $114,000 of federal Chesapeake Bay Implementation Grant funding through the Bureau of Watershed Restoration and Nonpoint Source Management for restoration efforts in the Hammer Creek Watershed. This is the first time the 604(b) Clean Water Act planning funds have been targeted through a partnership between DEP programs toward the Countywide Action Plans.

The electric vehicle sector, once hailed as the unstoppable force reshaping transportation, is facing its most significant headwinds yet in 2025. Global sales of battery-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have shown signs of deceleration, with particular weakness in key markets like North America. This shift comes amid economic pressures, policy changes, and intensifying competition from Chinese manufacturers. According to recent data, while overall global sales grew modestly by about 21% to 18.5 million units this year, the pace has slowed compared to previous explosive growth periods, driven largely by surges in Europe but offset by stagnation elsewhere.

In the United States, the removal of federal tax credits has dealt a severe blow to demand. Tesla, the longtime market leader, saw its U.S. sales plummet to a near four-year low in November, dropping roughly 23% year-over-year to around 39,800 vehicles. This decline persists despite the company’s efforts to introduce more affordable models. Broader industry figures paint a similar picture: North American EV sales are on track for their first annual drop since 2019, with growth decelerating sharply after subsidies were phased out.

Chinese giants like BYD, however, continue to dominate on a global scale. BYD overtook Tesla in battery-electric vehicle deliveries back in the fourth quarter of 2023 and has maintained its lead, capturing a 15.4% share of the global BEV market in the third quarter of 2025. This success stems from aggressive pricing, rapid model launches, and strong domestic performance, even as China’s overall market approaches saturation.

Shifting Dynamics in Major Markets

The divergence between regions highlights the uneven progress of EV adoption. In Europe, sales have surged, contributing significantly to the global uptick. Factors such as stringent emissions regulations and renewed incentives have propelled growth, with battery-electric vehicles leading over plug-in hybrids in the mix through the first nine months of 2025. Reports from Autovista24 detail how brands like Volkswagen and emerging players have capitalized on this momentum, pushing BEV registrations ahead.

Contrast this with the U.S., where the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit has chilled consumer interest. Industry analysts note that without these incentives, many potential buyers are opting for traditional hybrids or sticking with internal combustion engines. Tesla’s struggles are emblematic: despite rolling out cheaper variants of its Model 3 and Model Y, the company has failed to reverse the sales skid. Exclusive estimates shared with Reuters underscore this, showing November figures as the lowest since early 2022.

Meanwhile, China’s market, which accounts for over half of global EV sales, is showing signs of plateauing. BYD and peers like Geely Holdings have expanded aggressively, with BYD securing approvals for 38 new models in China this year alone, far outpacing Tesla’s three. Yet, even here, Tesla’s share in the new energy vehicle segment slipped to 2.03% in October, dropping it out of the top 10 for the first time in years, as per data from CnEVPost.

Competitive Pressures and Innovation Races

The rise of Chinese manufacturers isn’t just a domestic story; it’s reshaping international competition. BYD’s global market share in battery-electric vehicles stood at 15% in the third quarter of 2025, with Tesla trailing at 13%. This shift is evident in emerging markets like South America, where EV sales are booming without significant Tesla presence. A Reuters report highlights how importers in Peru and elsewhere are turning to affordable Chinese options, bypassing Tesla’s import hurdles.

Tesla’s challenges extend beyond pricing. CEO Elon Musk’s focus on robotics and other ventures has drawn criticism for diverting attention from core auto sales. A separate Reuters analysis points out that while Musk secured a massive pay package, vehicle deliveries have stagnated, with global sales projected to remain flat for the second consecutive year. In the U.S. and Europe, Tesla’s brand image has suffered, leading to declines of 5.7% and 10.7% respectively in 2024, trends that have persisted into 2025.

Innovation speed is another battleground. Chinese firms like BYD and Geely are launching models at a blistering pace, with Rest of World noting how they outstrip U.S. counterparts in regulatory approvals and market entry. This agility allows them to respond quickly to consumer preferences, such as demand for affordable crossovers and sedans, further eroding Tesla’s once-dominant position.

Policy Impacts and Consumer Sentiment

Government policies remain a critical driver—or deterrent—in EV adoption. The U.S. rollback of tax incentives has not only hurt Tesla but also broader players like Ford, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, whose sales dipped in April, marking a 5.6% year-over-year decline for new EVs. Posts on X from industry observers echo this, with sentiments indicating that the middle tier of the market is cracking under pressure, even as Tesla and General Motors show isolated bright spots.

In contrast, Europe’s supportive framework has fueled a 21% global sales jump, as detailed in a recent Electrek article. Yet, even there, Tesla’s sales are faltering, down 40-45% year-over-year in key months, while Chinese EVs surge. This regional disparity underscores how policy stability can make or break market momentum.

Consumer sentiment, influenced by economic factors like inflation and high interest rates, adds another layer. In North America, buyers are increasingly wary of EV range anxiety and charging infrastructure gaps, opting instead for hybrids that offer familiarity. X posts from analysts like Troy Teslike highlight Tesla’s brand challenges in the U.S. and Europe, predicting flat or declining sales unless addressed.

Forecasts and Future Trajectories

Looking ahead, projections from the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 suggest that while global adoption will continue, growth rates may moderate to single digits in mature markets. China’s dominance is expected to persist, with BYD and Geely Holdings projected to hold 15% and 10% shares respectively by year’s end, based on quarterly data from Counterpoint Research.

Tesla, facing these headwinds, is pivoting toward autonomy and robotaxis, but skeptics argue this distracts from immediate sales needs. BloombergNEF’s Electric Vehicle Outlook anticipates that shared mobility and autonomous tech could reinvigorate the sector, but only if integrated with affordable vehicles.

Emerging markets offer glimmers of hope. South America’s EV boom, driven by non-Tesla imports, signals untapped potential. However, without policy harmonization, global fragmentation could deepen, leaving North America further behind.

Strategic Responses from Industry Players

Automakers are adapting in varied ways. BYD’s strategy of flooding markets with diverse, low-cost models has paid off, as evidenced by its Q4 2023 overtake of Tesla in global deliveries, per a Statista chart. This approach contrasts with Tesla’s premium focus, which has alienated price-sensitive buyers.

U.S. firms like General Motors are finding success with targeted models, bucking the broader decline. Yet, the overall North American drop—projected as the first since 2019—prompts questions about long-term viability without renewed subsidies.

Chinese expansion into Europe and beyond intensifies pressure. Visual Capitalist’s analysis shows China’s makers widening their lead, with global reach cementing positions in 2025.

Broader Implications for the Auto Sector

The slowdown affects supply chains, from battery production to raw materials. Declining demand in the U.S. could ripple through lithium and cobalt markets, already volatile.

Investors are recalibrating expectations. Tesla’s stock has reflected these woes, with X discussions pointing to a 70% sales drop in some European countries and a 49% shipment decline in China, juxtaposed against BYD’s 161% growth.

Ultimately, the EV sector’s path forward hinges on balancing innovation, policy, and affordability. As Chinese players consolidate gains, Western firms must innovate or risk obsolescence.

Evolving Consumer Preferences and Market Realities

Shifting buyer priorities, such as a preference for vehicles with longer ranges and faster charging, are reshaping offerings. Hybrids are gaining as a bridge technology, eroding pure EV share in transitional markets.

Infrastructure buildout remains crucial. In the U.S., inadequate charging networks exacerbate hesitancy, while China’s dense setup supports higher adoption.

Global forecasts indicate EVs could reach 20-30% of new sales by 2030, but 2025’s slump serves as a cautionary tale of over-reliance on incentives.

Pathways to Recovery and Growth

Strategies for revival include cost reductions through scale. BYD’s vertical integration model offers lessons for others.

Collaborations, like potential U.S.-China joint ventures, could accelerate tech transfer, though geopolitical tensions loom.

In summary, while challenges abound, the underlying shift toward electrification endures, propelled by environmental imperatives and technological advances.

As I wrote on Friday: this is both a transition and an expansion. Several folks will be stepping up to use this platform and I couldn’t be more excited to hear what comes next.

A platform, now with more places to stand

Archimedes said: “Give me a place to stand and I will move the Earth.” This podcast will become a platform for more people to stand.

The podcast is moving into a multi-host format, and one of those new voices is Matt Boms, Executive Director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance (TAEBA). Matt has been a leader on some of the most important energy work in Texas: distributed energy resources, affordability, energy waste reduction, grid flexibility, and much more.

How I got “bit by the bug”

Matt asked how I got into energy. The real answer is, slowly and then all at once.

My early work in energy policy was at the Texas Legislature, in a stretch (2005 to 2009) when a lot was happening and the instincts to build and expand were strong.

That period mattered because it shaped a belief I still hold today: Texas works best when we put pragmatism above ideology. Texas is a place to build and do big things.

The next frontier is the grid edge

One of the big themes in this conversation with Matt is that the “cheap electrons” story is true on the generation side, but bills keep climbing because transmission and distribution costs keep rising.

So if we’re serious about affordability, we have to talk about the distribution grid, and the tools that can help us defer (or avoid) some of the costs associated with building out the grid. We’re still going to spend a lot but can we avoid some of it?

That’s where distributed energy resources (DERs) come in, and where Texas has a real opportunity to lead.

Matt and TAEBA recently looked at what DERs could do in Oncor’s territory. The numbers are big, but here’s the one that sticks: about $279 per family per year in savings. If you want a sense of how big a difference that would make for many Texans, check out my discussion with Margo Weisz of the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute:

There are two core value buckets behind these savings:

Wholesale market value (DERs competing through aggregation, the work ERCOT is already moving through)

Transmission and distribution deferral or avoidance (often the larger, currently under-valued piece)

If we get the policy design right, DERs can help lower system costs, enable load growth, and reduce the pressure that shows up on people’s bills.

Final Thoughts

If you’ve been listening for a while, let the new team (more announcements on that soon) know what topics you want them to cover next.

The next chapter is going to be great. I can’t wait to listen!

Doug Lewin (00:04.526)

Welcome back to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin. Today’s episode is a little different. The platform is expanding into a multi-host format. I’m really excited about these changes. I cannot wait to be a listener to this podcast and hear where it’s going. I’ve been working with your new hosts and there are several on the issues and topics and speakers they’re going to be inviting and I could not be more excited.

Doug Lewin (00:33.504)

about where this is gonna go. I put out a post this morning at the Texas Energy and Power newsletter called It’s a Transition and an Expansion. And that is exactly what it is. Change can be hard, but change can also be really good. And this is an opportunity for a lot of folks to use the platform that I have helped to build. There’s a famous quote from Archimedes where he says, give me a place to stand and I’ll move the earth.

Doug Lewin (01:03.768)

You all, dear listener, come on, it’s the Energy Capital podcast. Y’all, dear listeners, have given me a place to stand, given me a voice, and I’m deeply, deeply grateful for that. Now, other folks are gonna have this place to stand to move the Earth. Stand with them, help them through this transition and expansion, and I know you’re gonna be really excited to hear what comes next. So today, again, this is a little different.

Doug Lewin (01:31.2)

and thrilled to introduce one of the new voices who will be carrying this work forward. That’s Matt Bombs. Matt is the executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, TABAA for short. They do some great work in Texas and Matt has done some great work, particularly around distributed energy resources. He was part of that aggregated distributed energy resource task force that has had a lot of success in Texas. He’s also part of the advisory committee on the backup power package program I talk a lot about. He was instrumental

Doug Lewin (02:00.138)

in getting the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee established here in Texas. So he’s done a lot of great work. He is an expert in his own right. He is very interested and curious about all this stuff, just like I am. And I’m thrilled that he’s one of the people that is going to be stepping onto this platform. So what you’re here today is me interviewing Matt and Matt interviewing me. A little bit of a retrospective looking back. I hope you enjoy this episode and I hope you enjoy all the episodes going forward.

Doug Lewin (02:28.364)

I can’t wait to listen myself and I know you’re gonna like what comes next. So with that, thanks for listening and let’s jump in.

Matt Boms (02:43.352)

Hi everybody, I’m Matt Bombs and I’m here with Doug Lewin on the Energy Capital podcast. Doug, it’s great to have you here on the podcast that you built. And now that I’m hosting the podcast with a few of my very talented and brilliant colleagues, it’s just a great opportunity to pick your brain and to hear more from you. I really do want to hear more about your story and how you first got into energy. What was the key factor that really brought you into this industry and how did you first get started?

Doug Lewin (03:11.522)

Yeah, Matt, before I jump into that, just want to say how thrilled I am to be able to take this platform that I think really is reaching a lot of people that are really interested in Texas energy. Texas is such a dynamic place and you’re such an important part of that ecosystem. And I’m thrilled that you’re excited to step into this role, like you mentioned with some others. So, you know, we, often joke in the energy world about energy transition and energy expansion. This is both, it’s going to be an energy transition and an expansion.

Doug Lewin (03:41.154)

You know, with, new hosts coming in and there’ll be multiple of them that’ll allow more exploration. And I’m just so thrilled you’re in that mix. So thanks, Matt. So to answer your question, it’s something I’ve talked about a little bit on the pod over the years, but not a lot. And yeah, look, I can’t even like tell you like, Hey, there was this moment or this, you know, day or week or month or year where it would like all clicked and like, this is what, like what I want to do with my professional life. It kind of happened over time.

Matt Boms (03:49.59)

Awesome. Thanks so much Doug.

Doug Lewin (04:09.614)

Certainly some of my first experiences with energy policy were at the legislature. And it was a time at the legislature, there was a really good time to be there. It 2005 to 2009. It was just a very different time over there, particularly related to energy policy. So like a lot of things were happening, right? 2005 Senate bill 20, which had an expansion of global portfolio standard, the big expansion of the transmission system commonly known as CREZ, but really that enabled a lot of the economic growth Texas had over the last 20 years.

Doug Lewin (04:39.758)

You know, that was passed in 05, 07, there was a major efficiency bill that was passed then. I had the privilege to work on that. That was with Representative Strauss before he was Speaker Strauss. And then, you know, 2000, when 2008, right, people forget this, but you had both Republican and Democratic candidates running on platforms that were extremely pro clean energy, climate action, all that kind of stuff. And obviously 2009, you had...

Doug Lewin (05:05.166)

President Obama and there was like RF funds and all that kind of stuff. So like, it was just kind of a fascinating time to be in there. Add to that, that like 2005, six Al Gore puts out inconvenient truth and Rick Perry fast tracked 11 coal plants. Now Perry was like, you know, pro wind and solar and pro transmission and pro coal. He’s got to like pro everything, but you know, 11 coal plants, right in the middle of that context of like this dawning awareness around climate change. It was just kind of, it was just a fascinating time.

Doug Lewin (05:33.932)

to be in it and I’ve always found the energy space to be dynamic and fast paced and interesting. And it’s just one of those subject areas that almost any subject areas this way, if you get bit by the bug and you’re into it enough, right? That there’s no like end to learning in it. I always feel that beginner’s mind thing is there that like any corner you turn, it’s like, wow. I didn’t know about that whole thing. Tell me about that. Right. I want to, I want to read up and get smart on that and

Doug Lewin (06:03.406)

after 20 years of doing this, I still have the same feeling. And to your point and your question, like that’s even more so now, right? The acceleration is accelerating, right? So like what I thought has always been a pretty dynamic space, way more dynamic now. And the amount of stuff that we all have to learn just to keep up, right? Not even get ahead, but just keep falling off the back of the treadmill. It’s, there’s so much right now. And I find that challenge of not just keeping up, but like,

Doug Lewin (06:32.962)

that challenge of really comprehending what’s going on, really seeing different stakeholders point of view and how do different entities view this very same problem so differently. So there’s this whole kind of social dimension to the work that I absolutely love as well. yeah, I can’t really like pinpoint a day or a year or something like that. It was just like the ledge through to be in the head of an energy efficiency organization to go into clear result. Everything throughout my career has just added to it and just sort of like.

Doug Lewin (07:01.398)

increased that passion every step along the way.

Matt Boms (07:04.866)

That’s really interesting, Doug, and I am really interested in hearing more about how things got more political. So you started in this role, you were working in the energy industry at a time where these different technologies were all emerging. And at a certain point, the technology itself began being painted as red or blue or whatever color of your choice. And I want to hear more about the politicization.

Matt Boms (07:29.718)

even leading up to Winter Storm Yuri, about how did that change happen and what was it like as someone who was actively working in the industry at that time?

Doug Lewin (07:36.61)

I

Doug Lewin (07:36.71)

think the politicization of energy, you know, is thankfully not as bad as in a lot of other areas, but it has at least tracked, if not equally, but sort of tracked the polarization that is happening in the countries and all. I’ll tell you, one of the, I’m proud of all the podcasts that I’ve done with Energy Capital Podcasts. And I’m going to be proud to hear all the ones you’re going to do. I’m so looking forward to being a listener going forward, but.

Doug Lewin (08:02.646)

You know, one of the ones I’m most proud of was with David Spence and it was about, you know, his book, brilliant book, Climate of Contempt, which sort of was the whole thing is about the polarization of climate policy. And I’ll say, I think that’s actually probably how it became so polarized was like climate change has become very polarized. The things that you wouldn’t have imagined 20 years ago could have become that polarized. know, McCain and Obama both running on doing something about climate change.

Doug Lewin (08:31.608)

Who would have thought like vaccinations would have become as politically polarized as they are. But I will say, I think this is an issue area where you see really, really interesting alliances, left, right, center. And I think it’s because if you can kind of step back and kind of focus on first principles, we all want a reliable and affordable and clean grid. Like I don’t care what your political ideology is. You don’t like air pollution. Like nobody wants to have polluted.

Doug Lewin (09:00.394)

skies and water. Like that’s not something somebody sets out to do. I think in this industry, people are actually pretty mature about understanding that there are trade-offs and that those trade-offs are quite real. And so I think as much as possible, Matt, what I have tried to do, and I hope you’ll continue to do this on this platform, is to dial down that temperature, to have discussions with...

Doug Lewin (09:26.996)

The first question of asking somebody to come on the podcast isn’t what political tribe are you a part of? It’s do you have interesting thoughts on energy? They may not be the same as my thoughts on energy. I actually hope they aren’t because if we’re only talking to people we agree with 100%, like what’s the point? I mean, you know, some of it is to explore differences. Some of it is just to learn from experts that know, you know, that’s been my great joy in doing this is having people on that know so much more than me that I can ask questions of.

Doug Lewin (09:57.014)

and get smarter and help the audience get smarter too. And I’ll tell you, I mean, I’m just so excited about some of the possibilities of, you know, cross ideological cross partisan. And I don’t even want to just say bipartisan. Like it could be all kinds of different beliefs that if you come to this from, want cheap, fast, reliable, clean power. Like

Doug Lewin (10:22.764)

Let’s talk about what are the things we can do to get all those. know, competition, right? That’s one of those places that like, you know, you get broad agreement in general, not a hundred percent, but broad agreement left and right that like competition is generally a good thing, particularly on the right, which has made things like really, really interesting in Texas. So I think as much as possible to depoliticize it, to dial the temperature down, to look for areas of commonality, you know, it’s interesting.

Doug Lewin (10:52.29)

Chairman Flores of ERCOT gave a speech at, I think it was at Gulf Coast Power Association where he talked about like, can we look for our similarities first and our differences next? And I just think that’s so powerful. And I’ve always tried to do that in my career, like connect with somebody first and then explore the differences. I think too many people are just leading with their differences. And like that’s on a human level makes it very hard to work with anybody.

Matt Boms (11:18.286)

Yeah, I completely agree with you. And that is not limited to energy, right? We’re seeing that across our entire society. And I think you said at the outset that speaks to kind of your curiosity as a person, but the fact that you’re not married to your ideas, right? Things change. We’re constantly learning. A lot of these concepts are new and emerging. AI is only beginning to emerge as this new pillar of society. We’re all going to have a lot to learn here.

Matt Boms (11:46.508)

moving forward. I think that at the outset, if we can just drop our prior set of expectations and maybe any biases that we have, that will help us all come together and work in a more productive way. And I certainly think that what you mentioned about competitive markets being, know, historically Republican principle in a Republican state, that was probably the single biggest factor in the renewable industry having success in Texas and continues to be right. So that will be

Matt Boms (12:16.334)

crucial moving forward. And I think that’s what’s bringing a lot of solar, wind and battery companies to Texas because of the competitive market that we have here. You don’t see that in other states. see even blue states having trouble with the renewable build out because of permitting problems or because of regulatory issues that they’re facing, because of the backlogs and interconnection that they have. And as a state, we’ve been able to leapfrog a lot of those problems. And there’s a whole bunch of reasons behind that that you can take us through.

Matt Boms (12:45.486)

But I think overall you’re right that the taking the ideology out of it and maybe focusing less on politics and more on practical solutions is probably how we’re going to move forward here and meet the load growth that’s coming. So that’s what I want to hear from you too is how are we going to possibly, some of the numbers are mind blowing. You’ve gone through this in previous podcast episodes. How do you see us meeting this next big challenge and this big tsunami of load growth that’s coming?

Doug Lewin (13:10.092)

Yeah. Well, first, before I get to that, I just want to back up to something you said just a minute ago, right? So like competition, yes, Texas has been a red state for a long time. When Senate Bill seven was passed, the house was still democratic. So it was a very bipartisan bill. Senate was Republican. Governor was Republican. House was democratic. And they had to find those solutions across, know, bicameral, bipartisan. And competition had strong support in the democratic house with Speaker

Doug Lewin (13:39.182)

Pete Laney, if I’ve got this right, and I think I do, it’s within a couple of votes, but I think it was 146 out of 150 voted for Senate Bill 7. So like, and again, I came into the legislature like a few years after that, and I think we’ve seen, there’s still a lot of bills that get that many votes, but not as many big bills. And that’s what I would hope we can start to get to is as a state, if we say these are the things we prioritize, right? Again, clean, cheap, fast, reliable, like,

Doug Lewin (14:08.81)

What are the things that kind of meet all of those things or most of those things? And how do we balance those using competitive market forces? And I’ll tell you, as far as the load growth goes, it’s really amazing. There was a study that Aurora did for ERCOT on the Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service. There were a lot of different models they ran and there’s a lot of different results that came out. There was only one result.

Doug Lewin (14:34.776)

that had 0.0 gigawatts worth of load shed in a winter storm Elliott, which was the 2022 winter storm in December, right before Christmas or 2023 heat wave. There’s only one that had zero rolling outages. And that was the very high data center load growth scenario. That was the only one like, you know, you could spend all this money and build new ancillary services and capacity markets, capacity constructs, all that kind of stuff. And you would still have.

Doug Lewin (15:05.022)

some outages. The one exception was the high load growth. And what they were modeling was if we had high load growth and data centers are bringing their own generation and 60 % of them have flexibility in them, that would get you down to 0.0. So I think, again, no matter what your political persuasion is, the investment that could be coming to the state, the potential to actually get the most reliable grid possible, right?

Doug Lewin (15:34.398)

while spreading the fixed cost of the system out to more users. Like all of this is there right in front of us. And I couldn’t be more excited to continue to be working in Texas towards this vision of a clean, reliable, affordable, you know, power grid, which we’ve made huge strides over the last five years in this state. There’s just no denying it. We got a long way to go. And pretty soon here, we’re going to flip the mic around. I’m going to ask you questions, Matt, because I know you over the last several years.

Doug Lewin (16:01.986)

have been working on some of the very things that I think are like most essential to get to that clean, reliable, affordable grid. So yeah, we’ll do that in a second, but I don’t know. I don’t want to cut you off. had any other like burning questions you want to ask.

Matt Boms (16:16.716)

Well, yeah, what changes now, because for most of your career, you know, correct me if I’m wrong, we didn’t have the kind of low growth that we have now, right? So that’s right. That’s a huge, drastic change from how energy has functioned over the last few decades, right? So where do we go from here? Like, where do you see policymakers really changing their views and making sure that we’re bringing these businesses to Texas instead of turning them away because we don’t have enough power?

Doug Lewin (16:47.202)

Yeah, look, to me, there’s so much, right? This is so complicated. Obviously, there’s a long record there for people to go back and listen to, hearing all this stuff. But to me, this kind of boils down to three main things, right? You’ve gotta keep the conditions for new supply to want to come to Texas. We have built more supply here than any other state by far. It’s not close.

Doug Lewin (17:11.406)

And that’s because of the competitive market design. So I think being protective of that competitive market design, keeping those price signals, you know, at the ERCOT board meeting, there’s some discussion around, not getting enough gas built. The gas queue has tripled in the last 18 months because those signals are coming from the new demand, right? So I think keeping that where particularly solar storage and gas, like those are the things that are going to be built over the next years. Wind too, there’ll be some wind in the mix, but.

Doug Lewin (17:40.194)

you know, probably not as much as the other three. Transmission, to be able to move all that power around and to be doing it in a way that is not, it’s not always congested, driving up costs, causing reliability problems. Congestion is not just a cost issue. It’s a reliability problem too. If you’ve got generation in a part of the state and you can’t move it to where it’s needed, you got reliability problems, right? We’ve had that South of San Antonio the last several years and we got it, we got to get ahead of that.

Doug Lewin (18:06.702)

And think ERCOT’s work on building out a 765 system, we’re recording on a day when the ERCOT board approved the building of the Eastern half of the 765 system. So that I think is really key. And then the last one, and this is probably a good segue to flip this around. And let me start asking you some questions, is the demand side. And I know you, Matt, you’ve played a huge leadership role in Texas on demand side.

Doug Lewin (18:30.686)

Demand side to me, look, I’ve spent a big part of my career working on energy efficiency and DERs, VPPs before anybody knew what a VPP was. Well, a few people knew, but it wasn’t as talked about as it is now, right? And I think that for a long time, the perception was, those are interesting and nice. Sure, who’s supposed to saving some energy and getting lower bills? Those are nice, but it was always just kind of like, there’s a little pat on the head, great work.

Doug Lewin (19:00.334)

cool, but that’s not the real stuff. In this environment with rapid load growth, those demand side solutions become absolutely essential and central. There’s a big discussion going on right now in the Twitterverse around this. Matt Iglesias had an article out, which I haven’t read yet, so I probably shouldn’t talk about it. I’ve only seen his tweets. So I will go read the article, Matt Iglesias, and digest your whole argument. But what I can gather from the Twitter spats is like,

Doug Lewin (19:29.548)

there is this kind of debate going on of like, is it more supply or demand side stuff? we be like demand flexibility and energy efficiency just aren’t going to be enough to meet our needs. We need to build more supply. And it’s like, well, of course, like, but, that’s not a binary. You don’t have to choose one or the other of those things. And, and as a matter of fact, if you choose one or other of those things, you’re probably going to end up short. We’re going to need resources everywhere we can get them. And that includes demand side resources and supply side resources.

Doug Lewin (19:59.616)

I just think that is a false choice if ever there was one. So I really think building up energy efficiency, distributed energy resources. So if you’re okay, Matt, I’m start asking you questions. Is that all right?

Matt Boms (20:12.856)

Yeah, I think you just did ask me like five questions.

Doug Lewin (20:14.958)

Doug Lewin (20:15.359)

So talk to us about distributed energy resources and energy efficiency. Tell us a little about your work in that area and what kind of excites you about that, what you’re excited to be working on.

Matt Boms (20:26.36)

Yeah, well, I think the way I like to think about this is electricity is the backbone of our economy, right? Like I went to school, I studied economics and the feeling that I have is the electric grid is the backbone for local economic development. There are other countries that don’t have the luxury that we have in the United States of having an abundant electric grid. And there are countries where businesses simply can’t operate because they don’t have a stable grid.

Matt Boms (20:55.33)

to count on like we do here. They also don’t have cheap electricity, right, which is something that we take for granted, just generally speaking, right? We have some variations across states, across counties, but for the most part, Americans have access to reliable, affordable electricity. And those are the key words that we want to keep it affordable. We want to keep it reliable. And that’s, think, the challenge that we’re going to be facing now with all the new data centers that are coming to Texas. So I think my feeling on this, Doug, is also that it’s not black and white. It’s not one or the other.

Matt Boms (21:25.292)

You can make the same argument that I just heard you make when it comes to different technologies, whether it’s solar, batteries, gas, wind, DERs, energy waste, transmission infrastructure. We need all of that. It’s not going to be choosing winners and losers. It’s going to be all of these different technologies playing their role in meeting our energy needs moving forward. Yep. So the key piece for me is how do we keep it flexible?

Matt Boms (21:51.466)

And I think the flexibility is what’s going to drive affordability and reliability in Texas. I don’t think that we’re at a point now in ERCOT where we can say our grid is sufficiently flexible to meet all of the load that’s coming. I think we have a lot of work to do. I think you can see that through price volatility. You can see that in parts of the state where during heat wave or a winter storm, the price signals are exorbitantly high and

Matt Boms (22:19.852)

distributed resources aren’t being valued the way that they should, right? There’s no reason we shouldn’t be valuing battery storage or backup generators or smart thermostats for the value that they’re bringing on those days that we really need them. And that might only be 1 % of the year, but when we really do need to count on them, that’s where we’re going to have to think of ways to support those technologies. And by doing that, you’re going to bring the costs down for consumers, right? Because right now it certainly feels like

Matt Boms (22:49.282)

For anyone that owns a home in Texas that has looked into rooftop solar or batteries, the prices are still too high. They’re just not affordable enough. And I think that’s where the policy comes in because the policy creates the market that we need to set up for distributed resources.

Doug Lewin (23:05.25)

Yeah, I was just going to say like that is, you when you talk about yes, like power is more reliable here, or more, I should say more affordable, more reliable too. But your point was it’s more affordable here than is a lot of places in the world. A lot of places you just can’t get electricity. Important to acknowledge, and I know you do acknowledge this, you just started to talk about it there, that like for a lot of people, power is, is unaffordable, right? We have a, we have a large portion of the population.

Doug Lewin (23:30.808)

that is really struggling to pay their bills, 30 to 40 % that are making choices between paying their power bills, paying for food and medicine. So this is really where I think it becomes really important when you’re talking about flexibility, if we can bring those flexible resources, whether they be batteries or demand response, right, through thermostats, heat pumps that are connected to a thermostat and have variable speed, all of those kinds of things.

Doug Lewin (23:58.434)

that you can meet, just like you said, Matt, that 1 % of the year, maybe it’s 2 % some years if there’s a really bad heat wave, but you’re talking about, you know, a few hundred hours, right, during a winter storm, right, having those batteries that are on the distributed network. And a lot of people say the batteries only last for one or two hours. If you’ve got a battery in your garage, it could be configured to last a lot longer than an hour or two. This is a common perception I think we’ve really got to get after, that every battery is only a one or two hour battery. Not true.

Doug Lewin (24:27.958)

It depends how it’s configured and we can stretch them out and have all kinds of different configurations to them. And if we can do that, not only does that bring the price of generation down, that means in some cases we won’t have to do as extensive a build out of the distribution grid, right? Which is the biggest driver of higher energy bills right now is on the distribution grid. So I know

Doug Lewin (24:53.422)

You and the organization, Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, put out a study recently looking at the encore service territory and what DERs could mean for that. I think the number was something like eight and a half billion in savings over 10 years. Tell us a little about the findings and how could we actually get to those savings? What policy solutions might unlock some of those savings for consumers?

Matt Boms (25:16.43)

Sure, yeah, the calculation was around $2,000 in savings per rate payer over the next 10 years. And that’s a huge amount of savings for, like you said, folks that are struggling to pay their energy bills that really could use that relief, right? And might not necessarily have the capital to go out right now and buy a huge solar and battery system to install on their house. Or for a small business that frankly we’ve seen in Houston.

Matt Boms (25:45.272)

small businesses that after Hurricane Barrel went out and purchased backup generators because they can’t just accept a week without a business because a hurricane swept in and wiped out their power, right? And to your point, there are plenty of stories after Barrel of folks that did weather the storm through battery systems and through rooftop solar. So I think we have the arguments and we have the case studies to show that the technologies are working. You asked about what are the policies that could be put in place to solve the problem.

Matt Boms (26:15.054)

The way that the number was calculated as far as the roughly $2,000 per rate payer is on the one hand, you have the wholesale market value, right? So you have, if these technologies could compete in the wholesale market, how much potentially could we assign in value to those distributed resources? And that’s happening through the aggregated DER project, right? There’s a lot of work that needs to be done there, but it’s working its way through ERCOT.

Matt Boms (26:40.77)

The other half that is not at all being valued right now is through the transmission and distribution deferral, right? So for every distributed resource that’s put on the grid, you are ultimately deferring transmission and distribution that needs to be built out in the long-term, right? So that means an overloaded substation that might need to be replaced, but can you replace that with batteries or with whatever distributed technology works best for that particular location in Texas, right?

Matt Boms (27:10.614)

Right now we have a system set up where we are just building out poles and wires through our transmission and distribution utilities and we’re not assigning any value to DERs when they can be a more cost effective technology for rate payers. Because ultimately we’re trying to save money for rate payers through these technologies. So that’s where most of the value comes from, Doug. I know that you had Astrid Atkinson on your podcast recently who spoke about

Matt Boms (27:37.794)

The fact that it can be up to 75 % of the value of distributed resources could be attributed to that TND deferral, right? That’s the big piece here that we’re missing within the ERCOT system because that whole part of the value stack is missing currently in the way that our market is set up.

Doug Lewin (27:53.998)

Yeah, and the podcasts with Charles Hua, with Margo Weiss, like, you know, we see that the lines for generation have been relatively flat to some years down. Every once in a while you get a little blip like 2022 with the Russian invasion where like generation goes up. But generally, overtime cost of generation going down for two reasons. And when we talking about the competitive market earlier and you said, you know, it’s brought a lot of renewables, it also brought a ton of gas, right? Especially in the mid-aughts, right? Really cheap gas.

Doug Lewin (28:22.35)

cheap renewables have lowered the cost generation. Meanwhile, the lines for transmission and distribution are going up. Now I said earlier, I really do believe we need the 765 build out. It’s really important to be able to move power around more efficiently. Large amounts of power, those lines can carry four to six times the amount of the next voltage down. So we’ve really got to look to that distribution grid. And that’s really what I think this study is a really good one. We talked about it a little bit, I hope.

Doug Lewin (28:47.862)

Matt, you might be able to have Demand Site Analytics that did that excellent study. And I understand you guys are doing another one that is ERCOT wide that’ll come out at some point. So maybe that’ll be a good interview for you on the podcast going forward is really getting into that study and breaking down some of the assumptions there and how could those savings go bigger? How would they be smaller? What kinds of policies do we actually need to unlock those savings, right?

Matt Boms (29:10.584)

Yeah, that’s right. I also think this is an area where Texas could lead the country, right? Like it really is the new frontier. If you think about all the data centers that are being built and how they can contribute to that flexibility in Texas, that’s a huge opportunity. Like that’s the way we can unlock all of this load growth and the business opportunity in Texas, because all of a sudden you’re talking about dozens of gigawatts that are going to be coming online over the next few years.

Matt Boms (29:38.162)

And you have the capital to make it happen. You’ve got data centers that really the number one priority is how fast can I get power, right? It’s not about the capital that they have on hand. It’s about the speed that they can possibly get connected to our grid. So there’s an incentive there for making the grid more flexible and that enables more data center interconnection. So I’m hopeful that this will happen. I just think that we need to change the way we think about electricity, right? For those of us that have worked in this industry, we’re used to thinking about

Matt Boms (30:06.85)

the utilities delivering electrons to our homes and businesses. And something that is true, and like you said, we need those 765 lines to bring us cheap electrons from rural parts of the state. However, we also need to flip that on the table and say, well, these technologies weren’t around when the system was created, right? And so now all of sudden you have this great battery storage technology that can enable folks to generate their own power, right? And they should be rewarded for bringing flexibility to the grid.

Doug Lewin (30:34.862)

And you know what’s a great way to get like new resources onto the grid competition and markets. I actually got chills, Matt, when you said Texas could lead this, cause that has been a huge theme on this podcast, right? For years. And I’m so happy that you’re like grabbing the torch and going to keep that going forward. Cause that really is a theme here is Texas has a lot going for it. We have the elements here to put all that together. And I think you’ve got that vision.

Doug Lewin (31:04.66)

You can see that. You can kind of see that you got a puzzle in front of you. All the pieces are there. We’ve got the competitive market. You know, that means we’ve got competitive retail electric providers. We’ve got very innovative co-ops and munis as well. There’s a ton. I hope you’ll do some podcasts with, especially some of the co-ops. think I only did, I think it was only Bandera. Was that the only co-op? So like that’s kind of a big, big hole in this podcast that needs to be filled. There’s a lot going on at co-ops right now.

Doug Lewin (31:33.696)

in the competitive market, et cetera, Texas really has all those pieces to put together markets that send a price signal to these distributed resources to lower that distribution spending, bend the curve downward. And while we’re doing that, put those resources on people’s premises so that they have reliable and resilient service, even through those storms. Before we end, I just want to ask you just one more thing. And again, we’re teeing up like a bunch of different

Doug Lewin (32:03.768)

podcast episodes. hope the audience is getting a sense here, right? Dear listener that like there is no shortage of stuff to cover. There’s no shortage of people to cover it. I’m so excited to become a listener and hear where all this is going. But you’ve been working a lot on this Texas backup power package program, right? So this is this very innovative. think it instantly talk about Texas being a leader. Here’s Texas actually putting $1.8 billion towards

Doug Lewin (32:30.934)

Effectively microgrids, they may or may not actually be microgrids depending on how they’re configured, but effectively microgrids backup power systems at critical facilities like police stations and nursing homes, water treatment facilities, et cetera. You’ve been involved in that from the very beginning. Can you just share with the audience a little bit kind of a little bit more about what that is and why that’s exciting, why that’s been a priority for you over the last few years to work on and you know.

Doug Lewin (32:57.026)

what you might explore here on the podcast related to that really innovative program Texas has.

Matt Boms (33:02.062)

If we go back to the 2023 legislative session, this was part of SB 2627 that initially set up the Texas Energy Fund. think when folks hear Texas Energy Fund, they think of gas plants, That just automatically where our mind goes. But I constantly remind people that there’s the 1.8 billion allocated to the Backup Power Program, right? Of the 10 billion, 1.8 is for Backup Power. And so there’s a significant amount of resources that the state has allocated to this program.

Matt Boms (33:31.552)

I was surprised when it was first created that this hadn’t been done since Winter Storm URI. Like that was something that really stood out to me because you would hope that by now we would have backed up critical facilities. And I think it’s our obligation as people who work in this industry to make sure that hospitals, police, fire stations, nursing homes have power. If God forbid we have another Winter Storm URI event, we want to make sure that we’re taking care of.

Matt Boms (33:58.178)

our most vulnerable Texans, right? That’s something that we can all agree on. That’s not a partisan issue at all, right? We all want to protect vulnerable people in our state. So that was the impetus for the program. And I give a lot of credit to Alison Silverstein, who really put her blood, sweat, and tears into this program. And it’s something that we continue to work on with the Public Utility Commission. So I think the hope is that this will be launched next year.

Matt Boms (34:21.698)

This will be a program that ideally will bring in all the different vendors that are already manufacturing these technologies. It has to be a combination of solar, battery, and generator, right? It has to have those three. As an alternative, it could be electric school buses because those are essentially batteries on wheels, right? So those could be, if the load is small enough at some of these facilities, the electric school bus could absolutely power the facility for 48 continuous hours, which is what the statute says.

Matt Boms (34:50.082)

So I think what I’m looking forward to is the rollout of the program. I’m looking forward to bringing in private sector companies that are excited to roll up their sleeves and get these technologies out to rural communities across the state. And I think we also have to think about bringing in the critical facilities, making sure that they’re aware of this program, because, you know, it’s like when a tree falls in a forest kind of deal with if the critical facilities aren’t paying attention to this program, then they won’t know it exists. So I think we also have to support the program by bringing in all the different stakeholders and making sure that.

Matt Boms (35:20.12)

they’re aware that the program is here to support them. then hopefully next time a winter event or a summer event happens, these backup power packages will be in place to provide reliable power for those facilities.

Doug Lewin (35:33.902)

It’s such, such an important program. It’s such an important policy. And by the way, an example of where, you know, you had good bipartisan bicameral policy making happening. Like those are major policy decisions that take a lot of different input from a lot of different folks and kudos to the ledge for figuring that out. Now the PC is working to implement that and you’ll continue to cover that here. know that the backup power packages will be something also that could be talked about.

Doug Lewin (36:01.262)

at the Texas Energy Waste Advisory Committee, which you helped to get going. So we won’t talk about that one right now, but I’m just trying to tee up a lot of the different things that I know you’re gonna be talking about in the coming months. And I hope the audience is as excited as I am to get some different voices in here, explore some different topics that maybe I didn’t cover as much. And I just couldn’t be more excited about this next chapter. Matt, since we were interviewing each other, the question I always ask at the end, as you know,

Doug Lewin (36:29.704)

Is there anything I forgot to ask you? want to say anything you want to add? And then guess you can ask it back of me, but I’ll add, I don’t have anything to add. I’m good. Anything you want to add, Matt.

Matt Boms (36:39.15)

Driving away from the solar shed, Teichert and Thornock said their history with Rocky Mountain Power contradicts other utilities’ arguments against net-metering.
Less than two percent of all Wyoming homes have rooftop solar panels, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industry Association.","COKEVILLE, Wyo.—Tim Teichert and Jason Thornock want the sun to help them survive as ranchers in Cokeville, Wyoming. On an overcast May day, the two drove around the one-restaurant town, lamenting high electricity prices and restrictive Wyoming laws that they say have thrown an unnecessary burden onto their broad shoulders.

“I pay $90,000 in an electric bill,” Teichert said as he and Thornock made their way through fields of cattle, alfalfa and hay. “Jason’s about $150,000. If Jason had that $150,000 back, his kids could all come back to Cokeville, and work and live here, and you’d be able to raise kids here in Cokeville.”

In 2023, hoping to improve their margins, Teichert and Thornock each applied for Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grants, which the Biden administration had infused with $2 billion to help support farmers interested in renewable energy.

While neither man was thrilled about the prospect of applying for federal funds—they prefer smaller government—they were interested in using solar to cover their own electrical demand. Teichert and Thornock say this could have saved them five or six figures annually, and made their businesses more attractive to their kids.

Across Wyoming and the U.S., Americans increasingly face skyrocketing electricity bills. In 2023, Rocky Mountain Power, Teichert and Thornock’s utility and the largest in Wyoming, asked regulators at the state’s Public Service Commission to approve a nearly 30 percent rate increase; the next year, they asked to raise rates by close to 15 percent. Though both requests were ultimately granted at lower rates, affordability concerns have sent almost every corner of Wyoming scrambling for ways to defray rising electricity costs.

A fraction of homeowners already do this in the Equality State by using credits from their utility for generating their own electricity using solar panels and sending excess amounts back to the grid, an arrangement known as net metering. But Wyoming law caps net-metering systems at 25 kilowatts, large enough to include just about any homeowner’s rooftop solar system, but too small to provide enough credits to offset all the electricity larger properties, like ranches, draw from the grid.

Earlier this year, a coalition of environmentalists, businesses and ranchers, including Teichert and Thornock, unsuccessfully supported a bill that would have raised Wyoming’s net-metering cap to 250 kilowatts.

Teichert and Thornock were initially counting on changes to the law as they eyed REAP funds. Teichert, a sturdy man with pale blue eyes and a trim Fu Manchu mustache, eventually applied and was awarded a $440,000 grant to build a ranch shed supporting around 250 kilowatts of solar panels. Today, with no ability to net meter, he fears he may never recoup his investment, which was over $500,000. Thornock, whose wide, boyish grin sits atop a hefty build, was approved for $868,000 in REAP funding to build a 648-kilowatt solar system. Concerned that his project’s viability rested on the judgment of state lawmakers, he returned the money.

The Department of Agriculture has since stopped funding renewable energy projects on farmland. REAP was a “huge opportunity we all missed in Wyoming,” Thornock said.

The two men are not the only Wyoming ranchers interested in using solar to give their businesses more stability.

“A lot of ranchers really look to renewables to help diversify their revenue stream, keep the ranch whole, and keep their family on the ranch, keep the land together,” said Chris Brown, executive director of Powering Up Wyoming, a renewable energy advocacy group. Most of the ranchers he’s worked with are interested in leasing their lands to solar developers, rather than purchasing their own systems, and his organization is neutral on net-metering.

Rocky Mountain Power says it is open to changes in the state’s net-metering laws, and the utility did not take a position on net metering during last spring’s legislative session.

“It’s not a level playing field; you’re dealing with a monopoly—a government-subsidized monopoly, government-protected monopoly.”

— Jason Thornock

“We have worked diligently in recent decades with customers, municipalities, state legislatures, in order to facilitate particular regulatory and pricing changes to allow customers to meet their energy goals,” said David Eskelsen, a spokesperson for PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company and a subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.

If rate hikes keep coming and margins don’t improve, Teichert, who runs his ranch with his brother, fears he and Thornock will eventually have to sell their lands, which crisscross much of Cokeville. They find other utilities’ arguments against net-metering expansion dubious, and fume at the business model and regulatory environment that allows utilities to earn enormous profits but restricts their customers from making their own energy use more affordable. The two ranchers find it particularly ironic that Rocky Mountain Power could build power lines across their property to carry renewable energy to California, Oregon and Washington, while it is illegal for them to install enough solar panels to cover their own electrical bills.

“It’s not a level playing field; you’re dealing with a monopoly—a government-subsidized monopoly, government-protected monopoly,” Thornock said on his ride to see Teichert’s solar array. “It’s got all the power in the world. And, like Tim says, they want to sell renewable energy to California, [Washington] and Oregon. They won’t let us do it because they want the control.”

Reaping Few Rewards

Teichert pulled his truck through a gate and into a field of alfalfa and hay. Just beyond was a shed with 18 red steel legs that looked like an enormous centipede straddling bales of hay and some farming equipment. On top of the shed sat Teichert’s $1.1 million solar system, which was designed to cover the electrical costs of running all his irrigation system’s pivots and pumps.

If Teichert could net meter, he says he would be more competitive with ranchers just a few miles away in Idaho and Utah, where net-metering laws are much less restrictive than in Wyoming.

In Idaho, ranchers can install up to 100 kilowatts of solar, and that number jumps to 2 megawatts for ranchers in Utah, 80 times the limit in Wyoming.

Rocky Mountain Power charges irrigators different base electricity rates in each state, but regardless of the price of the power, any savings are helpful to big users like agricultural operations.

“Quite a few of the farmers [in Idaho and Utah] do it,” said Teichert, of net-metered solar.

In 2023, while Teichert was designing his system, Thornock was considering whether it was wise to spend his money on a solar array. He believed there was a good chance Wyoming wouldn’t change its law to increase the cap on net metering. Since his system would be more than 25 times the size that’s allowed to net meter, Thornock anticipated it would be extremely difficult for it to pay for itself if he wasn’t credited for sending excess electricity to the grid. He backed out of his REAP grant, and advised Teichert to do the same.

But Teichert forged ahead and installed his panels, believing it would be no big deal to convince Wyoming lawmakers to adjust the state’s net-metering law—especially given the more advantageous arrangement ranchers in Idaho and Utah enjoy with the same utility. “I thought I’d be ahead of everybody,” he said.

Once the bill to raise Wyoming’s net-metering cap failed, Teichert pivoted. He began exploring a power purchase agreement with Rocky Mountain Power, in which the utility would buy electricity from him like he was a power plant. He said he had been told by the company installing his panels that a power purchase agreement could net him a good deal.

But when he saw how much the utility would pay him, he laughed. The utility would give him less than 1 cent per kilowatt hour in winter periods of low demand, and about 4 cents in peak summer demand hours. He would get much more of a financial benefit from the electricity he sent to the grid if he was instead compensated through net metering, which Wyoming law typically requires be credited at Rocky Mountain Power’s retail rate of electricity. The utility charges him around 14 cents per kilowatt hour, he said.

Setting up to sell his excess electricity to the grid through a power purchase agreement could leave Teichert even deeper in the hole, he added, as the utility informed him it would need $43,000 just to look at connecting his system to its grid.

Originally, Teichert expected to pay off his solar shed in 10 years, but with the additional costs and the rates the utility offered, “I don’t know that I’ll ever come out on the deal,” he said.

And now, the federal support that incentivized him to pursue solar has been eliminated; in August the Department of Agriculture announced it would no longer fund solar or wind projects through REAP.

Teichert eventually decided to purchase a battery system to back up his panels. He does not plan on selling any of his electricity to Rocky Mountain Power.

“I should have listened to Jason,” he said.

Thornock feels he dodged a bullet.

Driving away from the solar shed, Teichert and Thornock said their history with Rocky Mountain Power contradicts other utilities’ arguments against net-metering.

Lines in the Valley

The biggest of the power lines crisscrossing the valley where Teichert and Thornock ranch belong to PacifiCorp, whose planned Gateway West project to deliver renewable energy to customers in California, Oregon and Washington would add even more lines. Some of those new lines could cross Teichert and Thornock’s properties, the men say.

They’ve got more experience with power lines than most utility customers, as they actually built some of the smaller lines coming off Rocky Mountain Power’s system.

Both men say the utility sent inflated estimates of the cost to install new lines to bring additional power to their growing ranching operations, leading them to seek help elsewhere.

In 2020, Teichert said he contracted a company to put in a power line for about $600,000 after the utility told him he would need to pay over $1 million for the same job, he said. Thornock has repeatedly testified to state lawmakers that Rocky Mountain Power nearly bankrupted him when he first began ranching in the late 2000s after going back and forth with him about whether they would deliver power on lines he had installed. Thornock wound up in court and lost, then had to cover the utility’s attorney fees.

The whole saga “was that close to breaking me,” he said, as Teichert drove by the poles he had installed.

Utilities warn that net-metering systems can allow those with rooftop solar to avoid paying fixed expenses for the grid they feed into, like system maintenance and construction costs, which, according to reporting by the New York Times, account for a growing share of utilities’ spending. “That in effect sets up a subsidy flowing from customers who don’t use net-metering systems to those who do,” said Eskelsen, PacifiCorp’s spokesperson. Any price issues rooftop solar customers cause are confined within their “rate class” of customers who use a similar amount of electricity, he added.

Determining how—or whether—to alter the rates for net-metering customers to make sure they’re paying their fair share for the infrastructure that takes their excess energy has been a sticking point between utilities and Wyoming’s net-metering supporters. Rooftop solar supporters say that subsidization likely occurs all over the grid regardless of whether a homeowner or business is net metering, and claim that avoiding transmission costs saves all ratepayers money.

Experts generally say that rooftop solar’s dependence on infrastructure that it isn’t paying for won’t create billing issues until 10 to 20 percent of a utility’s customer base is in the program. Less than two percent of all Wyoming homes have rooftop solar panels, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industry Association.

Given all the work he’s paid for, Teichert finds utilities’ arguments about cost sharing disingenuous. “When they sit there and say, ‘Well, we’re not paying our share,’ we’ve more than paid our share,” Teichert said. “That bugs me that they lie like that.”

Thornock said he would be happy to pay for any issues a net-metering solar system may cause—provided the new rate is fair, and preferably not suggested by a utility.

“We’re not asking for a handout. I don’t want Rocky Mountain Power subsidizing me,” he said. “I just want to be able to compete. I just want to be able to make a living.”

When told of Teichert and Thornock’s experience building their own power lines, Eskelsen was surprised, but said it was possible in such a rural area. “That’s not something that we typically allow,” he said.

But what really bothers Teichert and Thornock is the utility business model. In Wyoming, as determined by the Public Service Commission in the company’s latest rate case hearing, Rocky Mountain Power is entitled to a 9.5 percent return on equity, around the national average, according to S&P estimates. In other words, if Rocky Mountain Power uses shareholder funds to build long-term assets, like power plants, it can recover up to an additional 9.5 percent of the total value of those assets from its customers and deliver that back to shareholders as profit.

This incentivizes Rocky Mountain Power to “explode [their] costs,” Thornock said. “Ten percent of 10 million is a lot more than [10] percent of a million,” he continued. “Even I can do that math.”

At least one former utility executive believes that the nationwide average of around 10 percent return on equity for utilities is too lucrative, and should be closer to 6 percent to more appropriately reflect the benefits and risks of investing in a utility.

“We’re not asking for a handout. I don’t want Rocky Mountain Power subsidizing me. I just want to be able to compete. I just want to be able to make a living.”

— Jason Thornock

A utility’s return on equity is misunderstood, Eskelsen said, and functions more like a ceiling than a guarantee. Because utilities must “open our books to utility commissions,” who judge whether the company has spent prudently, they have a “powerful incentive” not to exaggerate their costs, he said. A commission disallowing a utility’s costs cuts profits for utility shareholders, he added.

Back in Teichert’s truck, he and Thornock laughed at the fantasy of getting a guaranteed profit on cattle and crop purchases. “I think that’s why there’s such a huge blowback from these utilities on net metering,” Thornock said. “They can see that if we let these guys produce their own power, they’re going to see right through all the nonsense.”

“And I don’t blame them,” he continued. “If I was in their shoes, man, that’s crazy money—and they’re protected by the government to do it.”

Staying Alive

For their way of life to remain sustainable for themselves, their kids and grandkids, Wyoming needs to either increase the net-meeting cap or change how it regulates utilities “so we can have something fair,” Teichert said.

But he and Thornock see many of Wyoming’s representatives as too deferential to utilities, and neither of them has much faith that the state will overhaul the system.

While it is not unusual for politicians in Wyoming to accept donations from sectors they regulate, at least one member of the Wyoming Senate has close professional ties to a utility. Dan Dockstader, a state Senator representing Teton and Lincoln counties, which includes Cokeville, is a board member of Lower Valley Energy, an electric cooperative.

As last year’s net-metering bill came up for a vote in the Senate, Dockstader amended the bill to exempt electric utility co-ops from Public Service Commission oversight when it came to setting net-metering customers’ rates. The commission now has “limited jurisdiction over eighteen retail rural electric cooperatives,” according to its website.

The amendment didn’t sit well with Thornock. “[Dockstader is] representing Lower Valley Energy, he’s not representing the people who are using the power,” he said.

“I was representing the interests of the Wyoming Rural Electric Association (WREA) with 14 electric power distribution cooperates and another three generation and transmission cooperates,” Dockstader said, in an email. “All efforts to pass legislation should include a balanced approach with the rural cooperatives.”

Those who have been trying to find a way to raise Wyoming’s net-metering cap agree that utilities hold a lot of sway with lawmakers in Cheyenne.

“We watched numerous amendments chip away at the original intent of the bill, to the point where we realized if it passed it would actually be a step back for rooftop solar deployment in Wyoming,” said John Burrows, climate and energy director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council.

“Utilities have established, professional lobbyists,” he continued. “They lobbied quite aggressively on this issue and I suspect that that had an impact on where the bill went.”

Moving forward, net-metering supporters are trying to resolve their differences with utility companies through a third-party facilitator before introducing another bill, according to Burrows.

“Net metering still needs to happen,” Thornock said. Other energy sources, like small modular nuclear reactors that can generate power without emissions, but rely on unproven technologies, intrigue him—but he worries they’ll also be hobbled by the kinds of problems plaguing net metering. “If we don’t get this net-meeting stuff figured out we’re not going to be able to take advantage of the technology that’s coming,” he said.

Clouds shrouded the high sun over Cokeville when Teichert dropped Thornock off at his house around noon. Cruising around his hometown, where he once taught middle school English, Teichert pointed out about half a dozen homes sporting rooftop solar panels. As the cost of living goes up, his 91-year-old mother’s house may be next.

“At some point, my mom’s gonna have to choose between, do you turn on the power or do you buy groceries?” he said.

Rising costs, including for electricity, pose a similar dilemma to his business. “If it gets to the point where you can’t afford to ranch, our only option is to start selling 35-acre parcels,” he said.

Eventually, Teichert navigated toward the mountains. He slowed to admire the clarity of a creek, pulled over to gush over the ski slopes just outside of town and spoke eloquently about Cokeville’s history as an energy hub. But on his way home, he saw ranchland that had been carved up and sold to developers, and his eyes winced with angst. He kept driving.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/042725_Bolster_Cokeville_034.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 10:01:34.612481

Dec. 14 (Reuters) - BNSF Railway, one of the crown jewels of Warren Buffett’s sprawling Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, calls itself an environmental leader in ⁠the U.S. rail industry with the cleanest locomotive fleet in North America.

“When ⁠you see our orange locomotives’ and freight cars’ ‍steel wheels moving on steel rails, think green,” BNSF says in its latest sustainability overview.

But the company is the largest player in an industry that has a pollution problem: U.S. freight railroads are a major source of pollution, chuffing out more nitrogen oxide, the primary component of smog, than all the nation’s coal-fired power plants combined, according to a Reuters calculation using government data.

U.S. railroads together produced about 485,000 tons of nitrogen oxide in 2024, compared to 452,000 tons emitted by U.S. coal-fired power plants, according to a Reuters calculation of reported annual fuel consumption multiplied by the EPA’s 2023 weighted-average emission rates.

BNSF, the nation's largest freight railroad, accounts for about a third of that total, producing 161,500 tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide in 2024, according to the ‍data. “We don't dispute your number. BNSF is the biggest Class I railroad by volume,” BNSF said in an email.

BNSF's position as largest in the rail industry, as well as its profitability, will be challenged if regulators approve the planned $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern, which would create the first U.S. coast-to-coast freight ​rail operator, Morningstar railroad analyst Greggory Warren said.

Reuters shared its calculations with four industry experts and all agreed it was a fair methodology. About 80% of the industry's NOx tons are produced by Class I railroads, the industry term for the six major railroads with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

Details on the rail industry’s recent NOx emissions performance, BNSF’s share of those emissions, and the factors driving the ongoing high levels of pollution have not previously been reported.

Railroad locomotive pollution causes an estimated $48 billion in healthcare costs and 3,100 premature deaths annually in ​the United States, according to the EPA’s Co-Benefits Risk Assessment tool.

“Americans don’t realize how much harmful pollution comes from old diesel locomotives,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, a California group that advocates for public health. “EPA should require the railroad companies to modernize their fleets,” he said.

The EPA declined to comment specifically on rail pollution for this story, but said: ""The Trump EPA is committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for all Americans.”

AGING FREIGHT LOCOMOTIVES

The railroad industry’s poor emissions performance is due mainly to the fact that it has largely stopped replacing its aging fleet of locomotives. The average age of U.S. locomotives is about 28 years, compared with 20 years in 2009, according to EPA and industry reports.

That's a problem because federal emissions standards for locomotives depend on how old they are with the oldest grandfathered into the lightest limits.

With no requirement to retire old locomotives, the U.S. freight rail ​industry has dragged its feet on buying new ones, a dynamic amplified by industry fears that new regulations under future administrations could render their investments obsolete, according to Environmental Protection Agency data, and interviews with analysts and railroad executives.

Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, says railroads have lost their taste for innovation. ""Our air pollution standards for railroads have an engine-sized loophole in them, which companies are using to... keep old, dirty trains on the tracks,"" Markey said in a statement to Reuters.

The rail industry says that it is the cleanest option available to move freight over land, and cites data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. A locomotive can move a ton of freight about 500 miles on a gallon of fuel, which is three to four times more efficient than trucks.

The Association of American Railroads said it was also unfair to compare rail to power plants, ​saying locomotives have little choice but to burn diesel. ""These power plants have multiple other viable options for generation – coal, natural gas, hydropower, wind, nuclear, etc. That is not the case for rail,"" the trade group told Reuters.

BNSF, meanwhile, told Reuters that it is working to reduce its emissions through efficiency and technology improvements, and stands by its claim to have the cleanest fleet in the industry based on the outright number of modern locomotives in its possession.

BNSF said 360 of its 6,780 total are modern locomotives subject to the strictest federal emissions standards, called Tier 4, the largest ‌outright number in the industry.

That's just 5% of the company's total fleet that is active or in storage, according to Surface Transportation Board data. By contrast, rival Canadian National has nearly 300 Tier 4 locomotives, making up about 27% of its total fleet, according to analysts and CN press releases about new locomotive orders.

Tier 4 locomotives operated by BNSF's nearest competitors number about 270 at Union Pacific; about 225 at CSX Corp.; and about 80 at Norfolk Southern, according to EPA data, company press releases and trade industry reports.

BNSF spent $394 million on 165 new and rebuilt locomotives from 2020 to 2024. That was down 69% from the prior five ​years when it spent $1.26 billion on 558 locomotives, as replacement of aging engines—some lasting up to 40 years—slowed sharply, according to BNSF annual reports filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.

CLEANEST FLEET?

BNSF's high emissions, however, are not just the result of ⁠its size.

BNSF’s fuel economy is the worst among the country’s six major railroads, according to railroad operating statistics filed with the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, the industry’s economic regulator.

In 2024, BNSF burned 1.14 gallons of diesel for every ton of weight it moved 1,000 miles, an industry metric called a gross ton mile. Union Pacific burned 1.08 gallons to move the same weight the same distance, and the most efficient, Canadian National, burned 0.88 gallons, according to the data.

Railroad industry analysts interviewed by Reuters said one reason for BNSF's low fuel economy is that it handles more intermodal freight than peers.

These high-priority shipping containers need to move faster than regular freight because they are typically more time-sensitive, said ‌Jason Kuehn, a railroad analyst and vice president at consulting firm Oliver Wyman.

BNSF's intermodal shipments totaled 5.3 million in 2024, or nearly 60% more than No. 2 Union Pacific, according to company disclosures.

Analysts said BNSF's efficiency is also likely hurt by its limited adoption of precision-scheduled railroading, an industry practice meant to reduce costs and fuel use through longer trains, fewer locomotives, and less idling time. Fuel efficiency can also be hindered by mountainous terrain and congestion on a railroad's network.

BNSF declined to comment on the reasons behind its relatively low fuel economy, but maintains it is an environmental leader in the industry based on its adoption of new locomotives, which allow it to burn fuel more cleanly.

“BNSF has the most modern platform locomotives in the rail industry, the basis for our cleanest fleet statement,” the company told Reuters.

It declined to provide details on its fleet-wide emissions intensity, and Reuters was unable to verify if it was better than rivals.

Tier 4 locomotives can reduce NOx emissions by about 80% compared to Tier 3 models, ‌according to the EPA.

FEAR OF REGULATION

The main reason railroads stopped spending big money on new locomotives is because they are worried new regulations - including proposed zero-emissions standards in California - could quickly make them obsolete.

""These locomotives have a lifespan of 40 to 45 years, and you're saying they won't be able to use those because we'll have zero emissions,"" said Roger Nober, director of George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center who retired as BNSF’s chief legal officer in 2023.

""Railroads don’t see that as an efficient ‌use of their capital.""

In 2008, the EPA hoped to clean up freight rail by setting new standards for locomotives, including higher standards for new Tier 3 and Tier 4 models. But rather than encourage replacement of old locomotives, rail companies have slowed down their purchases of new locomotives dramatically.

In 2008, the EPA estimated that at least 30% of freight locomotives would be operating under the strictest limits by 2025. But as of 2023 only 6.5% of 19,303 active locomotives operated by the big six railroads meet that limit, according to the EPA.

Before 2008, American railroads replaced their locomotives at a 4% rate per year, according to the U.S. Office of Transportation and Air Quality. By 2024, the industry replacement rate had dropped to 0.5% per year.

Neither BNSF nor its rivals provide exact data on the model years of active locomotives in their national fleets.

One key battle for the industry has been opposing California's proposed emissions standard, which would have banned locomotives older than 23 years from operating in ‍the state, and required all locomotives to be zero-emissions by 2035.

Because California is such a large market, it can effectively set the national standard.

Officials at the California Air Resources Board (CARB) estimated that by 2050 the stricter rules would have reduced 7,400 tons of diesel soot, 386,000 tons of NOx and cut cancer risk for those living near rail operations by up to 90%.

But it would have also barred 65% of active freight locomotives from operating in the state, rail officials say.

A week before Donald Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president in January, California withdrew the proposal.

Trump has been a frequent critic of CARB and was expected to block the initiative by denying ⁠California the waiver it would have needed to set state pollution rules that are tougher than federal ones.

In May, House Republicans introduced the Locomotives Act, which would prevent California from securing such waivers. The bill has been referred to the Energy and Commerce Committee.

FIGHTING GREEN TECHNOLOGY

The rail industry has also lobbied hard against the adoption of clean technologies. BNSF told the EPA last year at a public hearing that their test of a battery-electric locomotive failed to deliver enough power to move tons of freight over long distances.

""The battery had two megawatts of usable energy,” John Lovenburg, BNSF’s vice president for environment and sustainability, said. “That’s roughly 1/40th of the energy we will need for line-haul locomotives.”

Electric locomotives are viable for shorter routes and replacing diesel locomotives in switch yards, but for long distances they're limited by battery weight, said Alex Scott, a professor of supply chain management at the University of Tennessee.

Battery-electric locomotives are not prevalent in the United States and other parts of the world. But in China, India and Russia, a majority of their freight locomotives draw their power from overhead electric lines, or catenary systems.

That sort of electrification in North America would cost more than $1.1 trillion for 139,000 miles of track used by the six major railroads, according to a February 2025 study by the Association of American Railroads.

""The railroad industry is slow to adopt new things because if you have problems, it's not just your problem,"" Scott explained. ""You're creating problems for your customers and other railroads because they share track all of the time.""

Owned by the Seiko Epson Corporation, the brand is reinforcing its commitment to efficient, compact and precise innovation to address major environmental challenges.

A core component of Epson's philosophy is the reduction of its environmental footprint, with a particular emphasis on energy consumption across all its operations.

Epson's sustainability report outlines a clear strategy to achieve this, aiming to become carbon negative by 2050.

Decarbonisation and energy reduction targets

Epson’s strategy sets out ambitious, science-based targets for decarbonisation.

By 2030, Epson aims to cut its total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% and reduce its overall emissions by 55%.

These objectives are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target.

To meet these goals, Epson is concentrating on minimising energy consumption and reducing water use, waste and greenhouse gas emissions, especially within its European facilities.

Takanori Inaho, President of Epson Europe, says: “As we celebrate 50 years of the Epson brand, our commitment to pushing technology boundaries and driving meaningful sustainable change has never been stronger.

""The approval of our climate goals by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) formalises our ambition to become carbon negative by 2050, reshaping how we operate and collaborate throughout our value chain.""

To tackle Scope 3 emissions, which account for the largest portion of its carbon footprint, Epson has incorporated the end use of its products and the procurement of raw materials into its science-based targets.

Energy efficiency

A key step in its energy reduction journey during FY24 was the relocation of its UK headquarters to a more energy-efficient building.

The new office does not use gas for heating, a move that has contributed to a 56% reduction in Epson’s total gas consumption across its operations.

Epson intends to use its own technology to advance digitisation and automation, deploying manufacturing solutions designed to save energy and space.

Through these innovations, Epson plans to lessen its overall environmental impact while continuing to meet market demands and enhance productivity.

Boris Manev, Sustainability Director at Epson Europe, says: “We recognise that embedding responsible practices throughout our operations is an evolving process requiring dedication, transparency and collaboration.

""By aligning our ESG efforts with evolving regulations, we mitigate risks, unlock opportunities and reinforce our leadership in responsible innovation and corporate governance.”

A circular model for resource efficiency

Epson is also focused on closing the resource loop to foster a circular economy, which has direct implications for energy use.

Epson's goal is to use resources more efficiently and extend the life of its products through reuse and refurbishment programmes.

For instance, faulty printers can be returned, assessed and repaired before being resold.

This process extends the product lifespan, meaning the energy and raw materials required for new manufacturing are conserved.

In November 2024, Epson also introduced an ink cartridge refill initiative to collect and reuse spent inkjet cartridges.

As part of this programme, Epson plans to optimise pallet configurations and improve reverse logistics.

Engaging customers and partners to increase return rates could contribute substantially to Epson's wider sustainability and energy-saving objectives.

“Recognised with Platinum EcoVadis status, Epson is dedicated to responsible sustainability leadership,” Takanori says.

“The choices we make today will shape the next 50 years – and we are ready to lead with purpose and determination.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/74ab59c2b96acede31cad7daa4e2f7b4:3a0e7750ae5b2a96ef667f57b3320681/closed-resourse-loop-05.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 04:58:31.737346

The White House's policy pivot has thrown billions of dollars' worth of U.S. offshore wind projects into turmoil. Industry interest and investment are looking elsewhere, and developing regions with ample wind resources, such as Southeast Asia, have the most to gain from this likely reshuffling, analysts say.

Wind energy is essential to efforts to curb climate change, scientists say, as global temperatures drift perilously higher. Offshore wind, which uses turbines installed in the sea, is set to grow rapidly because it can harness stronger, steadier ocean winds to generate clean electricity, the International Energy Agency says.

Southeast Asia, with its archipelago nations, long coastlines and consistently windy seas, is emerging as one of the world's most promising regions for this technology. As energy demand continues to rise, the Philippines and Vietnam are building policy momentum that proponents hope will spur interest across the region.

Those moves could turn Southeast Asia into a model for other developing nations seeking to use wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, said Rebecca Williams, with the Global Wind Energy Council.

""Asia and Southeast Asia are a beacon of hope for the industry,"" she said.

Trump has actively sought to kill the U.S. offshore wind industry, one of his presidential campaign promises.

He opposes using renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes burning fossil fuels for electricity, contending that climate change is a hoax.

The White House has halted construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked and paused permits, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for wind energy and cut $679 million in federal funding for a dozen projects -- a complete reversal from former President Joe Biden's Administration.

Trump's anti-renewable energy stance has shaken U.S. confidence in offshore wind projects.

That has kickstarted an industry-wide search for other places to invest.

Globally, wind energy generation is growing, led by China. It dominates wind power installations and manufactures more than half of the world's wind turbines. Beijing is also emerging as a quiet force in the region's offshore wind buildout, supplying turbines and engineering expertise as countries race to tap their coastal wind potential.

""We're seeing more governments in the Global South, especially in countries in Asia, who haven't had that background in offshore wind, now really step up,"" Williams said.

Home to half of the global population, Asia is expected to account for much of the world's future energy demand. Yet the region still relies heavily on fossil fuels, and wind generates barely 7% of Asia-Pacific's electricity, according to the International Energy Agency.

The 11-member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, a vast region that includes tiny Brunei to populous Indonesia, have no installed wind power capacity.

So there's a lot of untapped potential up for grabs, said Amisha Patel, with the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, an organization of countries promoting offshore wind.

Trump's rhetoric is disappointing given America's vast wind potential, but it hasn't slowed global wind power developments, and ""Southeast Asia is stepping forward as the U.S. retreats,"" she said.

Last month, Singapore announced a three-year plan for wind energy conferences to attract investment and become a regional hub for the industry.

""Asia is looking very, very attractive because of the momentum that we're seeing there and the core understanding of the value of offshore wind,"" Patel said.

The Philippines and Vietnam have an early advantage.

The Philippines held its first offshore wind auction in November, allowing companies to bid and compete for the right to build 3.3 gigawatts of wind farms on designated seabeds. Energy Secretary Sharon Garin said that shifted offshore wind power from ""potential to reality,"" with clear rules and plans for how wind farms will connect to the grid, which ports they'll use and how equipment will be moved.

""The Philippines is ready to compete for global investment,"" she said in a statement.

Filipino corporation ACEN partnered with Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners in May to co-develop the nation's first large-scale offshore wind project, aiming for up to 1 gigawatt in the central Philippine province of Camarines Sur.

Vietnam has revived long-stalled offshore wind ambitions, issuing new rules and courting foreign investors. It revised its national power plan in April, targeting up to 17 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, and is speeding up marine zoning rules and updating permitting procedures.

Regulatory delays led Norway's Equinor to withdraw from Vietnam in 2024, but investor confidence is slowly growing. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners is working with state-owned PetroVietnam on an offshore wind project in south-central Vietnam and Germany's PNE AG is planning a $4.6 billion, 2-gigawatt farm in Binh Dinh province.

Vietnam is exploring regional projects. It signed a deal in May for a transmission line to export power to Singapore and Malaysia.

China is also emerging as an important player in the region. State-owned Power China completed the Binh Dai offshore wind power project in Vietnam in November, according to the China's official Xinhua news agency. In the Philippines, Mingyang Smart Energy is exploring a 2-gigawatt project in Northern Luzon.

Extreme weather is a challenge for offshore wind, especially in the Philippines and Vietnam, which endured an onslaught of deadly typhoons this year.

What's the story

Global electric vehicle (EV) sales have surged by 21% in November compared to the same period in 2024, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. The research firm noted that two million EVs were sold worldwide during the month. This brings the total global EV sales for the year to date to an impressive 18.5 million units. Europe has emerged as a major contributor to this growth, while North America continues to lag behind.

Market dynamics

Europe's EV market outpaces North America

The European EV market witnessed a remarkable 36% year-on-year growth in November 2025. Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales rose by 35%, while Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) sales jumped by an impressive 39%. This brings Europe's total EV sales for the year to date to a whopping 3.8 million units, up by 33% from January-November 2024. Meanwhile, North America continues to trail after US EV tax credits expired on September 30, 2025.

Growth factors

France and Italy boost EV sales with new initiatives

France has finally returned to year-to-date growth in November, up 1% after spending most of 2025 in the red due to earlier subsidy cuts. The rebound was led by automakers such as Volkswagen and Renault, a wider selection of EV models, and France's ""leasing social"" program aimed at helping lower-income households switch to EVs. Meanwhile, Italy saw record EV sales of just under 25,000 units in November after launching a new incentive program aimed at replacing older internal combustion vehicles.

Potential Uses and Future Development The researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat.
For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.
Co-authors of the study include Amit Bhardwaj, Blaise Fleury, Eldo Abraham and Taewoo Lee, all postdoctoral research associates in the Department of Physics at CU Boulder.
Bohdan Senyuk, Jan Bart ten Hove and Vladyslav Cherpak, former postdoctoral researchers at CU Boulder, also contributed as co-authors.","The material is called Mesoporous Optically Clear Heat Insulator, or MOCHI. It can be manufactured as thick blocks or thin flexible sheets that attach to the interior surface of standard windows. At present, MOCHI is only produced in the laboratory and is not yet available to consumers, but the researchers report that it is durable and nearly completely see-through.

Because of its clarity, MOCHI maintains an unobstructed view, which sets it apart from many other window insulation products.

""To block heat exchange, you can put a lot of insulation in your walls, but windows need to be transparent,"" said Ivan Smalyukh, senior author of the study and a professor of physics at CU Boulder. ""Finding insulators that are transparent is really challenging.""

The research team published its findings on Dec. 11 in the journal Science.

Why Window Heat Loss Matters

Buildings of all kinds, from houses to large office towers, account for about 40% of global energy consumption. Much of that energy is wasted as heat escapes to the outdoors during winter or enters buildings during hot weather.

Smalyukh and his collaborators hope MOCHI will slow that unwanted heat flow.

The new material is a silicone-based gel with a complex internal structure. It contains air trapped within extremely fine pores that are far thinner than a human hair. These microscopic pockets make MOCHI an excellent thermal barrier. In fact, a sheet only 5 millimeters thick is enough to let a person safely hold a flame against it.

""No matter what the temperatures are outside, we want people to be able to have comfortable temperatures inside without having to waste energy,"" said Smalyukh, a fellow at the Renewable And Sustainable Energy Institute (RASEI) at CU Boulder.

How MOCHI Controls Light and Heat

Smalyukh described the key to MOCHI's performance as its precisely arranged air pockets.

The new material shares similarities with aerogels, which are well-known insulators used in many industries. (NASA uses aerogels inside its Mars rovers to keep electronics warm). Aerogels also rely on air-filled pores, but those pores are typically arranged in a random pattern that scatters light. This is why aerogels often appear cloudy and are sometimes referred to as ""frozen smoke.""

The CU Boulder team wanted an insulating material that would maintain clarity while providing strong thermal resistance.

To build MOCHI, researchers combined surfactant molecules with a liquid mixture. These molecules naturally cluster into thread-like shapes, somewhat like the separation that occurs when oil and vinegar form layers in salad dressing. Silicone molecules in the same mixture attach themselves to the surface of those tiny threads.

Through several controlled steps, the researchers then remove the detergent clusters and replace them with air. This leaves behind a silicone framework surrounding a network of ultra-small, air-filled channels. Smalyukh likens the intricate pattern to a ""plumber's nightmare.""

Air accounts for more than 90% of MOCHI's volume.

Stopping Heat at the Molecular Scale

Heat travels through a gas in a way similar to a billiards-style chain reaction. Energy causes gas molecules and atoms to move faster and collide with one another, passing heat along as they strike.

The pores inside MOCHI are so tiny that the gas molecules cannot freely collide. Instead, they repeatedly hit the silicone walls, which prevents heat from easily spreading through the material.

""The molecules don't have a chance to collide freely with each other and exchange energy,"" Smalyukh said. ""Instead, they bump into the walls of the pores.""

Despite this strong heat blocking ability, MOCHI reflects only about .2% of incoming light, allowing nearly all visible light to pass through.

Potential Uses and Future Development

The researchers envision many applications for a clear material that effectively traps heat. One possibility is a device that captures warmth from sunlight and converts it into low-cost, sustainable energy.

""Even when it's a somewhat cloudy day, you could still harness a lot of energy and then use it to heat your water and your building interior,"" Smalyukh said.

For now, MOCHI is not ready for commercial release. Its laboratory production requires considerable time, although Smalyukh believes that more efficient manufacturing methods can be developed. The components used to make MOCHI are relatively low-cost, which supports the long-term potential for scaling the technology.

For the moment, the outlook for MOCHI remains promising, much like the clear view through a window coated with this material.

He noted that the joint effort intends to build infrastructure at scale and change how energy companies function.
Similarly, Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian stated that combining NextEra’s domain expertise with Google’s AI infrastructure is necessary to support the digital future of energy infrastructure and meet the rising demand for AI technologies.","NextEra Energy and Google Cloud announced a significant expansion of their ongoing collaboration, creating a partnership designed to develop multiple gigawatt (GW)-scale data center campuses across the United States.

This new initiative builds upon a substantial existing portfolio between the two companies, which already encompasses approximately 3.5 GW of power capacity that is either currently in operation or under contract.

The deal addresses the escalating energy requirements of the technology sector, a trend further highlighted by the companies’ recent agreements to add 600 megawatts of clean energy capacity to the electricity grid in Oklahoma.

The companies are currently in the active development phase for the first three campuses under this new agreement and have set a target of mid-2026 for the release of their first commercial technology product on the Google Cloud Marketplace.

Accelerate deployment of data centers

This collaborative effort focuses on accelerating the deployment of data centers by systematically addressing critical infrastructure hurdles.

These challenges include land acquisition, managing load interconnection, and the simultaneous development of supporting power generation resources needed to sustain large-scale artificial intelligence operations.A central component of this energy strategy involves the revitalization of nuclear power capabilities to support the electrical grid.

“Most recently, the companies announced the restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa followed by two new long-term power purchase agreements to add 600 megawatts of clean energy capacity to Oklahoma’s electricity grid to support Google’s technology infrastructure,” noted a press release.

To facilitate this restart, NextEra Energy has formally requested that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) restore grid connection rights for the shuttered facility.

This regulatory filing seeks to reclaim interconnection rights that had previously been transferred from the nuclear plant to a planned solar energy project at the same site.

The move follows a licensing change request that NextEra filed with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in January, marking a distinct shift from solar back to nuclear baseload power to meet steady demand.

Digital transformation of operations

Beyond the construction of physical infrastructure, the partnership will implement a digital transformation of NextEra Energy’s operations using Google Cloud’s artificial intelligence tools.

This integration will utilize Google’s “TimesFM 2.5” time-series open-source forecasting model and the “WeatherNext 2” weather forecasting system. By combining these AI capabilities with NextEra’s proprietary asset data, the companies aim to improve grid reliability and resilience.

“Pairing NextEra Energy’s capabilities with Google’s latest time-series open source forecasting model, weather forecasting model and security-constrained power flow modeling will give NextEra Energy and its customers better insights into system optimization opportunities, enhancing utilities’ planning and grid management efforts to keep costs affordable while making electric service more reliable and resilient,” highlighted the press release.

This approach is designed to maintain safety and reduce operational costs for both the utility and its customers, particularly as the grid faces challenges from aging assets and unprecedented load growth.

NextEra Energy Chairman and CEO John Ketchum characterized the partnership as a reflection of the current moment where the energy and technology sectors are becoming increasingly intertwined.

The report suggests cancellations may drive electricity prices higher as supply fails to meet surging demand, with price increases already visible in some regions.

The cancellations stem from Trump administration opposition, local community pushback, escalating grid interconnection costs, battery value drops, and offshore wind policy disruption.

The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

As the Trump administration sheds staff and funding at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new analysis places Louisiana among states that have notably slashed their pollution regulation resources even as industry expands.

The report from the Environmental Integrity Project evaluated staffing and changes in operating budgets at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality and comparable agencies in other states. From 2010 through 2024, the numbers show the agency’s personnel count decreased 24% with 222 positions eliminated from the agency. The department’s budget shrank 26% over the 14 year period, pulled from an analysis of public records provided by the department.

“These cuts increase the risk that residents will face higher levels of pollution, especially if the EPA lacks the funding and capacity to do its job,” Environmental Integrity Project executive director Jen Duggan said Wednesday during a news conference for the report’s release.

“In Louisiana, we feel them deeply,” said Anne Rolfes, director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade who also took part in the news conference.

The report focused on the Department of Environmental Quality’s operating budget, or the money it spends to handle day-to-day tasks such as paying employees, maintaining facilities, lab analysis and grants to local governments. Large loans and federal grants, which are considered as capital costs, were excluded from the analysis where possible to avoid outliers because they vary widely from year to year and “do not measure a state’s capacity” to limit pollution, according to the report’s methodology.

The staffing cuts at Louisiana’s Department of Environmental Quality are “among the most of any state,” according to the report. Other standouts included Mississippi, which reduced its environmental agency funding 71% from 2010 to 2024.

On the other end of the spectrum is California, which increased its environmental operating budget by 364% over the same 14 years.

At the federal level, the Trump administration has said it intends to bring the EPA’s employee count down to levels last seen during the Reagan era, when the agency had between 11,000 and 14,000 people of staff, NPR reported. It began Trump’s second term with about 15,000 employees.

The majority of environmental agency staffing cuts in Louisiana happened during Bobby Jindal’s terms as governor from 2008-16. The Department of Environmental Quality has not seen significant hiring or funding boosts dating back to Edwin Edwards’ fourth term as governor from 1992-96.

The agency’s boldest policy moves came after Gov. Buddy Roemer took office in 1988. He placed environmental scientist Paul Templet in charge of Environmental Quality, and the administration tied industrial incentives to benchmarks for reducing pollution. Since Roemer lost his reelection bid in 1991, governors who have succeeded him have, to varying degrees, urged cooperation with industry.

The Environmental Integrity Project report points out cuts in Department of Environmental Quality staff and funding come as Louisiana sees a boom in industrial investment. The number of facilities seeking air pollution control permits from the state rose 29% from 2016-24, with 1,906 applications last year according to the report’s analysis of public records.

A spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality responded to the report in a statement, saying the department meets all federal grant requirements and performance expectations while prioritizing “efficiency” and remaining “fully committed” to environmental protection.

The department has implemented an expedited permitting program to make up for its staffing shortages, allowing applicants to pay for agency staff members’ overtime as they work on the approval process.

Rolfes cites issues with this process in the report, saying it creates a conflict of interest.

“When you cut the resources of the agencies, you further depend on the companies themselves as the source of payment for permit writers — and that is an inherent conflict,” Rolfes wrote in the report. “When you have the company paying your overtime, you are just not going to ask the questions and scrutinize it the way you would if your salaries were being paid by the public.”

The analysis also identified Louisiana as having the highest amount of toxic air emissions per square mile of any state in the country. Staffing shortages also play a role in delayed response time to pollution issues, according to the report.

In 2019, the Environmental Integrity Project report counted only 10 LDEQ employees who handled all air enforcement actions at more than 500 major industrial facilities and hundreds more smaller locations. A Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report from 2021 also found the department was understaffed and could do more to address air pollution violations.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/westcentralsbest.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b44a2b66-f4e9-11e4-83a0-3bbd4468f030.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-12-14 04:58:51.755850

The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession.
Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy.","MASSACHUSETTS HAS EXPERIENCED a full assault on the basic pillars of our innovation economy. Clean energy programs and infrastructure, biomedical research funding, immigration, and core funding and academic freedom at our state’s leading universities have all landed in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s reckless cuts and ideologically extreme policy agenda.

While President Trump wraps this all in America First rhetoric, these moves will severely undermine our country’s ability to compete economically and remain a global leader in cutting-edge research and development. Given the outsized role these areas play here, the threat to Massachusetts is particularly acute.

The Commonwealth needs to act boldly and creatively to respond to the threats to its innovation economy. Fighting to reverse these moves in Washington should be a top priority, but we surely can’t count on that happening. We may not be able, on our own, to mitigate the full impact of these harmful policies, but we can take action at the state level to counter their effects.

Over the summer, Gov. Healey unveiled a proposal to do just that. The Discovery, Research and Innovation for a Vibrant Economy, or DRIVE, Initiative includes a call for $400 million in state appropriations to help make up for some of the lost federal funding.

Committing public dollars to help bolster or jumpstart economic activity is not something that should be done lightly without due diligence and careful consideration. But in weighing the governor’s proposal, legislative leaders don’t have to look back too far for an example of unquestionable success with such a strategy.

It may be hard to remember, but Massachusetts wasn’t always the leading state for the innovation economy. In 2003, despite our state’s deep strengths in finance, health care, and higher education, the major economic story of the day was Boston losing Fortune 500 headquarters.

The Commonwealth had invested heavily in remaking Boston’s downtown and waterfront, but 20 years ago the Seaport was best known for inexpensive parking lots. The state’s economy had crashed in 2001, and it was only slowly regaining the jobs lost during the recession. In 2004, the Boston Foundation bemoaned the fact that greater Boston “lacked the collaborative gene,” which was essential to competing in the global knowledge economy. There was significant pessimism disguised as realism – which all made sense if you were a fan of the Boston Red Sox during the many decades leading to October of that momentous year.

As seen in the sudden reversal that year of our baseball fortunes, however, the world changes – sometimes quicker than you expect. I served in the Patrick administration during both of the governor’s terms, eventually as the state’s first assistant secretary for innovation policy in the Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development, and witnessed this firsthand.

Working under Secretary Dan O’Connell and the late Secretary Greg Bialecki, both of whom helmed the housing and economic development secretariat under Gov. Patrick, I had a chance to see and participate in initiatives that had a catalytic effect on the state’s innovation economy.

In 2008, Gov. Patrick and the Legislature partnered to launch the state’s 10-year, $1 billion Life Sciences Initiative, which served as a catalyst for regional partnerships and international investment.

The scale of the initiative drew international attention and investment in Massachusetts, while the vast majority of the state funds invested (over 70 percent of funds through FY 2014) were spent on research and development infrastructure and educational programs throughout the state. A 2018 impact study showed that Massachusetts outperformed peer states in life sciences wage and job growth from 2009 through 2016, providing evidence that the initiative did make a meaningful difference in improving the state’s competitiveness.

In 2009, the state provided seed funding for MassChallenge, one of the world’s largest startup accelerators and competitions. Anyone who attended a MassChallenge event can readily attest that it had a dynamic effect – as if a world-class region was meeting itself for the first time. MassChallenge reinforced the state’s international reputation for innovation while also supporting the state’s entrepreneurial ecosystem by inviting winners from regional startup accelerators to join its program.

In 2012, the state’s five largest research universities partnered to open the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center – a major research facility – in Holyoke. It was the first significant collaboration to ever take place among these universities – and there, too, a seed investment by the state was critical to its success. Through the computing center, the partner universities have sponsored collaborative research by faculty across their schools and with external partners, with the goal to make our state more competitive for major federal research funding opportunities.

Unquestionably, the Commonwealth is right to focus on a triad of long-term challenges that threaten our economic health and competitiveness: affordable housing, education and workforce development, and safe and efficient transportation. Progress in those areas creates a more livable state for all of us and unlocks bottlenecks to hiring and growth. But it won’t be enough to forestall the worst impacts of current federal policy.

The actions of the federal government strike at the very heart of our state’s competitive advantage. Massachusetts is a magnet for the world’s talent, from undergraduate students to postdocs to regional headquarters for major multinational corporations. We thrive on collaboration and the sophistication of our experienced researchers, investors, executives, advanced manufacturers, and technicians.

Collaboration is at the heart of our success. And collaboration requires trust, mutually agreed upon goals, resources, and sufficient stability over time to execute on plans. It requires belief, hope, and expectation that hard work will lead to accomplishment, whether that is in six months, a year or five years. The state investments described above succeeded in part because they were sustained commitments that improved capacity and created a reliable state partner that enabled the private sector and universities to make long-term plans and investments of their own.

That’s why it is imperative that our state’s leaders – from government, education, and industry – partner and respond robustly to this threat.

The House and Senate, with whatever modifications they deem appropriate, should move quickly to pass the DRIVE Act, which is designed to stabilize and grow our state’s research and innovation ecosystem. Roughly half of the funds would be devoted to backfilling some of the support for our universities, investing in promising research proposals that went through rigorous scientific review prior to the federal cuts.

The second half of the funds would support new collaborative research and initiatives that can accelerate our innovation economy. For new initiatives, the Commonwealth should require substantial direct and in-kind matches to magnify the impact of state dollars. In addition, the state should be ambitious in choosing initiatives that bring together multiple partners and advance national research priorities that have been defunded or opposed by the Trump administration.

We are, eventually, going to come out of this unsettling era. How we do so is up to us. In a moment in which fear and uncertainty abound, we should set the goal for Massachusetts to emerge as the strongest, most competitive innovation state in the nation in 2029.

Approach 2: Bloom Energy Price vs Sales

For companies like Bloom Energy that are still scaling and not yet consistently profitable, the Price to Sales, or P S, ratio is often a more practical valuation tool than earnings based metrics. It anchors valuation to current revenue, which is less volatile and easier to compare across peers.

In general, higher growth and lower risk can justify a higher P S multiple, while slower growth or greater uncertainty point to a lower, more conservative range. Bloom Energy currently trades at about 12.35x sales, well above both the Electrical industry average of roughly 2.17x and the peer group average of around 3.02x. This signals that investors are already pricing in substantial growth and improvement in profitability.

Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework goes a step further by estimating what a P S multiple should be, given Bloom’s growth outlook, margins, industry, market cap and risk profile. On this basis, Bloom’s Fair Ratio is 8.44x, which is meaningfully below the current 12.35x. That gap suggests the stock price is running ahead of what its fundamentals and risks would justify.

The worldwide shift toward sustainable energy has dramatically altered the strategies of institutional investors, with clean energy derivatives now standing out as a vital asset class. In 2025, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) granted CleanTrade approval to operate as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF), marking a significant advancement in the renewable energy sector. This regulatory breakthrough has helped resolve persistent issues such as market fragmentation and limited liquidity, positioning clean energy as a leading destination for institutional funds. This article delves into the operational models of CFTC-sanctioned platforms and examines the influx of institutional capital, highlighting how these developments are transforming liquidity in renewable energy assets.

Regulatory Advances and Market Evolution

When the CFTC approved CleanTrade in September 2025, it brought much-needed regulatory certainty to the market by overturning a 2021 advisory that had previously created confusion among participants. This move allowed CleanTrade to function as a centralized, high-standard venue for trading Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). Within just two months of its debut, CleanTrade saw $16 billion in notional trades, reflecting strong institutional trust in energy markets aligned with ESG principles.

The CFTC’s flexible approach extended beyond CleanTrade. In 2025, the agency withdrew its proposed Operational Resilience Framework for SEFs, citing overlap with existing rules and the need to harmonize with global standards. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce compliance complexity while upholding market integrity. For example, the CFTC granted exemptions to SEFs such as LSEG FX SEF, allowing them to forgo mandatory central limit order books—an acknowledgment of the practicalities of swaps trading. These regulatory adjustments have fostered a more dynamic environment, encouraging further innovation in clean energy derivatives.

Institutional Capital and Market Liquidity

Institutional participation in clean energy derivatives has grown rapidly. Bloomberg projects that ESG investments will soar from $39.08 trillion in 2025 to $125.17 trillion by 2032. In 2025, investments in clean energy surpassed those in fossil fuels by $1.1 trillion, with major players like BlackRock and Goldman Sachs increasingly focusing on renewables within their portfolios. CleanTrade’s integration of real-time analytics, carbon tracking, and advanced risk management tools has enabled investors to better align with ESG goals and manage counterparty risks.

Recent data further illustrates this momentum. In the third quarter of 2025, U.S. investment in clean energy and transportation reached a record $75 billion, with $25 billion directed toward clean energy production and industrial decarbonization—a 15% increase over the previous year, fueled by demand for electric vehicles and renewable infrastructure. However, the second quarter of 2025 showed mixed results: while utility-scale clean electricity and industrial decarbonization technologies grew by 13% compared to the previous quarter, investment in manufacturing for greenhouse gas reduction technologies fell by 15%. These fluctuations underscore the value of liquid, transparent markets like CleanTrade, which help stabilize institutional portfolios through reliable pricing and scalable risk management.

Broadening the Clean Energy Trading Ecosystem

CleanTrade is just one of several platforms shaping the future of clean energy derivatives. Between 2025 and 2026, the CFTC authorized additional venues, including Electron Exchange DCM, Railbird Exchange, and Quanta Exchange, reflecting a diversification of the market. Nodal Exchange, a prominent player in power and environmental markets, has expanded its offerings by launching new REC contracts and a web-based trading platform to improve accessibility. Together, these platforms cater to a wide range of regional and sector-specific needs, from small-scale solar initiatives to large-scale energy storage, making clean energy assets more attractive to institutional investors worldwide.

Ongoing Challenges and the Road Ahead

Despite significant progress, obstacles remain. The Q2 2025 Clean Investment Monitor reported a 36% drop in U.S. renewable energy investment compared to the latter half of 2024, while investment in the EU-27 surged by 63%. These regional imbalances highlight the necessity for harmonized regulations and cross-border liquidity solutions. Additionally, the cancellation of $7 billion in energy projects in Q2 2025 underscores the volatility inherent in capital-intensive industries.

Looking forward, the CFTC’s commitment to modernizing its regulatory approach—such as its spot crypto trading initiative—signals an ongoing focus on fostering innovation. Platforms like CleanTrade and Nodal Exchange are expected to play a pivotal role in connecting traditional energy markets with the demands of the green transition. As institutional investors increasingly prioritize decarbonization, the transparency and liquidity offered by CFTC-approved SEFs will be essential for scaling up renewable energy infrastructure.

Summary

The rise of CFTC-approved clean energy trading platforms marks a fundamental transformation in institutional investment. By overcoming market fragmentation, boosting liquidity, and supporting ESG objectives, these platforms are not only revolutionizing renewable asset markets but also redefining the influence of institutional capital in the global energy transition. As regulations adapt and new platforms emerge, clean energy derivatives are set to become a cornerstone of global investment strategies in the coming decade.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 03:58:24.203789

The Future U project, which began construction this summer, is a three-year renovation meant to reuse a majority of the original foundation built in 1972.

According to Melissa Soto, manager of Capital Program Development at Beach Building Services, approximately 90% of the USU’s original foundation will remain.

One of the few areas slated for demolition and replacement is the University Dining Plaza. Additionally, the 1972 plumbing and electrical systems will be replaced.

“It’s a really great opportunity to upgrade everything just to make the building function well and to reorganize,” says Soto.

A study from the Environmental Protection Agency found that around 600 million tons of construction and demolition debris were generated nationwide in 2018.

To avoid adverse environmental impacts, the Future U project seeks to reduce waste and source sustainably. According to Soto, furniture and building materials will be sourced within the U.S.

“Most new student unions are built new from the ground up, which means they require entirely new materials,” said Lisa Salgado, the Capital Projects Program manager at Beach Building Services, in an email exchange with the Current.

By using the majority of the 1972 foundation, BBS seeks to maintain the vision of the original building’s architect, Edward Killingsworth.

The student union is eligible but not yet registered for the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources, which work to preserve the cultural and artistic integrity of historic buildings and artifacts.

By preserving key historic elements of the original USU, such as the terracotta flooring and vintage tiles, the student union will remain eligible. Because of this, maintaining the USU’s mid-century modern style is important for the university.

According to Salgado, material reuse will reduce the carbon footprint of Future U and expedite construction.

Currently, the building is undergoing abatement, a process in which hazmat crews will conduct a complete sweep for hazardous materials, including asbestos, lead and more.

According to BBS’s 2024 Design Standards Manual, 95% of post-abatement waste will be sent to construction recycling centers. The 5% of ineligible materials will be sent to landfills.

Some materials are sent to special disposal sites where they have to be treated further, Soto said.

California State law required the CSU system to divert 75% of all solid waste from landfill disposal by 2020 through source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting programs.

The Future U project is maintaining these rates. 75% of the waste produced by the Future U project will be recycled or salvaged, according to Salgado.

“There’s construction waste recycling centers…that we take the material to where it gets recycled just as you would recycle your cans,” Soto said.

BBS is confident in the original structure’s strength – despite it being over 50 years old – and is implementing construction techniques to reinforce it.

“We do type one construction, where the interior is concrete,” Soto said. “We’re trying to build these really strong, long-lasting things.”

Type one construction uses non-combustable materials such as reinforced concrete and protected steel.

According to the National Fire Protection Association, Type I construction offers the highest level of fire protection and projects are considered noncombustible.

The original USU foundation is also being reinforced to meet modern-day seismic standards. An evaluation of the building was conducted to assess its ability to withstand earthquakes.

“There’s certain areas in the building that we do need to strengthen seismically, but it’s really not a lot, which is really exciting,” Soto said.

That gives BBS less work and allows them more time to make good on their promise of a 2028 opening.

In addition to the strong infrastructure, Future U will also introduce over 80 low-volatile organic compound materials into the new design.

VOCs are human-made chemicals that may pose short and long-term health risks. VOCs are emitted as gases from solid or liquid materials and are present in many common building materials.

“Low-VOC materials will keep the air healthy so all visitors can focus, socialize, and thrive,” Salgado said in an email exchange with the Current.

Many of the low-VOC materials listed in the Future U “Low-VOC Material Tracker” spreadsheet include paints, carpets and wall panels.

While the Future U project is still three years from completion, the renovation is necessary and will be worth it in the long run, Soto said.

“It’s lasted fairly well for 50 years,” she said. “Our goal is that we don’t have to touch [it] again for another 50 years.”",https://lbcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mural.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 22:58:06.736151

US District Judge Patti Saris agreed, writing in her order that the “Wind Order” was illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” exercise of federal power, not to mention weird and creepy.
There wasn’t even a concept of a plan for regulatory review, because the point was simply to prevent new wind energy from coming online at all.
As for Monday’s decision overturning the Wind Order, the White House’s first response was, as always, to whine.
Now that Judge Saris has deflated Trump’s Wind Order, states and companies will still need to sue to move wind projects forward, causing costly delays and probably killing some projects altogether, so progress will remain slow.","In a blow to Donald Trump’s irrational war against wind energy, a federal judge in Massachusetts on Monday overturned Trump’s Day One executive order that had frozen all leases and permits for offshore wind energy projects. Seventeen states, led by New York but reaching across the country to Oregon and California, had joined the lawsuit, arguing that they and their residents were being harmed by the refusal to add clean, cheaper energy to the grid. US District Judge Patti Saris agreed, writing in her order that the “Wind Order” was illegal because it was an “arbitrary and capricious” exercise of federal power, not to mention weird and creepy.

Trump’s order placed an indefinite pause on all offshore wind energy development so that federal agencies could “review” the permitting process, supposedly to remove any of those mean unfair advantages that Joe Biden used to oppress wind’s poor, downtrodden competitors in the fossil fuel industry. As testimony in the case showed, however, hardly any such “review” had even begun, even 10 months after the order. There wasn’t even a concept of a plan for regulatory review, because the point was simply to prevent new wind energy from coming online at all.

In fact, lawyers for the administration agencies involved couldn’t demonstrate any real rationale for the stonewalling on permits beyond pointing to Trump’s executive order and the Department of the Interior’s memo putting the pause into place. Judge Saris wrote that the thin justifications given in those documents alone were insufficient to effectively shut down an entire industry. “Whatever level of explanation is required when deviating from longstanding agency practice, this is not it.”

OK, you were waiting for the “However,” weren’t you? Here we go: However, the order on its own doesn’t automatically approve any pending wind projects, and as Ars Technica explains, Judge Saris’s order can’t force the relevant agencies to stop simply slow-walking every project that’s in the pipeline, as well as new leases or permits. But it does at least mean that states and offshore wind developers can go ahead and sue the government for gumming up the process simply because Trump hates wind turbines and wants to protect dirty energy.

In fact, one such lawsuit, brought by the Danish wind energy company Ørsted, has already successfully lifted the administration’s stop-work order on a giant wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. When it’s completed next year, the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project, initially approved in 2023, will bring carbon-free electricity to more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. But in August, the administration ordered a halt to construction, even though Revolution Wind was more than 80 percent complete, claiming that the plant was somehow a “national security” threat.

The stop-work order didn’t get into specifics, probably because it would have been laughed out of court, because when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum tried to explain it on CNN, he came up with some weird speculation about how, ummm, let’s see, what if the wind turbines kept radar from detecting a big attack by, umm, “undersea drones” launched inside US territorial waters? That makes no goddamn sense at all because radar doesn’t work underwater and the Pentagon has already studied the possibility of wind turbines affecting radar, concluding that any minor interference can be “offset with planning and technological upgrades.” You fucking idiots.

As it was, DC Circuit Judge Royce Lamberth in September granted Ørsted’s request to lift the stop-work order while its suit against the government goes forward, and work has resumed on Revolution Wind. In fact, in November, the administration missed its chance to appeal Lamberth’s order, although it remains just as insanely devoted to favoring oil and gas over renewable energy.

As for Monday’s decision overturning the Wind Order, the White House’s first response was, as always, to whine. White House Spokesperson Taylor Rogers groused that darn it, that nasty old Joe Biden had given wind preferential treatment while being unspeakably cruel to fossil fuels, which is a difficult lie to reconcile with the fact that US oil production reached historically high levels during the Biden administration.

Still, Rogers, like every other Trumper, offered the same line every other administration hack does on any energy story, proclaiming that “President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security.” Why no, Rogers didn’t say anything specific about the ruling or whether the administration will try to pursue the case in the Supreme Court.

That’s virtually the same as the non-answer that fellow spokesbot Anna Kelly offered last month when asked if the administration would appeal to try to stop Revolution Wind: “In just a few months, President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restored American energy dominance,” blah blah blah, with no mention of the wind farm or the judge’s decision.

Now that Judge Saris has deflated Trump’s Wind Order, states and companies will still need to sue to move wind projects forward, causing costly delays and probably killing some projects altogether, so progress will remain slow. US offshore wind may remain stymied until Trump is out of office, putting us farther and farther behind the rest of the world, which is all in on renewables. All the more reason to keep up the pressure to retake Congress and fight Trump’s climate stupidity at every step. For now, at least, states that want cleaner, more affordable energy for the long term have one less roadblock in their way.

That will include electric vehicles, many of which were leased during the tax credit era.

Coupled with depreciation, this means that a giant supply of low-mileage EVs are hitting dealer lots, many with excellent range and outstanding features.

Some people say that given recent trends, the auto industry bet wrong on electric vehicles. I see things differently. I think it bet wrong on high prices.

New car prices skyrocketed to around $50,000 this year, and EV models went even higher, especially after the $7,500 federal tax credit vanished. You can blame a number of trends for this. Inflation is certainly one of them. But in general, automakers looked at the car-buying trends of the 2010s—when Americans kept going bigger and better and nicer—and anticipated they too could keep going up and up forever.

Today, with interest rates still high and amid persistent inflation, people feel differently about new car purchases. More than ever, they're after a good deal. And in 2026, the used EV market seems poised to give it to them.

New data from the car-buying website Edmunds indicates that next year will see a surge in off-lease vehicles returning to the market. ""The sharp drop in leasing activity in 2022 left 2025 with unusually thin inventories of lower-mileage, near-new vehicles, limiting affordable choices for many shoppers,"" Edmunds analysts said. ""As leasing began to recover in 2023, the resulting 2026 lease returns will start to help fill a gap that was especially visible in 2025.""

If you want numbers around that, Edmunds estimates that around 400,000 more lease returns will return to the market in 2026. ""A healthier flow of off-lease returns will give consumers more flexibility—especially those priced out of the new-vehicle market or looking to avoid today's higher monthly payments,"" analysts said.

They don't say this explicitly, but I'll take things a step further: it's about to be a great year to get an awesome, affordable used EV.

As Edmunds notes in that data, about 71% of EVs sold in recent years were leased. This stemmed from a quirk in the EV tax credit rules: to qualify for the full $7,500, a car had to be built in North America—but if it was leased, any EV qualified for the credit regardless of where it was made. And carmakers started offering obscenely cheap lease deals just to entice people to go electric. Thus, nearly everyone who got a new EV in recent years leased it (including yours truly).

But since most lease deals are two or three years long, many of those EVs are due back next year (also including yours truly's car). And EV depreciation has been unfortunately steep—about 13% or more than gas cars, in part because there's no standard to evaluate battery health. These initial owners' losses, however, could soon be your gain. Many well-equipped used EVs now retail for $30,000 or less, often with excellent range, tons of features and more power than a comparable gas car.

Take the Ford Mustang Mach-E, still a staff favorite after all these years. According to CarGurus data, they now sell for an average of $28,970—which made me spit out my drink when I read it. If you buy a lease turn-in, like a 2023 Mach-E Premium with 290 to 306 miles of range, with loads of tech and probably less than 30,000 miles on the odometer. Find me a gas car deal that good. I'll wait. Or you give in to your evil side and get the Mach-E GT, with 480 horsepower. Those can also be had for much cheaper than they went for originally.

Or the Kia EV6, which I have. My car was over $50,000 when I got it (thanks, cheap lease deals). Today, CarGurus says their average used retail prices are around $27,427, as of this writing. Again, that gets you into a comfortable, family-friendly crossover with excellent performance, around 300 miles of range, Tesla Supercharger access (via an adapter) and the best charging speeds in its class for less than $30 grand.

And the Tesla Model Y is still hard to beat, especially if you buy one used. Right now, CarGurus says they retail for around $29,429 on the pre-owned market, and that gets you a lot of car for not a ton of money.

But if you're new to EV-buying, you may be thinking: what about the battery? The good news is that study after study shows us that modern EV batteries hold up remarkably well. With a lease turn-in around 30,000 miles or so, it's unlikely you will see any real battery degradation—and thus, loss of range—for a long time. On older Teslas, we've seen plenty of examples getting past 200,000 and even 300,000 miles with 80% battery capacity or more. It's simply not an issue like people think it is.

The EV tax credit once included a discount of up to $4,000 for used models, but that's unfortunately no longer the case. But depreciation is still opening the door to a great deal. So if you've been putting off car-shopping until 2026, your patience may soon be rewarded if you go electric—and then you probably won't go back to gas.

This position helped my administration seize every possible opportunity to expand Virginia’s energy mix, lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy.
I also strengthened Virginia’s natural gas supplies and energy efficiency standards by advancing legislation to expand development of natural gas infrastructure and signing the Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency (CARE) Act into law.
These energy policies — spanning all manner of energy sources, from natural gas to solar and wind energy — helped lower utility bills and create more jobs in the commonwealth.
That’s the best path forward to reduce energy bills, lower the cost of living and help us successfully move toward a prosperous clean energy future.","Following their major statewide wins and historic legislative victory in November, Virginia Democrats will deliver on several policy priorities in the 2026 legislative session — with affordability as issue one.

Throughout the campaign, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and the entire Democratic ticket championed lowering costs for Virginians, especially when it comes to the commonwealth’s surging electricity demand and utility costs. Virginia currently ranks 29th in the country for electricity affordability and we import more power than any other state in the nation. At the same time, our power demands are enormous. The commonwealth boasts the world’s largest data center market with 340 facilities and, if projections hold, data center construction could triple our state’s electricity demand by 2050.

If we want to continue growing our economy, create good-paying jobs and embrace technological innovations that position us as a global leader in science and technology, it can’t come at the cost of affordability and higher electricity bills.

During my time as governor, Virginia’s economy boomed. I was proud to add more than 200,000 new jobs, significantly reduce the unemployment rate, and help implement economic policies that led to personal income increasing by nearly 13%. My administration achieved these milestones because we embraced all types of energy solutions to power our economic growth. My Virginia Energy Plan acknowledged the rapidly changing energy landscape and laid out a strategy to drive innovation in energy generation by deploying diverse fuel sources, including nuclear power and natural gas, while dramatically expanding solar and offshore wind capacity and calling for state-led efficiency programs.

To help reduce overall energy consumption, I established an executive committee on energy efficiency and appointed a chief energy efficiency officer — the first state-level position of its kind in the country — to manage the planning, implementation and evaluation of energy efficiency throughout the state. This position helped my administration seize every possible opportunity to expand Virginia’s energy mix, lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy.

I also strengthened Virginia’s natural gas supplies and energy efficiency standards by advancing legislation to expand development of natural gas infrastructure and signing the Conservation and Ratemaking Efficiency (CARE) Act into law. The CARE Act encouraged utilities to build pipelines and other infrastructure that would bring shale and coalbed methane gas to the market while keeping prices affordable for consumers. It helped reform the financial and regulatory mechanisms for natural gas utilities, delivering stronger efficiency options for Virginia consumers. These energy policies — spanning all manner of energy sources, from natural gas to solar and wind energy — helped lower utility bills and create more jobs in the commonwealth.

As our energy demand skyrockets, we must build on these efforts and there’s growing demand among Virginians for decisive action. Recent polling found that 62% of Virginia voters agree on building more natural gas plants and a majority of voters throughout the commonwealth said the price of electricity was an important factor in their vote this year, supporting a balanced approach to lower utility bills by expanding our state’s natural gas and renewable energy capacities.

New energy construction remains subject to planning, siting, permitting and building delays. But we can’t let that slow us down. Improvements to state regulatory processes that ensure safety and respect for our environment can help us move forward expeditiously to meet this critical moment and lower costs quickly.

Virginia’s unemployment rate has risen for the last eight months, and our third-quarter GDP dropped from 6.2% in 2024 to 1.7% in 2025. To keep growing Virginia’s economy, provide sufficient power to homes and businesses, and lower electricity costs, the commonwealth must diversify its energy sources — as we did when I was governor — and unlock the potential of affordable natural gas as more renewable energy sources come online. That’s the best path forward to reduce energy bills, lower the cost of living and help us successfully move toward a prosperous clean energy future.",https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2023/01/09/4473TWU2SGIYJLRPBES5IJXQXU.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2025-12-13 19:58:59.467382

Who foots the bill?,Alejandro Lazo,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-13/data-centers-for-ai-could-nearly-triple-san-joses-energy-use-who-foots-bill,"The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity.
No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers.","The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.

Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.

Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San José clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center build-out, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.

Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.

Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.

How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?

The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.

Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.

“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”

The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised.

“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years — or at all,” the office said in its commentary.

Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.

Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San José, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San José Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”

What are the environmental concerns around the data-center boom?

California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.

Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.

Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.

Ahmad Thomas, chief executive of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.

“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.

Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the the Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group.

Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?

The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.

The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.

State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.

Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.

PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology, calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.

Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San José’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.

Will data centers raise your electric bill?

California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.

PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.

Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.

“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”

Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills. A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.

“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/174ebc7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/840x441+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe4%2Fc8%2Fa658cdb947ccb55cb401c2dafacb%2Fdata-center-system.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 18:59:47.978719

European automotive supplier FORVIA and Swiss clean-hydrogen specialist H2 Energy have expanded their collaboration to accelerate the industrialisation of hydrogen supply infrastructure by jointly scaling production of Multiple Element Gas Containers (MEGCs) — large modular units used to transport compressed hydrogen safely and efficiently. The strengthened partnership means that FORVIA, which has been supplying certified 38 MPa hydrogen composite tanks, will now take on end-to-end manufacturing responsibility for complete MEGC units, supporting broader hydrogen mobility and logistics deployment across Europe.

MEGCs are key components in the hydrogen supply chain, acting as robust containerised solutions that allow hydrogen to be moved from production sites to filling stations or industrial users. The renewed agreement builds on FORVIA’s expertise in high-pressure hydrogen storage systems and H2 Energy’s operational experience running a functional hydrogen ecosystem via its Hydrospider subsidiary in Switzerland, where more than 30 MEGCs are already used daily to supply green hydrogen to 18 hydrogen refueling stations and heavy-duty vehicle fleets. Production of the full MEGC units is scheduled to begin by the end of 2025, marking a major milestone in scaling last-mile hydrogen logistics ahead of broader commercial rollouts for mobility applications.

Under the expanded partnership, FORVIA will combine its manufacturing capabilities with H2 Energy’s practical hydrogen infrastructure know-how to improve safety, quality and cost efficiency in hydrogen transport solutions. MEGCs integrate FORVIA’s composite cylinders, which already meet stringent European ADR certification standards for road transport of hydrogen, ensuring compliance with top safety and regulatory benchmarks. This means the containers can be used with confidence in pressurised hydrogen environments, facilitating the broader adoption of hydrogen fuel for industrial and mobility use cases.

The collaboration also addresses one of the key challenges facing hydrogen mobility: bridging the gap between production and consumption through reliable logistics solutions. While hydrogen refueling infrastructure continues to grow across Europe, cost-effective and scalable transport systems remain essential for ensuring consistent fuel availability, particularly for heavy-duty transport and commercial fleets. FORVIA and H2 Energy’s combined efforts aim to strengthen this supply backbone by deploying MEGC fleets that can deliver compressed hydrogen where pipelines or local production are not feasible.

In statements about the partnership, leaders from both companies highlighted its significance for the hydrogen economy. FORVIA’s Hydrogen Solutions leadership emphasised the company’s commitment to advancing safe, high-quality hydrogen transport technologies as part of a broader shift toward sustainable mobility. Meanwhile, H2 Energy’s founder stressed that integrating FORVIA’s manufacturing expertise enhances logistical efficiency and accelerates the deployment of affordable hydrogen supply infrastructure — a critical enabler of clean energy adoption across transport and industry.

Hydrogen mobility is positioned as a major pillar of Europe’s decarbonisation strategy, especially for sectors where battery electrification is less practical, such as long-haul trucking and heavy-duty vehicles. Containerised hydrogen solutions like MEGCs play a pivotal role by enabling flexible delivery models and supporting hydrogen refueling infrastructure in regions where direct pipeline access is limited or non-existent. By scaling production and streamlining assembly processes, FORVIA and H2 Energy are taking a tangible step toward overcoming logistical barriers and helping to make hydrogen a more accessible and competitive energy carrier.

The partnership also reflects a broader trend among automotive suppliers to diversify beyond traditional vehicle components and contribute to the energy transition through clean mobility infrastructure. FORVIA’s investment in hydrogen transport systems aligns with its strategy to expand its portfolio in electrification and energy management, while H2 Energy continues to grow its integrated hydrogen value chain — from production and storage to distribution and use.

Looking forward, the companies expect that rolling out standardised, certified MEGC units at scale can help meet rising demand for hydrogen logistics solutions in both commercial transport and industrial sectors. As regulators, fleets and infrastructure developers increasingly adopt hydrogen solutions, partnerships like this one could accelerate the transition to lower-carbon mobility while supporting Europe’s climate goals.",https://telematicswire.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-twfev-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:04.077718

A collision between AI data centers being built—in the current AI bubble and with full throated support by the Trump Administration—and aluminum smelters for electricity is no longer theoretical. Utilities across the United States are facing binding constraints on generation and transmission. When presented with competing requests for hundreds of MW of firm power, they are choosing the customer that can pay more, scale faster, and accept shorter contracts. That customer is almost always a data center. Aluminum smelting, which depends on cheap electricity locked in for decades, loses in that comparison even before policy enters the picture.

Primary aluminum smelting is uniquely exposed to electricity pricing because electricity is not an input at the margin. It is the input. A modern smelter consumes power on the scale of a city and must operate continuously. Interruptions damage equipment and shutdowns destroy economics. To remain viable, smelters typically need long term power contracts at roughly $40 per MWh. AI data centers, by contrast, can tolerate higher prices, shift loads geographically, and monetize power into high margin digital services. That asymmetry is structural and it defines everything that follows.

The decline of US aluminum smelting did not begin with AI, renewables, or EVs. It has been unfolding for decades. In the mid twentieth century the United States was the world’s dominant aluminum producer, anchored by hydroelectric power and protected domestic markets. As globalization accelerated, smelting shifted toward regions with abundant low cost electricity and stable policy frameworks. Canada, Norway, Iceland, and the Gulf states built modern capacity while US plants aged. Rising power costs, environmental compliance requirements, and underinvestment eroded competitiveness long before today’s debates.

By the early 2020s, only four primary smelters remained operational in the United States. The remaining active smelters are in Indiana, northern New York, western Kentucky, and South Carolina, typically co located with legacy power infrastructure and long standing utility agreements that allow them to operate at all. Domestic primary production fell to roughly 700,000 tons per year while total US aluminum demand hovered around 5 million tons. Recycling expanded to fill the gap and now supplies roughly 72% of US aluminum consumption (like steel, the United States is a global leader in primary metal recycling, which is a strong positive). Net imports supply the remaining 14%, mostly from Canada. The system adapted to smelter decline through recycling and imports rather than revival of primary capacity.

In 2025, the administration sharply escalated tariffs on imported aluminum, citing national security, supply chain resilience, and domestic job protection. Section 232 tariffs rose to 25% and then to 50% for most sources. The stated intent was straightforward. Higher prices would support domestic producers and encourage investment in new capacity. Tariffs would level the playing field and bring smelting back.

In practice, tariffs were applied to a system that was already import dependent and constrained by electricity availability. Before the 2025 escalation, the US Midwest duty paid premium typically sat in the $450 to $550 per ton range, reflecting the delivered physical cost of aluminum in the United States above the global benchmark price. Within months of the tariff increases, that premium rose to roughly $1,300 to $1,900 per ton, a two and a half to four times increase over the prior baseline. Over the same period, the base LME aluminum price increased by roughly $200 to $300 per ton, on the order of 8% to 12%. The result was a sharp divergence between global aluminum prices and the delivered prices paid by US buyers, driven primarily by policy rather than underlying metal scarcity.

This price increase did improve cash margins for surviving smelters that already had tolerable power contracts. It did not address the binding constraints that prevented restarts or new builds. Electricity remained too expensive and too uncertain. Capital costs remained high. Policy risk increased rather than declined. Tariffs raised the price signal without changing the underlying feasibility of investment.

The first industries to feel the impact were those that buy large volumes of aluminum and operate on tight margins. Automotive manufacturing sits at the center of that group. Modern vehicles contain increasing amounts of aluminum to reduce weight and meet efficiency targets. EVs contain more aluminum than internal combustion vehicles because battery packs, structures, and thermal systems demand it. When delivered aluminum prices rise by $800 to $1,500 per ton, the added cost per vehicle ranges from $150 to $400 depending on design.

Automakers cannot fully absorb those increases. They respond by delaying model launches, reducing incentives, substituting steel where feasible, and passing costs to consumers. For EVs, where price parity remains fragile, aluminum inflation slows adoption and undermines competitiveness. Tariffs that were meant to support domestic manufacturing end up raising input costs for one of the country’s largest manufacturing sectors.

Grid infrastructure and electrification face similar pressure. Aluminum is embedded in transmission lines, substations, transformers, and renewable energy structures. Materials often account for 20% to 30% of transmission project costs. When aluminum and related metals become more expensive, utilities must either raise rate cases, delay projects, or scale them back. Regulatory approval takes time and cost recovery is partial. The result is slower grid expansion and higher electricity bills over time.

Renewable energy projects absorb these costs as well. Solar frames, wind components, and balance of system equipment all rely on aluminum. While aluminum is not the dominant cost driver for renewables, it is a meaningful one. Rising materials costs compound existing supply chain and permitting challenges. Deployment slows at the margin, especially where power purchase agreements were bid at tight prices.

Packaging and consumer goods also feel the impact, though the per unit effect is smaller. Beverage cans, appliances, and household products incorporate large volumes of aluminum. Higher costs are passed through gradually to consumers. Each item increases by cents rather than dollars, but the effect is broad and persistent.

Substitution provides only partial relief. Steel can replace aluminum in some automotive and construction applications, but weight penalties, corrosion risks, and performance limits constrain that option. Composites and plastics have already displaced aluminum in many uses and face sustainability and recycling challenges of their own. In critical applications such as power transmission, aerospace, and heat exchange, aluminum has no practical substitute. Higher prices do not eliminate demand. They shift costs through the system.

Proponents of tariffs argue that these costs are a temporary price worth paying to rebuild domestic capacity. In theory, higher prices could support restarts of idled smelters and justify new investment. In reality, restart potential is limited, capital intensive, and still dependent on cheap long term power. Many idled plants are obsolete or partially dismantled. New smelters cost several billion dollars and require decades of confidence in power pricing and trade policy.

Capital markets are pricing materially higher risk in 2025, and that increase is directly linked to policy choices made by the Trump Administration. The escalation of trade tariffs, including the sharp increase in aluminum duties, has increased uncertainty around long term market access and price stability, which raises required returns for capital intensive industrial projects. Repeated use of executive authority to change trade rules has shortened investor time horizons and widened credit spreads for sectors exposed to policy reversal risk.

There is also a critical labor distinction that is often glossed over in discussions of smelter viability. The direct workforce inside operating aluminum smelters is heavily unionized, relatively stable, and largely composed of US citizens or permanent residents with long tenure and specialized operational experience. That workforce can keep an existing smelter running once it is operating.

Smelter restarts, major maintenance, retrofits, and new construction, however, rely far more on external and often non unionized labor pools. These include industrial construction crews, refractory specialists, electricians, welders, civil works contractors, and control system installers. In practice, parts of this supporting workforce have historically included undocumented immigrants or workers in mixed status households, particularly in construction, site preparation, and ancillary services. The Trump Administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement posture and expanded deportation actions have tightened these labor markets further, reducing availability, increasing wage pressure, and raising the risk of delays and work stoppages.

This raises project costs and lengthens schedules, which feeds directly into higher execution risk. For capital intensive projects with multi year timelines, this distinction matters. Even if a smelter can staff its unionized operations once running, uncertainty around the availability, legality, and cost of the broader maintenance and construction workforce further undermines investor confidence and pushes the effective cost of capital higher.

Compared with the 2010s, when stable trade policy, lower interest rates, and more predictable labor availability supported effective WACC levels in the 6% to 8% range, new US primary smelting projects in 2025 face effective WACC estimates in the 9% to 12% range or higher once policy volatility and labor constraints are fully priced. These risks compound over multi year build timelines. Even with higher aluminum prices, investors see more attractive risk adjusted returns in assets with shorter development cycles, lighter labor requirements, and clearer policy alignment, including AI data centers that are competing directly for the same electricity.

This combines to mean that restarting idled aluminum plants, something requiring hundreds of millions of dollars, or building new ones, something requiring billions, are very unlikely to reach final investment decision. The cost of capital alone raises the costs of these options by tens to hundreds of millions. This compounds the lack of competitively priced industrial electricity and the challenges with getting the skilled labor necessary for new plants. It’s much more likely that more primary aluminum smelters will close rather than new ones open, a situation directly attributable to the Trump Administration’s policies which were supposed to achieve the opposite.

The collision with AI does not end there. Data centers themselves require massive grid expansion. They need transmission, substations, transformers, and conductors to be built at unprecedented speed. Aluminum is embedded in all of that infrastructure. When tariffs raise the cost of those materials, the cost and timeline of data center electrification increase. The policy meant to assert industrial strength ends up slowing the infrastructure buildout required for digital growth.

Over time, these costs do not remain with producers. They are passed through to American consumers on staggered timelines across multiple sectors. In the automotive sector, higher aluminum input costs translate into vehicle price increases or slower price declines in the range of roughly $100 to $400 per vehicle, typically appearing within 6 to 18 months as model years turn over and incentive budgets tighten.

In beverage packaging, higher aluminum prices raise the cost of cans for soda and beer, adding on the order of a few cents per six pack or case. These increases tend to appear quickly, often within 3 to 9 months, as can contracts reset and packaging costs are passed through to beverage brands and then to retail prices.

In the electricity system, higher aluminum and metals costs raise the capital cost of transmission, substations, and grid equipment. Utilities recover these costs gradually through rate cases, leading to electricity bill increases that are smaller in any given year but persistent, often amounting to a few dollars per household per month over a 3 to 10 year horizon.

In construction, higher aluminum costs feed into windows, cladding, and structural components, contributing to incremental increases in housing costs that surface over multiple years as projects are repriced and delivered. Public budgets absorb part of the shock through subsidies and infrastructure support, which shifts costs into higher taxes or public debt over longer time frames. The incidence is delayed, spread across sectors, and difficult to trace to a single policy, but it is cumulative and unavoidable.

This pattern is regressive in its effects. Electricity and packaged goods costs represent a larger share of household spending for low income Americans, so even modest increases have disproportionate impacts. Higher beverage prices are visible and frequent, while higher vehicle prices delay access to EVs that offer lower operating costs, extending reliance on more expensive fuel and maintenance. Higher electricity rates affect all households as electrification advances and electricity becomes a larger share of total energy spending. What is framed as protection for domestic industry in practice functions as a broad cost transfer to consumers, delivered through higher prices and slower cost reductions, without producing a durable revival of domestic aluminum smelting capacity.

Beyond the current administration, the implications are strategic. Electrified economies are more productive, resilient, and competitive. They rely on abundant electricity, strong grids, and efficient materials supply chains. Policies that raise the cost of electrification inputs while failing to resolve core constraints slow the transition to an electrostate. Even if future leadership shifts course, the lost time and deferred investment compound.

A coherent strategy would need to align power policy, transmission buildout, trade stability, and targeted industrial support. It would need to recognize that electrons, capital, and skilled labor are the real bottlenecks. Blunt price levers applied to one part of the system ripple outward in unintended ways. The experience of 2025 shows that raising aluminum prices does not rebuild smelting, but it does raise costs across the economy.

Electricity will continue to flow to the highest value uses. Markets will keep choosing data centers over smelters when power is scarce. Unless policy addresses physical realities rather than price signals alone, Americans will continue paying more without securing the industrial future those costs were meant to buy.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_9kpu1f9kpu1f9kpu-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:15.005471

The minister for resources, Madeleine King, this week announced five new areas in the Otway basin, stretching from waters off the south-west coast of Victoria to the ocean west of Tasmania, would be opened up for gas exploration as part of the government’s future gas strategy.

As cabinet deliberates over a major intervention into the east coast gas market, including a gas reservation, King said unlocking new supplies would help contain gas prices and avert potential shortfalls forecast for the end of the decade.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said in a statement.

The announcement comes just days after the Victorian government opened tenders for gas exploration in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

The Australian Greens and the Wilderness Society have sharply criticised the federal government’s move, warning the search for new gas supplies would worsen the climate crisis and endanger marine wildlife.

“Labor’s new ocean acreage handout is an environmental betrayal and an early Christmas gift to the fossil fuel companies driving the climate crisis,” the Greens’ resources spokesperson, Steph Hodgins-May, said.

The party’s oceans spokesperson, Peter Whish-Wilson, questioned how opening new gas fields squared with the transition to clean energy.

“Labor’s two-faced climate act is wearing thin,” he said.

The Wilderness Society’s fossil fuel industry campaigner, Fern Cadman, said the waters earmarked in the latest acreage release were “wholly unsuitable” for gas exploration.

“It’s deeply disturbing that while parts of our country are on fire, fuelled by climate heating and burning of fossil fuels, the Albanese government is mindlessly paving the way for new gas drilling. Australia is meant to be on a path transitioning away from fossil fuels, not opening the door to brand new gas,” Cadman said.

King said the five new areas – all in commonwealth waters – had buffer zones to protect marine park boundaries.

Public consultation on the five zones is open until 6 February, with applications for exploration permits closing on 30 June.

The announcement comes as the Albanese government prepares to release the findings of a six-month review of the east coast gas market, which is widely expected to recommend establishing a new scheme to force producers to reserve supplies for domestic use.

Cabinet ministers are also reportedly considering bulk-buying gas and selling it to businesses at discounted rates to prevent the closure of struggling manufacturers.

Ahead of the review’s release, a coalition of environmentalists, inequality advocates and clean energy groups issued a statement opposing new taxpayer subsidises for gas companies, which they said have been “allowed to plunder Australia’s public resources without accountability for too long”.

The nine organisations backed a 25% tax on gas exports, an Australian Council of Trade Unions’ policy that has been championed by the Greens.

“Australia’s focus on gas exports has tripled domestic gas and electricity prices driving up inflation and household bills,” said Australian Council of Social Service climate and energy program director Kellie Caught, whose organisation was among the nine groups.

“The government must implement gas export market controls and avoid options that effectively subsidise gas companies or incentivise new polluting gas production.

Just as importantly, it positions New Mexico to attract billions in clean energy investments flowing to states with strong, consistent climate rules.","Here in New Mexico, we take care of our families, our communities, and our unique way of life. It’s who we are. From the acequias that feed our fields to the small businesses that anchor our towns, New Mexicans know that when one of us is struggling, all of us step up. That spirit is what has sustained us through fires, floods, droughts and economic hardship and it’s the same spirit we need now as we confront the growing costs of a warming climate.

Because the truth is undeniable: Climate change is already reshaping daily life in New Mexico.

In the last fiscal year alone, our state spent more than $256 million responding to climate-driven disasters — from wildfires to flooding — through emergency executive orders, and this year the trend has been no different. Scientists and fiscal experts recently warned lawmakers that if we fail to act and prepare, climate-related losses could reach one-third of New Mexico’s annual budget by 2040. That would mean fewer dollars for the things we care about most: our children’s education, future infrastructure needs like roads and drinking water systems, affordable health care and the essential services that keep communities safe.

These aren’t abstract projections, they’re lived experiences happening today.

In Mora and San Miguel counties, the Calf Canyon/Hermits Peak Fire burned for nearly five months, destroying more than 630 homes and causing over $4 billion in damages. In Ruidoso, families endured the worst wildfire in their history, only to be hit again by catastrophic flooding that damaged hundreds more homes. Our ranchers have watched 20% of the state’s grazing lands disappear to heat and drought since the 1970s, and homeowners and communities statewide are facing double-digit insurance increases and dried out wells as the impact of extreme weather expands.

But New Mexicans don’t back down from big challenges. We meet them with resilience, responsibility and a commitment to protect what we love. That’s why we must commit to an economy-wide path to addressing the pollution that is causing our climate to change at a rate that’s outstripping our ability to adapt.

We’ve already taken strong steps. Our state passed the Energy Transition Act, adopted nation-leading methane rules and expanded renewable energy production. Thanks to these efforts, New Mexico is now a national leader in wind and solar, with clean-energy job growth outpacing the rest of the economy.

But our current goals to cut climate-damaging pollution rely on an executive order that can change with political winds. Families, workers and businesses deserve stability they can count on.

The Clear Horizons Act, introduced this year, provides that certainty. It codifies our 2050 net-zero targets into law, ensuring we have a real plan to reduce harmful pollution and protect the health, safety and economic security of New Mexicans. It gives state agencies the tools they need to track progress, address gaps and hold the largest polluters who emit over 10,000 tons of harmful pollution a year accountable.

Just as importantly, it positions New Mexico to attract billions in clean energy investments flowing to states with strong, consistent climate rules. That means new opportunities for working families: from solar installation and battery storage to energy-efficient construction, manufacturing and land restoration projects.

Next legislative session, let’s come together — urban and rural, northern and southern, conservative and progressive — and choose once again to take care of each other and our future by passing the Clear Horizons Act.",https://image.abqjournal.com/2938636.jpg?imageId=2938636&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-12-13 15:58:26.850808

This Insight addresses changes to IRA tax credits for electric vehicles, building energy use, and clean fuel production.

Electric Vehicles

The OBBBA repealed three electric vehicle (EV) tax credits originally enacted or expanded in the IRA, as described in Table 1.

The OBBBA terminated these credits for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. In August, the IRS announced that it would interpret the term ""acquired"" to mean ""paid for,"" such that if an individual purchases an EV before October 1st, then takes possession of the vehicle at a later date, that individual will be eligible for a tax credit.

The OBBBA also repealed the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (AFVRPC). Prior to the enactment of the IRA, the AFVRPC subsidized 30% of the costs of installing refueling equipment for alternative fuel vehicles, with a maximum credit of $30,000 for businesses and $1,000 for individuals; the credit originally expired at the end of 2021. The IRA reinstated the AFVRPC through 2032, made EV charging equipment eligible for the credit, and increased the maximum business credit to $100,000. The OBBBA terminated the AFVRPC for property placed in service after June 2026. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) projects that repealing the credit will increase federal revenues by $2.0 billion during fiscal years 2026-2034.

Residential and Commercial Building Energy Use

The OBBBA repealed three tax credits and one tax deduction for building energy use that were previously modified by the IRA. The three credits previously expired at the end of 2021 and were reinstated by the IRA in 2022.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) subsidizes 30% of the costs that individuals bear for purchasing, assembling, and installing solar electric panels, geothermal heat pumps, and other renewable energy equipment at their residences. The IRA originally extended the credit through 2034, but the OBBBA repealed the RCEC for all equipment completing installation after December 31, 2025.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) subsidizes 30% of the costs of purchasing and installing energy-efficient equipment at their homes. Annual credit amounts are limited to $3,200 per taxpayer and generally to $600 per item, with some exceptions. The EEHIC was increased to its current amounts and extended through 2032 by the IRA. The EEHIC's repeal in the OBBBA is worded somewhat ambiguously, but appears to indicate that property placed in service after 2025 will be ineligible for the credit.

Contractors may claim the Credit for Construction of Energy-Efficient New Homes (CCEENH) for building and selling new energy-efficient homes. The IRA increased the credit's maximum value from $2,000 to $5,000 per home and changed the credit's expiration year to 2032. The OBBBA terminated the CCEENH for homes acquired after June 30, 2026.

Finally, the OBBBA terminates the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (EECBD) for property beginning construction after June 30, 2026. The EECBD allows businesses to deduct the costs of purchasing and installing energy-efficient equipment more quickly than they otherwise would under normal tax rules. The IRA made the deduction more generous, although it had low take-up.

The JCT projects that, through the end of FY2034, federal deficits will be reduced by $77.4 billion due to repeal of the RCEC, $21.2 billion due to repeal of the EEHIC, $5.4 billion due to repeal of the CCEENH, and $134 million due to repeal of the EECBD.

Clean Fuel Production

Prior to the enactment of the IRA, there were separate federal tax credits for biodiesel, biodiesel mixtures, agri-biodiesel, renewable diesel, second-generation biofuel, mid-level ethanol blends, alternative fuels, and alternative fuels mixtures. The IRA added a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), then scheduled the SAF credit and all other fuel credits to expire at the end of 2024. The IRA consolidated these provisions into a single tax credit, the Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC), starting in 2025. CFPC amounts scale up or down according to a fuel's global warming potential, but had maximum values of $1 per gallon for highway vehicle fuel and $1.75 per gallon for aviation fuel.

The OBBBA reinstated the small agri-biodiesel producer credit between July 2025 and December 2026. The OBBBA doubled the credit's value from 10 to 20 cents per gallon; made the credit transferable; and allowed credit recipients to claim the CFPC for the same fuel.

The OBBBA also made a number of reforms to the CFPC. Three of the most consequential reforms were:",https://www.EveryCRSReport.com/reports/IN12625.png,N,,2025-12-13 17:58:35.102021

In the quiet industrial town of Somerset, Massachusetts, the Brayton Point Power Station has finally gone dark. Once a towering symbol of the region’s energy might, this coal-fired behemoth ceased operations three years ahead of its scheduled retirement, marking the end of an era for New England’s coal power. As reported in a recent update from Slashdot, the plant’s early shutdown underscores a broader trend sweeping across the United States, where coal plants are shuttering at an accelerating pace amid economic pressures and shifting energy priorities. This closure isn’t isolated; it’s part of a wave that has seen dozens of facilities bow out, driven by cheaper alternatives and environmental imperatives.

The numbers tell a stark story. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, planned retirements of coal-fired capacity are set to surge in 2025, with projections indicating a significant uptick from previous years. Analysts point to a combination of factors: the plummeting costs of natural gas and renewables, stringent emissions regulations, and a market increasingly favoring cleaner sources. In states like Washington, the last remaining coal plant, operated by TransAlta, was slated for closure this year but has instead pivoted to natural gas under a new agreement with Puget Sound Energy, as detailed in a report from Washington State Standard. This transition highlights how some operators are adapting rather than fully decommissioning, yet it still signals coal’s diminishing role.

Beyond individual plants, the ripple effects are profound. Coal once powered nearly half of America’s electricity, but its share has dwindled to around 13% in 2025, down from 51% two decades ago. Posts on X from energy analysts reflect a mix of sentiment, with some users noting the inevitability of this shift while others decry the loss of jobs in coal-dependent communities. The closures are not just about environmental wins; they reshape local economies, forcing workers to retrain or relocate as the industry contracts.

Shifting Winds in Energy Production

The pushback against coal’s decline has gained traction under the current administration. President Trump’s policies aim to bolster fossil fuels, including efforts to relax air pollution limits and stem plant closures. A Politico analysis reveals how the surge in electricity demand from data centers, fueled by the AI boom, is granting some coal plants a temporary reprieve. States are delaying retirements to meet this hunger for power, even as pollution levels tick upward—a reversal of the downward trend in emissions seen in prior years.

This lifeline, however, may be short-lived. The newest major coal plant in the U.S., plagued by operational failures, remains offline until 2027, according to insights from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. Such setbacks underscore the unreliability and high costs of maintaining aging infrastructure. Meanwhile, international developments add pressure; South Korea’s announcement at the COP30 climate conference to phase out all coal by 2040 has alarmed exporters like Australia, as covered in The Guardian, signaling a global retreat from coal that could further isolate U.S. holdouts.

On the domestic front, regulatory bodies are navigating a delicate balance. In West Virginia, the Public Service Commission has stated it has no plans to approve shutdowns of coal-fired plants, emphasizing the need to maintain grid reliability amid rising demands. A recent WV MetroNews report quotes officials warning that replacing coal too hastily could lead to blackouts, especially as renewable integration lags in some regions. This stance reflects broader tensions between energy security and sustainability goals.

Economic Ripples and Job Market Shifts

The human cost of these closures cannot be overstated. Communities built around coal mining and power generation face uncertain futures. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the retirement of plants like Homer City has led to hundreds of job losses, compelling local governments to seek federal aid for retraining programs. Economists estimate that the ongoing phaseout could eliminate tens of thousands of positions by 2030, though new opportunities in renewables and natural gas are emerging to fill some gaps.

Yet, the transition isn’t uniform. While some states accelerate closures, others, influenced by the Trump administration’s “market-based” plans, are crafting strategies to keep plants operational longer. A piece from Energy Connects details how these initiatives aim to boost electricity supply before a full pivot to alternatives, potentially delaying the inevitable by a few years. This approach contrasts with historical trends; back in 2021, Reuters noted plans to retire over 6,100 megawatts of coal capacity, a figure that has only grown as economic realities bite harder.

Global comparisons provide further context. Asia’s major economies, including China and India, have outpaced the U.S. and Europe in cleaning up their power sectors this year, according to a Reuters report. This divergence highlights America’s slower progress, partly due to political resistance and the AI-driven demand spike that has prompted 15 coal plants to delay retirements since the election, as analyzed by DeSmog in recent X discussions and their publications.

Technological Pressures and Grid Challenges

The rise of artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword for coal. Data centers’ insatiable appetite for power has led to unexpected extensions for some facilities, but it also exposes the grid’s vulnerabilities. Posts on X from industry watchers, such as those discussing the 47% decline in U.S. grid reliability under past restrictive policies, underscore the urgency of diversification. One user highlighted how China’s addition of 243 coal plants in 2024 contrasts with America’s closures, raising questions about competitive energy strategies.

Technological failures compound the issue. The offline status of the nation’s newest large coal plant until 2027, as per the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, illustrates the maintenance challenges and high costs that make coal less viable. Operators are grappling with outages and repairs that erode profitability, pushing more toward retirement.

Looking ahead, projections from S&P Global, echoed in X analyses from years past, suggest coal’s share could plummet to just 5% by 2030 from 22% today. This forecast aligns with the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s outlook, which anticipates coal dropping to 7% of generation by 2035 even without stringent EPA rules, as noted in recent posts by energy commentators.

Policy Crossroads and Future Trajectories

At the policy level, the Trump administration’s relaxation of pollution controls, as explored in Politico, allows dirtier operations to persist, but environmental advocates argue this delays necessary innovation. The interplay between federal directives and state actions creates a patchwork of outcomes, with places like Washington opting for gas conversions while others cling to coal.

Economic modeling adds another layer. Analyses of initiatives like Project 2025 indicate potential job losses and GDP hits in states reliant on coal, with Pennsylvania facing up to 37,700 job cuts and billions in economic drag by 2030, according to reports shared on X. These figures emphasize the need for balanced transition strategies that mitigate harm to workers.

Internationally, the Guardian’s coverage of South Korea’s 2040 phaseout serves as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers, illustrating how swift commitments can reshape export markets and global supply chains. Australia’s coal industry feels the pinch, a reminder that America’s decisions ripple outward.

Balancing Reliability and Renewal

As closures mount, the focus shifts to grid stability. Officials in West Virginia, via WV MetroNews, stress keeping plants open to avoid disruptions, especially with data center growth straining resources. This sentiment echoes across X, where users debate the merits of coal versus renewables in maintaining baseload power.

Innovations in energy storage and transmission could ease the shift, but implementation lags. The Washington State Standard’s report on TransAlta’s gas switch exemplifies adaptive strategies, potentially serving as a model for other regions.

Ultimately, the story of America’s coal plants is one of inexorable change, driven by market forces, technological advancements, and policy evolutions. While some facilities gain brief extensions, the trajectory points toward a coal-free horizon, reshaping the nation’s energy framework for generations to come.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-3784-1765649797.jpeg,N,,2025-12-13 19:59:17.804791

Ford and SK On formed BlueOval SK in 2021 to build three battery plants: two in Kentucky and one at Ford's 6-square-mile manufacturing site in rural West Tennessee. The plants represent a combined $11.4 billion investment.

Under the mutual restructuring agreement announced Thursday, a Ford subsidiary will take full ownership of the Kentucky battery plants, and SK On will own and operate the battery plant in Tennessee, according to a statement from SK On. The agreement is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to be complete by the first quarter of 2026.

The agreement allows SK On to ""improve its operational efficiency"" and ""respond more effectively to evolving market dynamics and diverse customer needs,"" the company stated.

The start of production at the Tennessee battery plant ""remains flexible at this time, as it's tied to the ownership transition,"" an SK On spokesperson said Thursday.

BlueOval SK External Affairs Director Keli McAlister wrote in a statement that the company is aware of SK On's announcement and BlueOval SK is ""working with both of our parent companies to determine what this means for BlueOval SK.""

A representative for Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

State officials are keeping a close eye on the arrangement because of a nearly $1 billion investment in BlueOval City.

""We are aware of Ford and SK On's decision to end their U.S. battery joint venture. However, this corporate decision does not change or diminish the commitments made to West Tennessee,"" the state's Department of Economic and Community Development wrote in a statement. ""The jobs, investment and long-term, generational impact promised to the region remain on track.""

Ford has pushed back its start date for mass production at the BlueOval City campus twice over the last two years amid a shifting electric vehicle market.

The industry has faced heightened political turbulence as President Donald Trump's administration targeted Biden-era electric vehicle funding and tax credits.

As of August, Ford plans to start mass production of its next-generation electric pickup truck in 2028, three years after its initial production goal of 2025.

SK On ""plans to focus on profitable and sustainable growth in the U.S. by supplying electric vehicle batteries to Ford and various customers, as well as energy storage systems, from its Tennessee plant,"" the company stated.

It emphasized its ongoing commitment to the Tennessee plant, stating the facility is a ""cornerstone of its expanding U.S. advanced battery manufacturing capabilities and production.""

SK On will ""maintain its solid strategic relationship with Ford going forward,"" as the Tennessee battery plant is on the Ford campus.

When the BlueOval City project was announced in 2021, it received nearly $1 billion in state economic incentives contingent on creating 5,760 direct new jobs over a 10-year period, with Ford's vehicle manufacturing plant slated to employ 3,000 of those workers. The remainder would be employed by the BlueOval SK battery plant.

BlueOval SK reported in September that it had hired 350 employees in Tennessee and 1,450 at its battery plants in Kentucky.

Ford announced a $2 billion investment in August to convert a Kentucky manufacturing plant to build electric vehicles, starting with a mid-sized electric pickup truck slated to launch in 2027.

Figueres asks the key question: Can this new exponential curve of clean energy innovation outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts?","By Paul Roberts / For The Herald

The annual United Nations climate talks (COP30) concluded Nov. 22 in Belem, Brazil, with tepid agreements for more funding to address adaptation and slow progress to reduce emissions. The agreements did not include commitments to phase out fossil fuels as demanded by many nations.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “The deal shows that nations can still come together to confront the defining challenges no country can solve alone.” But he added: “I cannot pretend that COP30 has delivered everything that is needed. The gap between where we are and what science demands remains dangerously wide.”

Nearly 200 nations sent delegations to COP30. The US was noticeably absent joining Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Still, there are reasons for hope. Huge strides are being made in clean energy innovation and economics, notably from China.

In an essay published in The Economist magazine, Christiana Figueres, Costa Rican diplomat and one of the primary architects of the 2015 Paris agreement said: “The question now is weather this exponential curve of clean energy innovation can outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts.” She went on to say: “The era when American politics could make or break global climate co-operation is over. The world is no longer waiting for Washington.”

Indeed, China is leading the world in clean energy development and technology. And they are exporting their technology, to the benefit of the Chinese economy and the global environment. The Nov. 8 issue of The Economist magazine published a “Special Report: China, energy and climate” (https://tinyurl.com/EconomistChinaReport.)

The “Leader” section of The Economist (https://tinyurl.com/EconomistChinaCleanEnergy) is quoted here: “The scale of [China’s] renewable revolution is almost too vast for the human mind to grasp. By the end of last year, the country had installed 887 gigawatts of solar-power capacity; close to double Europe’s and America’s combined total.”

The Economist report continues: “The coming-together of China’s enormous manufacturing capacity and its ravenous appetite for copious, cheap, domestically produced electricity deserves to be seen in a world changing light. They have made China a new type of superpower: one which deploys clean electricity on a planetary scale.”

China is on track to meet or exceed its emission reduction targets set under the Paris agreement. The COP30 negotiators have taken notice. So have other nations seeking to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, seeking energy independence, and emissions reductions.

“China is exporting it’s [renewable] revolution to the rest of the world,” The Economist continues. “America’s current government rejects renewable technologies. … China is now making more money from exporting green technology than America makes from exporting fossil fuels. … In a world where China and America vie for advantage of all sorts, climate is an area where China has a particularly strong hand; and President Donald Trump has folded America’s.”

China is demonstrating that the technical capacity to reduce emissions is here now. What has been lacking is political will. That, too, is changing with the economics. The Economist reports: “The anti-emissions machine is powered by self-interest. More clean tech elsewhere lowers China’s own climate risks by reducing global emissions. At the same time it brings economic benefits. For many years countries’ economic and climate interests have often been thought to diverge. … Today the economic and climate interests of the world’s biggest manufacturer and many of its export markets are increasingly aligned.”

China is well aware of it’s growing global stature from exporting clean technology. They are developing global partnerships while the U.S. is abandoning them.

Some states are filling the vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal from climate agreements. California, (the world’s fifth-largest economy), and Washington (the nation’s fourth-largest state economy) are leaders in climate change and clean energy technology. Both were represented at COP30 and are positively engaged in trade with China.

Figueres asks the key question: Can this new exponential curve of clean energy innovation outpace the exponential curve of climate impacts? China is demonstrating that it is possible, responding at both speed and scale.

Imagine what could be done if we were to commit the same level of resources and energy currently dedicated to AI development, toward clean renewable energy and combatting climate change? China is giving the world hope, and the world — minus one — is paying attention.

Eco-nomics

“Eco-nomics” is a series of articles exploring issues at the intersection of climate change and economics. Climate change (global warming) is caused by greenhouse gas emissions — carbon dioxide and methane chiefly — generated by human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and agricultural practices. Global warming poses an existential threat to the planet. Successfully responding to this threat requires urgent actions — clear plans and actionable strategies — to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate-influenced events.",http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/heraldnet_logo.png,N,,2025-12-13 14:59:58.746664

The legislative push to streamline energy infrastructure permitting represents a significant shift in federal policy.","The U.S. House of Representatives has taken a pivotal step in reshaping the permitting process for interstate natural gas pipelines. By passing the Improving Interagency Coordination for Pipeline Reviews Act, the House aims to expedite the federal permitting process, designating the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) as the lead agency. This move is expected to streamline the often lengthy and cumbersome approval process, potentially leading to quicker development of energy infrastructure across the country. As energy demands continue to rise, this legislative shift could have significant implications for both energy companies and consumers.

Streamlining the Permitting Process

The passage of the bill by a vote of 213-184 marks a concerted effort by lawmakers to address inefficiencies in the current permitting system. Traditionally, interstate pipeline projects have faced delays due to multiple layers of regulatory oversight, particularly involving water quality certifications under the Clean Water Act. By allowing FERC to include water quality assessments in its environmental review process, the bill seeks to eliminate the need for separate state certifications, which have often been a bottleneck.

This legislative push comes amid growing concerns about the adequacy of existing infrastructure to meet increasing energy demands. With data centers and other high-energy-use facilities proliferating, the need for rapid expansion of the energy grid is more pressing than ever. Moreover, the bill is part of a broader legislative agenda aimed at reducing household energy costs, which have been on the rise. By expediting infrastructure development, the hope is to create a more reliable and affordable energy supply.

Support and Opposition

The bill has garnered support from various stakeholders, including industry groups and some policymakers who view it as a necessary step towards modernizing America’s energy infrastructure. American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers emphasized the importance of the legislation, stating,

“These bills help unlock the infrastructure America needs to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable energy.”

US Commits $800 Million to Small Reactors, Transforming Energy Landscape and Supporting Green Innovation

However, the bill is not without its critics. Environmental groups and some state governments have expressed concerns about the potential weakening of environmental safeguards. They argue that by reducing state involvement in the permitting process, the bill could lead to insufficient consideration of local environmental impacts. This tension highlights the ongoing debate between advancing infrastructure and preserving environmental integrity.

The Broader Legislative Landscape

The House’s action is part of a larger legislative effort to reform energy permitting processes. Another bill, Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today, has also passed with bipartisan support, signaling a strong desire across party lines to tackle energy infrastructure challenges. The Senate is concurrently working on its own set of reforms, focusing on amendments to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

US LNG Exports Surge to Record Highs in November, Driven by Cooler Weather and Robust Production

NEPA, a cornerstone of environmental legislation, mandates rigorous environmental reviews for major infrastructural projects. The Senate’s proposed reforms aim to streamline these reviews, potentially facilitating quicker upgrades to electric transmission lines and other critical infrastructure. As both chambers of Congress work on complementary but distinct legislative paths, the outcome could significantly reshape how energy projects are developed and approved in the United States.

Potential Impacts on Energy Costs and Infrastructure

If successful, these legislative efforts could lead to substantial changes in the energy landscape. By reducing the time and complexity involved in pipeline permitting, companies may be more willing to invest in new projects, potentially increasing the availability of natural gas and other energy resources. This could, in turn, lead to lower energy costs for consumers, who have been bearing the brunt of rising prices.

Moreover, enhanced energy infrastructure could improve reliability and reduce the risk of outages, especially as the country transitions to more renewable energy sources. However, the balance between speed and environmental protection remains a delicate one. Policymakers will need to ensure that the push for efficiency does not come at the expense of environmental standards and public health.

The legislative push to streamline energy infrastructure permitting represents a significant shift in federal policy. As the Senate and House continue to refine and negotiate their respective bills, the coming months will be critical in determining the future of energy development in the United States. How will these changes impact the balance between energy independence and environmental stewardship in the long term?

New Mexico tells a different story. Here, we’ve shown that when a state aligns talent development, policy and infrastructure, innovation becomes a powerful engine for economic growth.

Over the last few years, New Mexico has committed to a willingness to work together. Policymakers, universities, national labs and local businesses have built a foundation for a modern technology economy, one that is growing faster than many may realize. But as this new era of innovation accelerates, driven by artificial intelligence, advanced computing and electrification, the states that will lead are those that ensure they have the power and related infrastructure to sustain it.

Any long-term innovation strategy must first start with people, and New Mexico’s talent pipeline is increasingly one of our greatest strengths. Our workforce programs and higher education institutions are the engine of this effort, working hand-in-hand to prepare the next generation of innovators who will power our economy for decades to come.

The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University and New Mexico Tech are producing thousands of STEM graduates each year and partnering directly with New Mexico businesses to match degrees in fields like cybersecurity, clean energy, aerospace and advanced manufacturing. In fact, New Mexico now ranks sixth in the nation for manufacturing employment growth and has added more than 12,000 new jobs in the last year alone.

Our state is also benefiting from organizations that nurture local talent in local companies. In Albuquerque, CNM Ingenuity has helped launch hundreds of startups and placed thousands of New Mexicans into high-wage tech jobs while the Elevate Quantum Tech Hub has positioned the state as a leader in quantum information science and attracted national partners in AI, defense and semiconductor innovation. These hubs, combined with a growing network of accelerators and university partnerships, are creating opportunities that keep our homegrown talent right here in New Mexico.

To help strengthen this foundation, I was proud to champion House Bill 20, which established the Technology and Innovation Division within the Economic Development Department. The bill secured more than $90 million to support recruitment, retention and training in high-tech fields — investments that will continue to attract companies specializing in AI, clean energy, advanced computing and bioscience. These are the kinds of employers that bring not only high-paying jobs, but long-term economic stability.

New Mexico also benefits from an unparalleled concentration of scientific power. World-class research centers like Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory are anchoring billions of dollars in federal research and increasingly partnering with local businesses to translate research into commercial products, new companies and career pathways for New Mexicans. Growing companies like UbiQD in Los Alamos, Descartes Labs in Santa Fe, and RS21 in Albuquerque are just a few examples of what’s possible when federal R&D is paired with local innovation.

But leading the next generation of technology requires more than talent and R&D. It requires reliable, affordable energy. Across the country, electricity prices are rising not because of AI or data centers, but because America has under-invested in its power grid for decades. Our aging infrastructure is forcing utilities to play catch-up, and our innovation ecosystem is paying the price.

As one of the nation’s leaders in wind and solar potential, New Mexico is better positioned than almost any other state to support the growth of energy-intensive industries like data centers and AI development. With grid modernization already underway, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to build an energy backbone that supports innovation while keeping costs affordable for families and businesses.

Across every sector, New Mexico continues moving forward. Whether it’s strengthening our workforce, deepening partnerships with the national labs or modernizing our energy infrastructure, New Mexico has proven that smart, proactive policy leads to measurable economic outcomes.

New Mexico’s story shows what is possible when states take the lead: innovation thrives, jobs grow and communities benefit. As the national conversation continues, our example stands as a reminder that the future of America’s tech leadership won’t be written in Washington, but in states like New Mexico, where collaboration, creativity and long-term thinking are already shaping the next era of economic opportunity.

As Newsweek recently put it, America is “running out of children.” Pelosi’s San Francisco home is the epicenter, with children under age five in the Bay Area plunging by 38 percent since 2005.

The video briefly displays a beaming Pelosi surrounded by children on first becoming Speaker.","Since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced she will not run for re-election, retrospectives have poured in on everything from her role in passing Obamacare to her skill in stock trades. But tributes have been noticeably missing on one theme Pelosi often stresses: that “we’re here for the children,” as she put it while surrounding herself with children in a 2007 photo-op on first becoming Speaker. There are good reasons why.

In his recent valedictory, Pelosi’s successor Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) could offer only generalities about that legacy: “For the children, as she often says, Speaker Pelosi has lived out the bedrock Jesuit value of working for the greater good.” He did no better in listing her “giant and historic legislative accomplishments,” touting specifically the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan Act. Those laws include few enduring policies focused on children.

Passed during Pelosi’s first stint as Speaker, Obamacare expanded taxpayer subsidies in all directions, yet its most prominent “children’s issue” may be a guarantee of coverage for “adult children” under their parents’ policies. The law’s broader legacy includes increasingly expensive workplace coverage. “The average cost of insuring a family of four through the workplace has nearly tripled since 2005,” according to the Milliman Medical Index.

Those growing costs compound the housing affordability crisis plaguing young adults. Large numbers live with their parents well into their 30s, contributing to historic lows in birth rates and a continuing drop in children. As Newsweek recently put it, America is “running out of children.” Pelosi’s San Francisco home is the epicenter, with children under age five in the Bay Area plunging by 38 percent since 2005. According to the 2020 Census, San Francisco has the fewest children of any US city.

Crafted during Pelosi’s second stint as Speaker, the American Rescue Plan Act notably included a massive expansion of the child tax credit, which Democrats hailed as transformative for children. In promoting the expanded benefit, Pelosi boasted “As I always say, the three most important issues facing our Congress are our children, our children, our children.”

But the expansion was temporary, and provided the credit for the first time to nonworking parents, effectively reviving work-free welfare checks eliminated on a bipartisan basis decades ago. Even Democrats balked at extending it, and it expired after just one year. As Sen. Joe Manchin, then a critical swing Democrat, put it in opposing an extension, “There’s no work requirements whatsoever. . . . Don’t you think, if we’re going to help children, that the people should make some effort?”

The subsequent Inflation Reduction Act included no major policies identifiable with children. Instead, it was panned by liberal advocates for rejecting new entitlements to child care proposed by President Joe Biden. “An important group of Americans was lost in the text of the final legislation: young children,” they lamented.

Liberal children’s advocates might find other faults. A federal paid leave program for parents failed to materialize. Food stamp expansions tilted toward childless adults, not children. And while spending is not the same as effectiveness andstates pick up many education, health, and welfare costs for kids, Eugene Steuerle and Urban Institute colleagues note federal spending “on children in 2023 was 9 percent of all federal outlays.” That is “projected to decline to 6 percent over the next decade” as spending on seniors continues to soar. Meanwhile interest on the ballooning national debt is “expected to grow from 11 percent to 17 percent.” One headline summarizes the result: “Congress Has Bankrupted America’s Future.”

That bankruptcy has been decades in the making, and both parties are complicit. But the burden of soaring debt may be Pelosi’s greatest legacy for children, contradicting promises she made on becoming Speaker.

Back then she pledged “Congress will commit itself to a higher standard: Pay as you go; no new deficit spending.” Instead, her eight years as Speaker saw federal debt explode by over $14 trillion. The financial crisis and pandemic contributed, but that’s surely not the “new America” she promised future generations, which would “not burden them with mountains of debt.”

That may explain something missing in Pelosi’s own retirement announcement. In a slick six-minute video, she describes her love of San Francisco, long House service, and billions delivered to favored projects and constituencies. The video briefly displays a beaming Pelosi surrounded by children on first becoming Speaker. But in 800 words reflecting on her legacy, it’s telling that Pelosi doesn’t once mention the group she regularly calls the most important: the children.

This strategy has been driven by lower oil and gas prices, which have limited opportunities for significant profit margins.
As U.S. energy firms navigate these challenges, they must consider how to leverage technological innovations and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness.","In recent weeks, U.S. energy firms have made notable adjustments to their oil and natural gas operations, as detailed by the energy services company Baker Hughes. According to their latest report, the number of operational rigs has decreased for the second time in three weeks. This reduction brings the total count to 548, marking the lowest level since late November. These changes are occurring amidst fluctuations in oil and gas prices, prompting companies to reassess their strategies. Despite these shifts, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects an increase in crude and gas output for the coming year, indicating potential growth in production.

Fluctuating Rig Counts and Market Impacts

The reduction in the U.S. oil and natural gas rig count is a key indicator of future production levels. Baker Hughes reports that the total rig count has decreased by 6.9% compared to the same period last year. This brings the current number to 548, reflecting a broader trend of declining rig counts over the past two years. In 2024, the count dropped by about 5%, and in 2023, it saw a more substantial decrease of 20%. These decreases have been largely influenced by falling oil and gas prices, which have led firms to prioritize financial stability over expanding production.

Despite the recent downturn in rig numbers, Baker Hughes noted a slight increase in oil rigs, which rose by one to 414, the highest since November 21. Conversely, gas rigs fell by two, bringing the total to 127. Such fluctuations highlight the volatile nature of the energy market as firms navigate changing economic landscapes and consumer demands.

Price Trends and Production Projections

Analysts predict that U.S. spot crude prices will continue to decline for a third consecutive year in 2025. However, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a rise in crude output. Production is expected to increase from a record 13.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to approximately 13.6 million barrels per day in 2025. This anticipated increase suggests that while prices may remain low, production efficiency and technological advancements could drive higher output levels.

On the natural gas front, the EIA projects a significant 63% increase in spot gas prices for 2025. This rise follows a 14% price drop in 2024, which led many energy firms to cut output. The downturn in 2024 was the first since the COVID-19 pandemic impacted demand in 2020. With higher prices, producers are likely to ramp up drilling activities, potentially leading to an increase in gas production to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day, up from 103.2 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

Economic Considerations for Energy Firms

Energy companies are facing a complex economic environment as they balance production demands with financial health. The priority for many firms has shifted toward enhancing shareholder returns and reducing debt. This strategy has been driven by lower oil and gas prices, which have limited opportunities for significant profit margins. By focusing on financial stability, companies aim to secure their long-term viability in a competitive market.

Meanwhile, the anticipated rise in gas prices could offer a reprieve for producers. A higher price point might enable these firms to increase their drilling activities and production without compromising their financial strategies. However, the success of such endeavors will depend on the ability of energy firms to adapt to ongoing market changes and manage operational costs effectively.

Future Outlook and Industry Adaptation

The energy sector is at a crossroads as it contends with evolving market dynamics and environmental considerations. While projections indicate potential growth in production, firms must remain agile in response to fluctuating prices and regulatory shifts. The industry is also under increasing pressure to incorporate sustainable practices, which could redefine production methods and energy outputs.

As U.S. energy firms navigate these challenges, they must consider how to leverage technological innovations and efficiency improvements to maintain competitiveness. The balance between increasing output and sustaining financial health will be crucial in shaping the future of the industry. How will energy companies adapt to ensure resilience in the face of ongoing economic and environmental shifts?

Being polite has gotten us nowhere.” Blackburn copied The Denver Gazette a memo she sent to Gov.","Colorado residents could be paying a lot more for home energy, following the state’s decision last week to turn away from natural gas as a home cooking and heating fuel, experts said.

Some 1.9 million Colorado households warm their homes each winter using gas. That’s also how how tens of thousands of businesses heat their buildings. But that could change significantly in the near term under an order handed down by the state’s 3-person Public Utilities Commission.

Policy experts and advocates were all ears on Dec. 1, when energy regulators ordered Xcel Energy – the state’s biggest utility company – and other non-municipal utilities to slash their carbon output by 41% by 2035 as a step toward a 100% carbon-free future fired by solar and wind.

The only way to reduce carbon that much is by switching out the gas-fired furnaces, stoves and appliances of as many as 600,000 customers and changing them to electric heating. That’s according to the Colorado Energy Office, which was among two state agencies that cautioned the utility commission against its ultimate decision.

‘EXCESSIVE COLLATERAL DAMAGE‘

Some environmental activists embraced the commission’s decision, while it spawned shock and surprise among many other advocates, some of whom were confused by the order.

“This will cause excessive collateral damage for those least able to afford it,” said Sara Blackhurst, president and CEO of Action Colorado, a nonprofit community advocacy group based in southern Colorado.

​“Meeting the approved goal will be … challenging and difficult to achieve,” Michelle Aguayo, a spokeswoman for Xcel Energy, told The Denver Gazette in a written response. She added it “will increase customer costs.”

Although state legislation passed in 2021 had required any cost of carbon cutting to be capped at 2.5% of customers’ annual gas bills, sources suggested the actual costs of a conversion might easily exceed $12 billion – or higher.

News of the order happened just as Xcel warned customers of an impending major rate hike. This week, Xcel notified that it had submitted a proposal to the PUC for a 9.93% increase to take effect next summer. Small businesses would see a 9.48% rise.

Missing almost entirely from the Public Utility Commission’s order was any mention of rates or rate increases.

In the Dec. 1 order, 28 pages in length, there were three uses of the word “rate” or “rates” apart from references to “ratepayers” — utility parlance for customers.

Some advocates said the impact of such a transition would be shouldered entirely by customers.

“Who pays for those solutions are ratepayers,” a senior executive at a large utility told The Denver Gazette, who asked to remain anonymous to freely discuss the subject.

The Denver Gazette spoke with a dozen utility experts, company spokespeople, consultants, and consumer advocates, practically all of whom offered a negative assessment of the order, on whether the reduction could be carried out in 10 years and how it could be apportioned and financed.

Virtually all said they are hesitant to go on record in criticizing an order that began in the Colorado legislature and was handed down by the commission that directly oversees their industry’s operations.

‘IT’S PAID BY THE CUSTOMER’

“The biggest misdirection is in saying it is not directed at customers,” the senior executive said. “Electric costs are going up to pay for those transitions. It’s a simple understanding of how utility programs work, whether by a non-jurisdictional utility or an investor-owned or municipally-owned utility. It’s paid for by the customer.”

Those costs could be astronomical, according to experts.

The 600,000 customer figure, cited in testimony by the Colorado Energy Office in tandem with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, works out to be around a third of the state’s households using gas as their primary heating and cooking source.

Discussion of the climate goals in the order are specific to metric tons of carbon reduction, but the language gets vague as to whether customers would be required to switch out specific appliances or whether they would be entirely converted, starting with their gas furnaces.

If a conversion cost in the $20,000 range, the tab would be $12 billion.

However, that may not figure in the systemic costs of altering the gas distribution system and of gearing up electric production, transmission, and supply to meet any jump in demand, experts said.

Meanwhile, experts are frank in admitting there is little evidence that customers are anxious to have their gas ranges converted to electric or their heaters switched out for ground-source electric heat pumps.

“What if the consumer says, ‘I’m good with what I have?’” the senior utility executive asked.

The order also brings into question what responsibilities utilities have to their customers – for whom they are supplying a popular commodity, the executive added.

A source familiar with the commission’s internal workings who declined to be named questioned the origins of the 41% reduction figure, suggesting it seems arbitrary and in conflict with the enabling legislation.

This source noted that the major affected utilities had each submitted pleadings, and all had effectively countered that the approach isn’t realistic in a 10-year timeframe.

UTILITIES SOUGHT LOWER TARGETS

In pleadings leading up to last week’s decision, Dallas-based Atmos Energy, which supplies gas to some 129,000 Colorado customers, asked that the target be held at 22%, which was specified for 2030 in the original Senate bill requiring utilities to create “clean heat plans.”

Atmos told the commission it has an “overarching duty to ensure just and reasonable rates for customers,” adding higher target levels failed to acknowledge that customers continue to demand natural gas as a fuel. Even meeting the lower target by 2030, the company said, would require average annual costs of $55 million.

When asked about the decision, Atmos would only tell The Denver Gazette that its 2024 clean heat plan focused primarily on incentives to help customers improve the efficiency of their existing appliances, and that the company is working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while also prioritizing safety, “energy choice,” affordability, and reliability.

Atmos serves customers in areas including Greeley, Steamboat, Craig, Salida, Gunnison, Canon City, Lamar, and Durango.

In like manner, Black Hills Energy, which serves some 200,000 gas customers in southern Colorado, pleaded that recent targets are not achievable without “incredible investments.” Black Hills added that baseline data used by the commission in setting the new requirements are no longer accurate due to significant growth.

Following a query about the decision, a Black Hills representative would say only that the new reductions are significantly greater than what the legislature originally required, and that the company would balance state policy requirements with customer affordability.

“Recent survey results show that 90% of our natural gas customers value the ability to choose their energy source, and we will continue to advocate for their interests, “ Black Hills added in a written statement to The Denver Gazette.

Xcel Energy’s Aguayo told The Denver Gazette that her company, with 1.5 million gas customers in the state, is charting a similar course.

“With the support of state agencies, we brought forward a reasonable proposal to balance emissions reductions and affordability,” she said in her written reply.

‘MORE AGGRESSIVE GOALS’

“As our current plan shows, the overwhelming majority of participating customers are choosing natural gas as their backup fuel source, and the shift to these more aggressive goals is not in line with customer expectations, thereby creating achievability and feasibility concerns for the future,” she added.

Using natural gas power plants to replace older coal-fired plants has been widely credited for a major decline in carbon emissions across the U.S. over the past decade. Gas emits around half the carbon dioxide per unit of energy, compared to coal as a fuel. ​

Some environmental advocates have long sought to eliminate fossil-fired energy, including natural gas, as the source to power homes and industries. They have argued that newer technologies – notably wind and solar, backed by batteries – have become cheaper over time, and Colorado should fully embrace them quickly as they are better for the environment and human health.

Critics of that transition have countered that it is happening too quickly – and that low-income residents will ultimately bear the cost of that rapid change in jobs lost and higher energy bills.

Multiple sources suggested that gas household customers and apartment renters have little or no awareness of the major changes that could soon be headed their way – or of the possible rate impacts.

Sources also pointed out that the state’s own agencies had advised the commission to accept a lower target.

The Colorado Energy Office and the Department of Public Health and Environment originally proposed a reduction of 41% across the three gas utilities by 2035. But the agencies later changed their target, suggesting 31%.

Achieving the higher target, they testified, is questionable “in a setting where the uptake rate is low” and where 600,000 customers would have to fully electrify – requiring a switch to electric water heating, cooking, and clothes drying, in addition to space heating.

Most electrification to date had been “partial electrification,” the agencies told the commission, where customers switch over some appliances while leaving others.

“If the trend of partial instead of full electrification continues, the required number of customers adopting electrification to reach the 41% target would likely be much higher than 600,000,” the agencies added.

They recommended more study to determine whether even a 31% reduction would appear ambitious.

The Denver Gazette spoke with Will Toor, executive director of the Colorado Energy Office, about the change in direction and whether he was surprised the commission had adopted the steeper carbon reduction goal than the agencies recommended.

“We certainly respect the decision the PUC made,” Toor said.

He added that the picture would become clearer as cost trends are revealed and as more is learned about whether new measures to recover lost methane can help meet the reductions.

‘CRACY REAL QUICK’

“Utility costs are at the top of mind on both the electric and gas sides,” Toor added. “If it brings on a lot of demand and they need to be building new transmission lines, it can certainly affect rates. But a lot of upgrades are needed to distribution systems just because they are old.”

The Denver Gazette asked whether wind and solar, growing as a share of the grid’s capacity in Colorado, could actually be relied on to pick up demand in a major switch from gas.

Toor replied that a switch to greater electric might rebalance the annual demand of electric customers away from summer, when cooling demand peaks. But the supply side, he added, wouldn’t solely focus on wind and solar – but also on technologies like gas with carbon capture, geothermal, and small modular nuclear reactors.

However, the senior utility executive who spoke anonymously is less sanguine about a turnover.

“It gets crazy really quick. Every customer participates in those costs,” the executive said, musing over how a utility would pick which customers need to move over to electric.

The executive questioned whether broader costs of those utilities covered by the PUC action are being taken into account, including retrofitting their existing services where their territories for gas don’t necessarily align with service for electric.

“The system is sized to meet the load,” the executive added. “To retro existing service will be very expensive, and that’s been completely overlooked.”

That executive suggested that market considerations — the willingness of customers to cooperate and the workforce availability to carry out conversions — have not been well evaluated.

“If it’s desirable to drive customers to an all-electric economy, the best way to incentivize that is to make it as affordable as possible, but Colorado has done exactly the opposite of that,” the executive said.

“It’s a vanity that we can attack everything all at once and assume it will be free.”

Meanwhile, the cost implications arrive at a moment when Colorado’s job market could be headed for decline after a decade of growth. Latest jobs data shows the state continuing to show better than average employment.

However, unemployment is running above average in some areas, warned Brian Lewandowski, who heads the University of Colorado’s Business Research Division.

With the potential for serious rate increases a possibility, The Denver Gazette reached out to all three announced gubernatorial candidates to weigh in on the PUC’s action.

Attorney General Phil Weiser’s spokesman replied he would be unable to comment at this time. Following the PUC order, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet’s campaign distributed what it calls a “cap-and-invest” plan to “Address Climate Change and Cut Energy Costs.” However, the campaign did not follow up on a conversation requesting a specific comment on the order.

‘A ONE-TWO HIT’

Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, R-Weld County, one of the Republicans running for governor, told The Denver Gazette that the PUC order is worrisome.

“A mandate to transition away from reliable, affordable, clean natural gas to unreliable and more costly wind and solar energy just doesn’t make sense,” she said in a written reply.

“The reality is pretty simple: people are going to pay more and have fewer options when it comes to heating their homes and keeping the lights on. When the PUC isn’t honest about the costs, it’s everyday Coloradans who end up feeling it the most,” she said.

Sara Blackhurst with Action Colorado noted that her organization serves counties around Pueblo, whose residents are already worried about potential job loss as its Comanche coal-fired power plant faces a scheduled closure.

The plant’s older Unit 2 generator, which had been scheduled to close this year, is being kept online after the newer, more efficient Unit 3 showed reliability issues, jeopardizing the stability of the grid.

Blackhurst said that, among the consequences of the order, is to “take effective replacements for Comanche off the table.”

“They went rogue. What they’re doing to my hometown is a one-two hit,” Blackhurst said about the PUC decision. “We’ve gone past go-along to get-along. Being polite has gotten us nowhere.”

Blackburn copied The Denver Gazette a memo she sent to Gov. Jared Polis following the PUC’s order, questioning how home heating reliability would be maintained, how the load growth would be covered, and how low-income and rural households would be protected.

She also criticized the public messaging around electrification that she says depicts electric heat pumps as a cheaper alternative to gas heat.

“The real-world data — including from climate-conscious Colorado homeowners who already use heat pumps — shows a different picture,” she said.

“If heat pumps were truly cheaper in Colorado winters, we wouldn’t have to mandate them. People would choose them voluntarily,” Blackburn wrote.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/fe69352d3b53fa58932010138ea09a3b-1024x706.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:00:11.774578

India’s electric vehicle (EV) industry is on track for a dramatic transformation as demand for EV batteries is expected to grow more than fourteen-fold by 2032, according to a new industry report. The 2025 EV Battery Technology Review Report by Customized Energy Solutions (CES) projects that annual battery demand in India will soar from around 17.7 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2025 to an astonishing 256.3 GWh in 2032 — a growth rate that reflects the rapid adoption of electric mobility across the nation. This expansion underscores not only the increasing number of EVs hitting Indian roads but also the mounting government support, emerging battery technologies, and aggressive model launches that are reshaping the country’s automotive landscape.

The CES report highlights that this growth trajectory is being fuelled by a combination of rising fuel prices, stronger consumer demand for cleaner and cost-efficient transport options, and supportive policy frameworks aimed at accelerating electrification. A compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 35 per cent is expected over the next seven years, painting a picture of one of the fastest expansions in India’s clean-energy sector. As battery demand climbs, manufacturers and investors are gearing up to scale production, diversify technology portfolios, and attract new capacity investments to meet this surge.

One of the key drivers of this transformation is innovation in battery chemistry and technology. Technologies such as next-generation LFP (lithium iron phosphate) Gen 4, advanced NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) cells, and emerging alternatives like sodium-ion batteries are poised to make EV batteries safer, more affordable, and capable of delivering better performance and longer driving ranges — all critical factors in driving wider adoption of electric vehicles in India’s diverse market. This technological evolution is expected to benefit everything from two-wheelers and three-wheelers to passenger cars and commercial EVs, making electrification more accessible across vehicle segments.

In addition to technological advances, India’s energy and automotive policy environment is playing a significant role. Government incentives, regulatory norms aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and targeted support for EV and battery manufacturing are helping to build a robust ecosystem that encourages both domestic production and foreign investments. Local battery makers are now exploring major capacity expansions while global firms look toward India as a promising hub for EV battery production and innovation.

Analysts say the anticipated increase in battery demand will have wide-ranging impacts. It is expected to spur job creation in manufacturing and related services, reduce reliance on imported energy and battery components over time, and strengthen India’s positioning in the global EV supply chain. However, meeting this demand will require sustained investment in infrastructure — including battery gigafactories, charging networks, and raw material supply chains — alongside continued research in battery recycling and sustainability practices.

For consumers, this growth may translate into a broader range of EV models, improved affordability, and better performance, making electric vehicles a more attractive choice for daily commuting and long-distance travel. Manufacturers are expected to expand product offerings in both passenger and commercial segments, responding to evolving consumer preferences and environmental priorities.

In summary, the surge in EV battery demand projected for India over the coming decade highlights a pivotal shift toward electrified mobility that promises to reshape the country’s automotive sector, drive industrial growth, and support environmental sustainability goals. With continued technological advancements and policy support, India’s EV battery ecosystem is poised for explosive growth, making it a key cornerstone of the nation’s transition to cleaner, greener transportation.",https://telematicswire.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cropped-twfev-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-13 13:59:35.836768

Thirty-six buildings, including single- and multifamily homes, the local housing authority and municipal buildings are being heated and cooled in this pilot program, which could serve as a model for the country.

Geothermal networks can extract heat stored in the Earth to warm buildings in the winter, as well as cool them by pumping heat from buildings back into the ground during the summer. This technology taps local energy that’s always available, shielding customers from fluctuating fossil fuel prices and availability issues.

Boston-based HEET.org was instrumental in driving the Framingham project. The organization aims to evolve our energy system to an affordable, clean energy model. In assessing areas for greatest climate impact, HEET elected to target building stock, which accounts for roughly 30% of all carbon dioxide emissions, explained Angie Alberto Escobar, HEET’s gas-to-geo transition director, during a recent webinar hosted by MetroWest Climate Solutions. (A link to a recording of the session is on the MCS website.)

To decarbonize buildings, HEET explored how we could most effectively achieve building electrification, the dominant strategy for reducing the sector’s carbon footprint. HEET also researched the effect of increasing demand for electricity on the electric grid and electric peaks — key energy cost drivers.

To address these issues, HEET proposed in 2017 that gas utilities, which have millions of miles of aging pipes laid under streets, replace those pipes with water-filled geothermal pipes. The pipes could transfer their energy to ground-source heat pumps, which can both heat and cool homes. Ground-source heat pumps are roughly twice as efficient as the popular air-source heat pumps, which incidentally have been outselling gas furnaces since 2022. An Oak Ridge National Laboratory study on geothermal heat pumps (Feb. 14, 2024) showed it would cost 30% less to decarbonize the grid through individual ground-source heat pumps than it would using air-source heat pumps.

Escobar explained that the team asked: “What if we took advantage of the right-of-way that the gas system currently has, used the utilities’ expertise of laying pipe in the street, and simply changed the energy transfer medium from gas to water?”

This type of geothermal network is similar to the gas system, in that it has a distribution pipe that runs down the street’s right-of-way, with service lines to each building. Instead of a gas furnace, a heat pump in each home or building is supplied with water by this distribution loop. This closed-loop system avoids the risk of dangerous leaks because the energy transfer medium is water, with a very small amount of antifreeze.

HEET collaborated with Eversource, which started work on the Framingham project in 2024. After a year of construction, the pilot is up and running. By January, HEET expects to have data on the project’s payback period and cost-effectiveness.

A key benefit of this approach is that it gives utilities a path to migrate their aging gas systems to a carbon-free energy source. Massachusetts has one of the oldest gas systems in the country, with about 17% of its underground pipes considered leak-prone as of 2024. These pipes leak methane — a greenhouse gas that has 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

Fixing these leaks is costing ratepayers about $500 million per year, according to HEET. Repair costs are expected to exceed $40 billion, which would make updating the gas infrastructure one of the most expensive projects ever undertaken by the state (by contrast, the Big Dig cost about $14.8 billion). Given these phenomenal costs, along with the state’s legislative mandate to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, it makes sense to explore alternatives, Escobar notes.

These types of projects would also allow the existing gas workforce to transition their skills. These workers, who did the majority of the work on the Framingham project, have invaluable expertise in laying and repairing pipes.

HEET is supporting another local project at the Franklin Field Apartments (129 units) in Dorchester. It will be the first networked geothermal pilot project in Boston. The project is being led by National Grid, in partnership with the Boston Housing Authority.

In addition, Escobar reports increased utility interest throughout the nation. A utility network group meets quarterly to actively explore this technology.

“This technology offers a hyper-local energy source,” she said. “We are harvesting what is already around us; it is not subject to supply disruptions or pricing variability of fuels being shipped from far away. By using the energy already around us and leveraging the systems that serve us today, we can protect future ratepayers and build the equitable, carbon-free future we all want, at the speed the climate needs.”
