With 37.4 billion tonnes of annual CO₂ emissions and the power sector accounting for 40% of energy-related emissions, the thermal power generation presents the greatest supply chain and ESG related challenge.

Developing economies still depend heavily on thermal power generation for energy security and economic growth. For example, in India alone, coal-fired power plants generate over 60-70% of electricity, supporting industries that employ millions and provide essential services to 1.4 billion people. Similar dependencies exist across other developing countries, where thermal power remains the backbone of industrial development and poverty alleviation.

This creates the ""thermal power paradox"": the simultaneous need to maintain energy security while drastically reducing environmental impact.

The Supply Chain Reality Check

While supply chain leaders focus on optimizing logistics networks and supplier relationships, the fundamental energy infrastructure supporting industrial operations continues to generate massive environmental and operational risks. A typical 500 MW thermal power plant, the type powering major manufacturing hubs across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, represents a complex supply chain ecosystem requiring 15,000-25,000 tonnes of steel, 50,000 cubic meters of concrete, and coordination among hundreds of global suppliers.

Yet these same facilities release 3 million tonnes of CO₂ annually while consuming 2.5 billion gallons of water daily, creating cascading supply chain impacts, from increased healthcare costs and agricultural productivity losses, to infrastructure damage that disrupts regional logistics networks.

The Four-Pillar Transformation Framework

A systematic approach to transforming thermal power supply chains addresses both environmental imperatives and operational reliability. This four-pillar framework offers supply chain leaders a replicable methodology for engaging with energy suppliers on decarbonization while maintaining the reliability essential for industrial operations.

Pillar 1: Emissions Control Supply Chains

Advanced flue gas desulfurization (FGD) creates new material flows. FGD implementation transforms waste streams into supply chain assets. A single FGD installation prevents 30,000 tonnes of SOx emissions annually while generating 40,000 tonnes of synthetic gypsum — creating new revenue streams for wallboard manufacturing that can generate $5-8 million annually per unit.

The supply chain complexity is substantial: FGD projects require limestone procurement at 1.1-1.3 tonnes per tonne of SO₂ removed, creating ongoing supplier relationships with quarry operations while generating gypsum distribution networks that serve construction industry supply chains. This circular economy approach demonstrates how environmental compliance can enhance rather than burden supply chain economics.

Pillar 2: Renewable Integration Networks

Building diversified energy supply chains. Strategic renewable integration creates resilient energy supply chains that reduce single-source dependency while improving cost predictability. Solar PV integration — with costs declining 85% since 2010 — enables thermal facilities to optimize generation timing, operating during peak efficiency periods while solar handles midday demand.

The procurement implications are significant: A 100 MW solar installation requires coordination of photovoltaic modules, inverters, and electrical infrastructure across hundreds of acres, typically spanning 18-24 months from engineering to commissioning. Success depends on managing fragile component transportation and synchronizing electrical grid integration with multiple technology providers.

Pillar 3: Fuel Supply Chain Transformation

Parallel fuel systems enhance supply security. Rather than disruptive fuel switching that creates supply chain vulnerabilities, parallel fuel systems enable gradual transition while maintaining operational reliability. Natural gas integration alongside existing coal infrastructure provides 50% CO₂ reduction while preserving backup fuel options.

This approach requires sophisticated procurement strategies, including long-term gas contracts, storage capacity and transportation diversity. Implementation involves complete parallel infrastructure — pipeline connections, compression stations, and treatment systems — creating redundant fuel supply chains that optimize based on pricing, availability and environmental considerations.

Pillar 4: Water Resource Supply Chains

Ecological engineering reduces resource dependencies. Phytorid bed technology transforms wastewater treatment from resource-intensive operations into self-sustaining ecological systems. These nature-based solutions achieve superior treatment performance with 60-80% lower operating costs compared to conventional systems while eliminating chemical reagent supply chains.

Implementation requires minimal ongoing inputs: Periodic plant harvesting and substrate maintenance replace chemical procurement, mechanical equipment, and high energy consumption. The approach converts waste streams into productive ecosystems that sequester carbon while generating biomass for composting or biogas production.

Supply Chain Economic Impact

Comprehensive four-pillar implementation generates profound supply chain transformation extending far beyond environmental compliance. The economic model reveals attractive returns through multiple value streams:

Direct cost optimization. Fuel efficiency improvements reduce costs by 15-25%, creating annual savings of $15-30 million for a 500 MW facility. Combined with reduced water consumption and waste disposal costs, operational savings justify implementation investments.

New revenue streams. Byproduct sales from gypsum production, renewable energy sales during peak pricing, and biomass production create additional revenue totaling $8-15 million annually per facility — transforming environmental compliance from cost center to profit contributor.

Risk mitigation. Fuel diversification, environmental compliance and community acceptance reduce regulatory, market and social risks that translate to lower financing costs and higher asset valuations.

Implementation Methodology for Supply Chain Leaders

A staged approach minimizes disruption. Successful transformation requires parallel system development that maintains operational capability while building sustainable capacity. Rather than disruptive replacement, this approach enables gradual transition as new systems prove reliable.

The five-stage methodology begins with comprehensive baseline assessment, progresses through technology integration planning and parallel system development, enables gradual transition and optimization, and concludes with continuous improvement and scaling. Each stage maintains supply chain reliability while building transformation capability.

Stakeholder ecosystem development. Transformation projects catalyze development of supporting supply chain ecosystems that create regional economic development. FGD installations support local limestone mining and gypsum processing, while renewable integration creates demand for installation services and maintenance providers that develop capabilities transferable to other projects.

The Strategic Imperative

For supply chain leaders, the thermal power transformation represents both risk mitigation and competitive opportunity. Early movers gain advantages through reduced energy costs, enhanced ESG performance, and stronger stakeholder relationships. The question isn't whether transformation will occur — economic and regulatory forces ensure it will — but whether companies will lead or follow this supply chain evolution.

The four-pillar approach provides a framework for engaging energy suppliers on decarbonization while maintaining the reliability essential for industrial operations. With global energy transformation accelerating and ESG requirements tightening, proactive supply chain leaders can turn environmental challenges into competitive advantages through strategic energy supplier partnerships.",https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2023/12/01/COAL-POWER-PLANTS-iStock--kamilpetran--623296954.jpg?height=635&t=1701447272&width=1200,N,,2025-09-15 01:57:46.871562

Solar projects are groups of solar panels used to harness energy from the sun, while wind projects include wind turbines, which are used to harness energy from the wind.

Restrictions on foreign-made solar panels The news release also announced restrictions on panels “manufactured by foreign adversaries,” which could make solar projects more expensive.","The U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, will no longer fund renewable energy projects on prime farmland, according to an Aug. 19 news release. This will prevent farmers in Iowa from installing solar and wind projects on their land.

Solar projects are groups of solar panels used to harness energy from the sun, while wind projects include wind turbines, which are used to harness energy from the wind.

Lee Tesdell, a farmer located in Slater, Iowa, and a board member for the Center for Rural Affairs, has had solar projects on his land for 10 years. Starting with just an array of six panels, he has since added 24 additional panels. He called the USDA decision “terrible.”

“It’s a sad day when Washington wants to tell us that we can’t farm the wind, can’t farm the sun,” Tesdell said.

Tesdell said many farmers have good reasons to have renewable energy projects on their land — not only for financial reasons— but also because it is a“cleaner energy source” than fossil fuels.

“It makes all kinds of sense for [Iowans] to farm the sun and farm the wind, just like we farm the soil, right?” Tesdell said.

Tesdell’s solar projects generate about 75 percent of his electricity needs for his farmstead, including his house, barn, and well.

Tesdell also said he is “grid tied,” with his electric utility company, Consumers Energy Rural Electric Cooperative — meaning the amount of energy he overproduces goes into the energy grid, leading to a reduced bill each month.

He also has a net metering agreement with the cooperative, meaning compensation for overproduction comes at a retail rate instead of wholesale price, leading to a large difference in the payback each month.

Jennifer Studebaker, interim executive director at the Women, Food, and Agriculture Network, or WFAN, described the decision as unfortunate. She said it will become costly to all Iowans if farmers are no longer able to build wind and solar projects contributing to the energy grid.

Studebaker elaborated on the financial benefit farmers can get, especially if they sell the energy they generate.

“For farmers, that $10,000 or so difference in terms of costs, that’s sometimes, if they get to keep their farm, in terms of the security that that can offer,” she said.

Emma Colman, organizing representative of the Sierra Club’s Iowa Chapter, an environmental nonprofit, said the move represents a lack of understanding of rural America.

“It is a testament to how little our current federal administration understands our state and local communities,” she said. “It ultimately is just taking power out of the hands of our communities, and that’s really disappointing.”

She said farmers should be able to make their own decisions on their property because solar and wind projects allow farmers to make a better living, and are another form of farming.

Chris Hoffman, a member of the Johnson County Solar Task Force, has been in the solar industry for 12 years. He said the federal administration has been clear they do not want to move toward cleaner energy initiatives.

“In reality, the administration just doesn’t want renewable energy projects,” Hoffman said. “This is probably a dug-up excuse for not doing so.”

Prime farmland in Iowa

According to the Clean Grid Alliance, 5,755 out of 30,000,000 acres of Iowa farmland house solar projects, which amounts to less than one percent of total farmland.

The alliance also found 17.5 million out of Iowa’s 30 million acres are considered “prime farmland,” which is defined by the USDA as “land that has the best combination of physical and chemical characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber, and oilseed crops and is available for these uses.”

U.S. Rep. Mike Bost, R-IL, sees these projects as taking up too much farmland, therefore limiting the amount of food that is grown to feed Americans.

“We shouldn’t be subsidizing solar projects on prime farmland; that land is too valuable for producing the food and fuel our nation depends on,” Bost said in the news release.

Lee Tesdell mentioned the use of agrivoltaics — defined as agricultural production underneath solar panels — as a way to further mitigate the amount of land solar projects take up. For example, he has set up a fence around his panels and allowed his sheep to graze underneath them, which he said works nicely.

He disagrees with the argument that solar and wind projects take up too much space, and said solar and agriculture can work well together in this way.

“It’s kind of a bogus argument to be honest,” Tesdell said.

Studebaker also brought up agrivoltaics as an alternative to the lack of space argument.

“What I really see as a missed opportunity by the Trump administration is recognizing that you can have renewable energy and sustainable farming working together,” she said.

Environmental impacts of wind and solar projects

Peter Thorne, an environmental professor at the University of Iowa, said solar and wind projects have little negative effect on the land they are built on. Though he mentioned farmland less than ideal for growing crops — not considered “prime farmland” by USDA standards, including land located by streams and rivers — may be a proper place for wind and solar projects.

“We really need to be thinking more smartly about how we use Iowa’s land,” Thorne said. “I think the focus should really be on carefully taking land out of production, that is, this vulnerable land, that’s erodible.”

He explained solar and wind projects, a form of clean energy, are better for the environment than fossil fuels.

“The science all points to the need for clean energy, both in terms of it being the best for the health of the ecology and human health, and also in terms of energy independence,” Thorne said. “We know that fossil fuels are going to run out, and that they are responsible for a lot of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and deaths.”

Studebaker said there are ways for farmers to mitigate any potential impacts projects could have on farmland.

“If you’re worried about erosion or movement of water, there are different things you can do in terms of planting certain types of native plants to block that and absorb more of the water,” she said.

Colman said limiting solar and wind projects will harm the land, as farmers will have to resort to using fossil fuels. She added that energy demand in Iowa and across the world is going up, and that the state must adapt to meet that demand.

“The reality is, if they aren’t investing in renewables, energy efficiency, and battery storage, then they’re going to be building new gas and coal plants across our state — and are those good for the farmland?”

It is unclear if projects on poorly graded land will continue to be approved, as the new restrictions only pointed to protection of prime farmland.

Restrictions on foreign-made solar panels

The news release also announced restrictions on panels “manufactured by foreign adversaries,” which could make solar projects more expensive.

According to the International Energy Agency, China is responsible for over 80 percent of the production of solar panels worldwide.

Studebaker said she expects this to affect farmers’ ability to purchase and install solar panels, even if the project isn’t on prime farmland.

“There may be a few US companies, but I don’t think we have the domestic industry to allow for people to buy solar panels, and especially at an affordable cost,” she said. “The ones [solar panels] being produced in China are probably the most affordable for farmers.”

David Bader, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Grassley will continue to “review the regulation to ensure the U.S. continues to pursue a strategy that supports farmers while increasing our energy savings.”",https://dailyiowan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_09_11_WindTurbine_GD_008.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 00:58:29.089976

But the sun continues to shine, and in Evanston, residents continue to install rooftop panels to turn that into electricity.

It was a year ago when Libby Hillinstalled 12 rooftop solar panels on her northwest Evanston home. We met up again in late August to find out how those panels are doing.

Hill pulled out her phone and showed us that the system had produced 6.18 megawatt hours of power since they were installed. She has paid for extra electricity just once, when midsummer heat made air conditioning unavoidable. Otherwise, she’s been paying just $19.54 a month, the minimum that ComEd charges for connecting to the grid.

She relishes checking the SolarEdge app that tracks electricity production, especially on a clear day when the panels are at their most productive. Even when she’s out of the country, she checks to see whether it’s sunny enough at home to keep the solar power humming.

But the point Hill wanted to emphasize is that she’s not alone. She mentioned several nearby houses with rooftop solar installations, and when she walked around later to confirm, she found even more.

Big trees rule out rooftop solar in many parts of Evanston. But “in my neck of the Evanston woods, I find I’m in good company,” she said. Within a few blocks, she found 12 other solar installations on houses that vary in age and style.

“Homeowners have found suitable locations for panels on house roofs to garages, sometimes sandwiched into the space where the sun reaches on an otherwise tree-shaded roof,” she reported. “Panel-covered roofs face south, east, west and in one case north, and in another case three sides of the roof except north. On my sunny late morning walk, the sun was shining on all.”

Permit applications from the City of Evanston confirm that what she’s observed in her neighborhood reflects a broader pattern. From January 2019 through August of this year, the city issued 409 permits for residential solar installations. For the five years that began in January 2019, the average number of applications per year was 60. Applications rose to 70 in 2022, the year the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law and federal tax credits for solar went into effect.

Act fast for federal tax savings

Now that the Trump administration’s budget bill has dismantled much of the IRA, tax credits for rooftop solar will expire at the end of this year instead of continuing through 2035.

Groups like Rewiring America are urging people to act fast, offering tips like this guide to using tax credits before they’re gone. Electric vehicle credits also expire at the end of September. Rooftop solar installations have to be complete and connected to the grid by Dec. 31 to qualify. (Check EnergySage for other available incentives.)

Even with these credits expiring, solar energy will remain a “hedge against utility rates, which have climbed high in recent years and are expected to rise even further as data centers demand more energy and the Trump administration stymies cheap wind and solar power,” Dan McCarthy writes for Canary Media. “Most households that install rooftop solar see their energy bills drop.”

Saving money isn’t the main consideration for everyone, Hill pointed out, and those who can afford the up-front cost have other important reasons to go solar: “People do it because it’s a good thing to do,” she said.

‘Benign and beautiful way to produce energy‘

Bill McKibben, the author of a 1989 book that raised public alarm about the perils of human-caused climate change, is spearheading plans for Sun Day on Sunday, Sept. 21. The event, a revival of sorts of the first Sun Day in 1978, which Hill remembers fondly, will be celebrated locally with events in Wilmette and at Montrose Beach in Chicago. (Find out more here.)

As McKibben said in a recent interview: “The sudden explosion of solar and wind energy over the last three years is the first time we’ve had anything that’s really started to scale in a way that might make a difference in how hot the planet eventually gets. … We have a benign, indeed, a beautiful way to produce energy, energy from heaven, not from hell.”

Drop by the Sept. 21 Sun Day event at Montrose Beach: “Over 30 groups — from solar installers and nonprofits to justice organizations and houses of worship — will share fun, easy ways to go solar, including community solar that can save you 15–20% on your electric bill.”

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?” AP",https://www.communicationstoday.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US-power-grids-strain-under-data-center-boom-forcing-strategy-shift.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 01:57:55.204424

Installed renewable capacity is expanding at record speed, spanning solar, wind, hydro, biomass, and nuclear. Yet, the true test is not how much we add, but how fully and efficiently we use what is already generated. Unless every kilowatt-hour is delivered at the lowest cost and highest reliability, capacity growth will remain a hollow statistic.

The vision must be uncompromising: Power for all Indians, of the highest quality and lowest cost. Reliable electricity is not just a household need but the foundation of industrial growth, digital expansion, agricultural productivity, and social equity. Delivering clean, uninterrupted power at globally competitive costs is both an economic imperative and a national commitment—essential to India’s prosperity and resilience.

Principles for Transformation

Eliminate power waste: Every photon, gust, or drop converted into electricity must find productive use. Curtailment of renewable energy, still common in several states, undermines both abundance and investor confidence.

Manage surges and shortfalls: AI-driven forecasting, storage, and flexible demand response can smooth out fluctuations. Without such integration, renewable power will remain prone to waste and unreliability.

End tariff distortions: Cross-subsidies discourage efficiency and deter investment. Replacing them with direct benefit transfers (DBT) to vulnerable households ensures transparent, cost-reflective tariffs that attract capital while protecting the poor.

Global standard maintenance: Poor operation and maintenance (O&M) increases outages and costs. Preventive maintenance—using AI, IoT, and drones—must replace reactive fixes, ensuring turbines, substations, and feeders meet global reliability benchmarks.

Full utilisation of assets: Idle plants and stranded assets cannot coexist with power shortages. A national dispatch system with real-time monitoring and strict merit-order discipline will ensure every plant contributes optimally.

AI-led optimisation: Artificial intelligence must permeate every function—demand forecasting, frequency regulation, market clearing, and predictive maintenance—to orchestrate a dynamic, reliable grid.

Policy Circle is now on WhatsApp. Click here to join the channel

Reach the last hamlet: Distributed microgrids—solar, mini-hydro, and biomass—must complement national transmission networks, ensuring no community is left without power.

Regional energy diplomacy: South Asia’s power future is interdependent. Hydro imports from Nepal and Bhutan, natural gas and biogas from neighbours, and cross-border grid connections with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka can create a resilient regional bloc.

Abundance as justice: The goal is not just adequacy but justice—clean, uninterrupted, affordable power delivered at globally competitive costs to every citizen.

Strategic pillars of action

Transmission: A multi-terminal HVDC overlay grid linking Rajasthan, Gujarat, Ladakh, and Tamil Nadu directly to industrial centres is essential. The 500 GW transmission expansion must be fast-tracked and monitored transparently. Cross-border HVDC interconnections will add resilience.

Market reform: Market-Based Economic Dispatch (MBED) with five-minute settlements can lower system costs. Breaking state-level scheduling silos and guaranteeing transparent curtailment compensation are critical to investor trust.

Storage and flexibility: India needs to auction at least 100 GWh of storage annually, spanning batteries and pumped hydro. Storage must be treated as infrastructure, paid for its availability and ramping services. Aligning time-of-day tariffs with renewable peaks will drive efficiency.

Tariff and subsidy reform: Direct benefit transfers can replace opaque subsidies, while national tariff rationalisation ensures fairness and stability. Cost-reflective tariffs will also align investor expectations with consumer protection.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Digital and AI orchestration: An AI-led system operator, backed by a national digital twin of the grid, can optimise dispatch and forecast demand. Real-time, open-access data will spur innovation from startups and utilities alike.

Maintenance excellence: Utilities must adopt ISO 55000-compliant asset management and global preventive O&M standards. Drones and robotics can make inspections continuous, reducing outages and costs.

Regional energy diplomacy: Hydro imports from Bhutan and Nepal should be locked into long-term contracts. India must lead in creating a South Asian Power Pool and regional green gas market, positioning itself as the anchor.

Universal access: Distributed renewable microgrids and prepaid meters must integrate rural consumers into digital markets. Reliable 24×7 power should be treated as a constitutional right.

Governance and finance architecture

A National Renewable Evacuation and Optimisation Mission (NREOM) should take single-point responsibility for integration. Financing must draw on PGCIL InvITs, sovereign green bonds, and blended finance to mobilise over $100 billion annually. Contracts must be outcome-based, with strict penalties for delays.

If executed with urgency, India can:

Eliminate renewable curtailment by 2030.

Deliver the world’s lowest cost per kilowatt-hour, anchored in efficiency.

Guarantee reliable 24×7 power to every household.

Become a net exporter of clean power, stabilising South Asia’s grid.

Lead in AI-optimised grid operations, proving industrialisation can be decoupled from carbon emissions.

Clean energy: From vision to execution

India has pledged 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030 and Net Zero by 2070. These numbers inspire confidence, but they risk becoming hollow milestones if generation is wasted, if tariffs remain distorted, and if assets are left idle. The challenge now is to turn capacity into capability—power that is fully utilised, efficiently dispatched, and equitably shared.

The first step is to eliminate systemic inefficiencies: end renewable curtailment, replace cross-subsidies with direct benefit transfers, and enforce cost-reflective tariffs. At the same time, AI-enabled optimisation must become the backbone of grid management, predicting demand, regulating frequency, and enabling market-based dispatch. Maintenance must move from reactive repair to global-standard preventive care, ensuring every plant and transmission line operates at peak efficiency.

Equally vital is the extension of abundance to every household. Distributed microgrids, supported by digital tokens and prepaid meters, can bring the remotest villages into real-time power markets. Cross-border connections with Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka can anchor a resilient South Asian energy bloc, positioning India as both provider and stabiliser.

This is not simply an energy strategy. It is a civilisational pledge—to deliver clean, affordable, uninterrupted power as a basic right of citizenship, to build competitiveness for industry, and to secure regional leadership. The test of ambition lies not in setting targets but in ensuring that no unit of power is wasted and no citizen is left in the dark.:",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/green-bonds.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 21:59:46.896683

The Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act incentives, which offered up to $7,500 in tax credits per EV, are set to expire on September 30. Analysts warn the move could sap demand and slow supply chain investments across the U.S. EV sector.

Compounding the challenge, a $4.3 billion Hyundai–LG battery plant in Georgia has been forced to push back its launch by at least two to three months after a federal immigration raid disrupted construction. The facility was expected to start supplying lithium-ion cells next year.

Hyundai and Kia are now leaning on hybrid vehicles to fill the gap. U.S. sales of their hybrids jumped nearly 48 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of 2025, reaching almost 200,000 units. But the vast majority of these cars are exported from South Korea, leaving them exposed to a steep 25 percent import tariff.

That tariff burden could grow more costly as Japan, Hyundai’s biggest hybrid rival in the U.S., prepares to secure a reduced 15 percent tariff under its trade terms with Washington. Toyota and Honda already dominate the U.S. hybrid market with a combined 68 percent share, while Hyundai and Kia trail at 12.3 percent.

Industry analysts warn the risk of a price reversal is real: Kia’s Sportage Hybrid, priced at $30,290, could overtake Toyota’s $32,850 RAV4 Hybrid if tariffs raise its sticker price to nearly $38,000, leaving Hyundai at a competitive disadvantage.

Hyundai is expected to outline a revised North America hybrid strategy at its upcoming CEO Investor Day. Market watchers say the company must emphasize durability, parts distribution, and service networks to reassure investors — and to fend off Japanese rivals poised to consolidate their lead in a post-subsidy market.

Fleet deployment target is the largest announced to date for Advanced Modular Reactors in the U.K. and could generate at least $54 billion in economic activity, creating thousands of high-quality jobs.

Deployed new nuclear capacity is set to make a significant contribution to the next wave of clean, secure electricity and high temperature heat for industry and manufacturing.

Centrica plc (“Centrica”) and X-Energy, LLC (“X-energy”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, today announced their entry into a Joint Development Agreement (“JDA”) to deploy X-energy’s Xe-100 Advanced Modular Reactors (“AMR”) in the United Kingdom. The companies have identified EDF and Centrica’s Hartlepool site as the preferred first site for a planned U.K. fleet of up to 6 gigawatts.

The agreement represents the first stage in a new trans-Atlantic alliance which could ultimately mobilize at least $54 billion in economic value to bring clean, safe and affordable power to thousands of homes and industries across the country and substantive work for the domestic and global supply chain.

A 12-unit Xe-100 deployment at Hartlepool could add up to 960 megawatts (“MW”) of new capacity, enough clean power for 1.5 million homes and over $15 billion in lifetime economic value. It would be developed at a site adjacent to Hartlepool’s existing nuclear power station which is currently scheduled to cease generating electricity in 2028. Following its decommissioning, new reactors would accelerate opportunities for the site and its skilled workforce. The site is already designated for new nuclear under the Government’s National Policy Statement and a new plant would also play a critical role in generating high-temperature heat that could support Teesside’s heavy industries.

Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026. Subject to regulatory approval, the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are already in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica said:

“Centrica is proud to be at the forefront of Britain’s clean energy transition - investing in infrastructure and jobs that meet today’s energy needs while enabling tomorrow’s ambitions. Our partnership with X-energy marks a bold step forward in delivering advanced nuclear technology that is not only scalable and secure, but also vital to clean industry and powering homes. The Xe-100 fleet will help build a resilient energy system that supports national security, affordability, and sustainability. From Sizewell C to Hartlepool, we are backing Britain’s energy future - and building it.”

J. Clay Sell, CEO of X-energy said:

“Our partnership with Centrica represents a commitment to bring X-energy's industry-leading advanced nuclear technology to the U.K. at scale. Together, we aim to build a fleet that has the ability to reliably deliver clean power, strengthen energy security, and grow the trans-Atlantic economy for decades to come. We believe Hartlepool is the right place to begin this journey, with an established industry and a base of professionals and services who can help drive the next generation of nuclear forward.”

In 2021 the U.K.’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) identified High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising advanced technology for demonstration. In 2025 X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear completed a number of year-long assessments, co-funded by DESNZ’s ‘Future Nuclear Enabling Fund’, to support the commercial deployment of Xe-100s in the U.K. Discussions are now underway with Government regarding the “route to market” in the UK, consistent with the principles set out in June for supporting privately led projects. The Government’s ongoing work to create a clear and credible pathway is instrumental in making the UK an attractive destination for investment in advanced modular reactors. Support for initial projects, and those that follow, will be decisive in unlocking the full potential of advanced nuclear for Britain’s energy future.

U.K. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said:

“This cross-Atlantic partnership demonstrates the transformative potential for the British people of US and UK businesses joining forces, with X-Energy and Centrica’s planned first project alone having the potential to create up to 2,500 good, skilled jobs, add £12 billion in economic value and generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes. By working with the US, we will reap the benefits of this golden age of nuclear, powering British homes with clean, homegrown energy, delivering well-paid skilled jobs and getting energy bills down for good.”

United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said:

“With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution. Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators. Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF in the UK, said:

“As part of its role to enable further new nuclear development in the UK, EDF welcomes the interest by Centrica and X-Energy in Hartlepool as the first site to develop this technology, and we will support the development plans as they evolve.”

X-energy’s pioneering Xe-100 advanced small modular reactor and TRISO-X fuel are among the safest and most reliable clean energy technologies.

Factors such as upfront costs and access to charging are among significant barriers to “mass adoption” of the technology, the AA said.

A survey by the motoring organisation indicated that some drivers are also concerned about battery health and the resale value of EVs.

The AA has launched an “EV readiness index” aimed at reflecting how practical and appealing EV ownership is.

Its initial rating of 47.5 out of 100 was based on factors such as:

– The average cost of a new EV across four models analysed being 27% higher than their petrol equivalents.

– Home charging being 22% more expensive per mile than petrol equivalents when the average cost of financing a home charger over a one-year period is included.

– Broken down EVs being more likely to be fixed at the roadside than petrol or diesel vehicles.

The index will be updated every three months.

The AA called for the Government to encourage more people to switch to electric motoring by considering targeted incentives for used EVs and reducing VAT for public on-street charging.

Edmund King, AA president, described the recently introduced electric car grant – which reduces the cost of some new EVs by up to £3,750 – as a “welcome boost” but warned “we need to go further to make EVs a realistic choice for all drivers”.

He said: “Drivers tell us they’re excited about going electric and they love the tech, but they’re also confused and cautious.

“Our index shows that upfront costs and charging access are still major concerns.

“Our polling also suggests battery health and resale values are still issues for some.

“Our index is an independent barometer of the issues that are either holding drivers back or propelling drivers to go electric.

“We are confident that the readiness rating will increase with more chargers, less expensive products, targeted incentives and better information.”

The Government has pledged to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030.

Battery EVs held a 26.5% share of the new car market in August, which was the highest monthly level this year.

A total of 4.1% of all licensed cars in the UK were fully electric as of the end of March.

A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “We recognise the nervousness of some drivers to go electric, which is why our electric car grant is slashing prices for consumers, giving drivers across the UK access to new electric cars for less – with 35 models now eligible.

“This £650 million scheme is helping families make the switch to cleaner cars while putting money back into the pockets of working people.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3.OTEaPbntJAY7yy93Gxgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa_viral_news_uk_120/73e7302fe950e216d61bdaf2e8e5e9c8,N,,2025-09-14 19:59:51.297836

The money will bolster the Government’s UK SHORE programme for investing in low-carbon innovation for the maritime industry. This initiative was first launched in March 2022 with an initial budget of up to £206m.

A total of £240m has been allocated through the programme to date, benefitting 200 projects across the UK, including scientific research, factory trials, real-world demonstrations and commercial trials.

The Government claims the investment has also unlocked a further £110m in direct private investment.

Previously supported projects have included the installation of electric charging points at ports for vessels. These are now in place at Cammell Laird dry dock at Birkenhead in Liverpool and various locations across the South Coast and London.

UK SHORE has also supported innovations in low-carbon hydrogen production, ammonia and methanol-based fuels and wingsail attachments for boats.

Domestic transport accounts for around 28% of the UK’s terrestrial emissions footprint. Shipping accounts for around one-fifth of that.

Private investment

Further to the Department for Transport’s funding, the UK Government has confirmed that £700m of private investments will be confirmed on the first day of London International Shipping Week this Monday (15 September).

Peel Ports will invest £300m in modernising its Liverpool, Hunterston and Great Yarmouth ports. A further £150m has been pledged by the operators of the Port of Tyne, largely to accommodate new offshore wind and manufacturing facilities.

NatPower Marine will invest £250m in shore-side power in the UK, which it claims will support more than 2,000 skilled jobs in engineering, construction, and green technology services.

The announcements come shortly after the UK Government consulted on proposed changes to the planning process for ports. Ministers want to make it easier and faster for port owners and operators to expand in order to support nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs), like large offshore wind farms.

The agreement represents the first stage in a new trans-Atlantic alliance which could ultimately mobilize at least $54 billion in economic value to bring clean, safe and affordable power to thousands of homes and industries across the country and substantive work for the domestic and global supply chain.

A 12-unit Xe-100 deployment at Hartlepool could add up to 960 megawatts (""MW"") of new capacity, enough clean power for 1.5 million homes and over $15 billion in lifetime economic value. It would be developed at a site adjacent to Hartlepool’s existing nuclear power station which is currently scheduled to cease generating electricity in 2028. Following its decommissioning, new reactors would accelerate opportunities for the site and its skilled workforce. The site is already designated for new nuclear under the Government’s National Policy Statement and a new plant would also play a critical role in generating high-temperature heat that could support Teesside’s heavy industries.

Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026. Subject to regulatory approval, the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are already in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Chris O’Shea, CEO of Centrica said:

""Centrica is proud to be at the forefront of Britain’s clean energy transition - investing in infrastructure and jobs that meet today’s energy needs while enabling tomorrow’s ambitions. Our partnership with X-energy marks a bold step forward in delivering advanced nuclear technology that is not only scalable and secure, but also vital to clean industry and powering homes. The Xe-100 fleet will help build a resilient energy system that supports national security, affordability, and sustainability. From Sizewell C to Hartlepool, we are backing Britain’s energy future - and building it.""

J. Clay Sell, CEO of X-energy said:

""Our partnership with Centrica represents a commitment to bring X-energy's industry-leading advanced nuclear technology to the U.K. at scale. Together, we aim to build a fleet that has the ability to reliably deliver clean power, strengthen energy security, and grow the trans-Atlantic economy for decades to come. We believe Hartlepool is the right place to begin this journey, with an established industry and a base of professionals and services who can help drive the next generation of nuclear forward.""

In 2021 the U.K.’s Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) identified High-Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs) as the most promising advanced technology for demonstration. In 2025 X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear completed a number of year-long assessments, co-funded by DESNZ’s ‘Future Nuclear Enabling Fund’, to support the commercial deployment of Xe-100s in the U.K. Discussions are now underway with Government regarding the ""route to market"" in the UK, consistent with the principles set out in June for supporting privately led projects. The Government’s ongoing work to create a clear and credible pathway is instrumental in making the UK an attractive destination for investment in advanced modular reactors. Support for initial projects, and those that follow, will be decisive in unlocking the full potential of advanced nuclear for Britain’s energy future.

U.K. Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero Ed Miliband said:

""This cross-Atlantic partnership demonstrates the transformative potential for the British people of US and UK businesses joining forces, with X-Energy and Centrica’s planned first project alone having the potential to create up to 2,500 good, skilled jobs, add £12 billion in economic value and generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes. By working with the US, we will reap the benefits of this golden age of nuclear, powering British homes with clean, homegrown energy, delivering well-paid skilled jobs and getting energy bills down for good.""

United States Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said:

""With President Trump’s leadership, the United States is ushering in a true nuclear renaissance – harnessing the power of commercial nuclear to meet rising energy demand and fuel the AI revolution. Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators. Today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.""

Simone Rossi, CEO of EDF in the UK, said:

""As part of its role to enable further new nuclear development in the UK, EDF welcomes the interest by Centrica and X-Energy in Hartlepool as the first site to develop this technology, and we will support the development plans as they evolve.""

""It's really important that remote communities get a say in where their power comes from,"" Mr Schoenemann adds.
In Djarindjin, his company Amboranj Power is building a solar and battery power station, which will be locally- and publicly-owned.
For her, making sure remote residents have access to reliable, renewable power is about energy justice and equity.
""We've got technology that could really help lower people's energy costs,"" she notes.","Dark, rolling skies always trigger memories of disaster for Kathleen Walker.

She was one of 300 residents evacuated by helicopter from Wujal Wujal, in Queensland's far north, as Tropical Cyclone Jasper crossed the coast unleashing unprecedented floods in December 2023.

""When I see black clouds, I still have a trauma,"" she tells AAP.

Her community was left without power and unable to return to their homes for months.

Being away from home took a toll on the tight-knit group of residents yet it was also the eventual catalyst in fulfilling their decades-long dream of launching Wujal Wujal's own solar microgrid and battery system.

The project was an idea that had come from her husband and uncle some 20 years earlier, Ms Walker says.

They had both wanted to bring renewable energy to the small community as it had long struggled through power outages and other reliability issues.

Ms Walker says the microgrid will alleviate some of the still existing anxiety about being left without power.

""I am so proud and I am so glad that I get to see this thing go ahead,"" she says.

Richard Schoenemann has been working with Wujal Wujal since 2019 to make its dream a reality.

His company, Volt Advisory, needed to consult closely with the local Jabalbina Corporation and Elders to develop the project, he says, because they knew what they needed.

""It's really important that remote communities get a say in where their power comes from,"" Mr Schoenemann adds.

""It will actually work out better in the long run.""

Community is also at the heart of what Bard man Patrick Greechan is doing in Western Australia's Kimberley region.

In Djarindjin, his company Amboranj Power is building a solar and battery power station, which will be locally- and publicly-owned.

Aalga Goorlil, known as the sun turtle project, aims to lower costs, emissions and dependence on non-renewable energy.

""Renewables are a great vehicle to create financial security so that these communities can then pick which way the benefits go,"" Mr Greechan says.

""They can give themselves cheaper power, they can pay themselves in dividends, they can use the income to create other projects for the community, purchase other assets.""

He is also working on a solar and battery system for health clinic in Warburton, a remote Indigenous community on the Great Central Road, just south of the Gibson Desert.

It suffered 13 power outages in 2024 alone, impacting dialysis machines and emergency room facilities.

As Australia finds itself in a renewable energy boom, Mr Greechan reckons it's important isolated communities are empowered to decide what is best for them.

That's why he launched Amboranj, to make sure the people of the Kimberley aren't left behind and do have a voice in the projects developed on their Country.

""Any entities wishing to go into this space, need to understand that this is the opportunity to create economic prosperity,"" he says.

""If they could look at that versus their bottom line it saves the government, saves the taxpayer and creates so much ownership and pride within the community.""

Jaru and Gidja woman Ruby Heard, says as companies start to develop renewables in remote Australia, it's also important to make sure residents are educated about what might be best for them.

""There's predatory installers that go out to remote places, Indigenous communities and they are trying to sell second-rate technologies at high prices into to our households,"" she warns.

""It's, it's preying on people and they're not always aware that the technology is not leading technology and that the costs are too high.""

Ms Heard started Alinga Energy Consulting after volunteering for engineers without borders, building microgrids in communities Ethiopia without access to reliable energy.

She realised many remote communities in Australia could also benefit and were often being excluded from innovations like rooftop solar due to cost and distance.

For her, making sure remote residents have access to reliable, renewable power is about energy justice and equity.

""We've got technology that could really help lower people's energy costs,"" she notes.

""What we're finding is these benefits are being really unequally distributed because it's very cost-driven and for people living in remote areas, the costs are higher to get them connected.""

The bottom line for First Nations Clean Energy Network co-chair Karrina Nolan, is everyone deserves access to power and every community should have homes that are climate resilient.

Remote settlements across the country are making strides in renewables; getting involved in solar, wind, battery and hydro power projects while advocating for policy changes and funding to ensure the best possible outcomes for First Nations people.

While welcoming the federal government's commitments to implementing the First Nations Clean Energy Strategy, Ms Nolan says there's more work to be done to get the transition right.

""Some of our communities are living in extremely vulnerable conditions,"" she says.

""This is an opportunity to retrofit these households, upgrade them, get energy efficient appliances into them, put solar on the roof or next door in a microgrid.

""That makes them climate resilient, cheaper, more livable and cuts a whole heap of social and health costs.""",https://cdn.nit.com.au/storage/6YkcdWTmTb7gBBJLU0RVt36PCLU1I80p3ISJvD01.jpg?size=featured,N,,2025-09-14 18:59:57.965457

The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies.
This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.
The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.
""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement.","The Trump administration has unveiled a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, a move aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in airspace technology.

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.""

The FAA said it is accepting proposals and a minimum of five participants will be selected, according to an unpublished federal notice about the program that is set to become public on Tuesday.

The findings showed the tax cut was making electric cars accessible to a wider group of people, National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association chief executive Rohan Martin said, including workers who would not have otherwise been able to switch from a petrol or diesel car.
“The electric car discount is popular with families on middle incomes who live in the outer suburbs,” he said.
The federal tax cut and state-based registration discounts should be replaced, the commission said, by greater support for car-charging infrastructure.","The modelling comes after the Productivity Commission called on the federal government to scrap the tax break, calling it a duplicative and expensive policy.

It also follows national debate over the introduction of a road-user tax to be levied on electric vehicle drivers, and after several states, including NSW, Victoria and Queensland, removed rebates for their purchase.

The research, prepared by Magenta Advisory, investigated the fringe-benefits tax exemption introduced in July 2022 that cut the price of electric cars purchased through novated leases.

It found the tax cut could help to put an additional 1.5 million electric cars on Australian roads if extended until 2035, and had already aided in the purchase of 105,000 more EVs between 2022 and 2024.

An additional 200,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles could hit the roads in Australia by 2035 if they were allowed back into the scheme, the modelling found, and could contribute to a growing second-hand market by adding 870,000 low-emission cars.

Allowing the scheme to run until 2035 would also cut transport emissions by 50 per cent more than if the tax exemption was removed in 2027 when it is due to be reviewed, the report said.

Failing to take action to cut transport emissions in this way could see Australia miss its 2050 net-zero target, Electric Vehicle Council chief executive Julie Delvecchio said.

“With transport on track to be Australia’s largest emitting sector, incentives like the EV discount are critical to hitting our climate goals,” she said.

“Keeping this support until 2035 and bringing back plug-in hybrids into the scheme could deliver hundreds of thousands more new and second-hand EVs, making them affordable for more households.”

Electric car purchases under the scheme had been most popular in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane suburbs between 30km and 44km outside city centres, the analysis found, and to drivers on incomes between $90,000 and $120,000.

“The electric car discount is popular with families on middle incomes who live in the outer suburbs,” he said.

The findings come despite a proposal from a Productivity Commission report to scrap the tax break, which it said had cost taxpayers between $1000 and $20,000 per tonne of carbon emissions abated.

With EV adoption on the rise and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, insurers and policyholders alike are navigating uncharted territory.","Auto insurance in Michigan—and across the nation—has always been a hot topic, but recent events and new data are pushing it right back into the spotlight. On September 12, 2025, CURE Auto Insurance, a New Jersey-based insurer, agreed to pay a Troy, Michigan man $75,000 for a claim on his wrecked 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This payout came only after the company initially denied the claim, canceled his policy, auctioned off the SUV, and kept the proceeds, according to reporting by The Detroit News.

But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The same day, Anita Fox, director of the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services, issued a strongly worded bulletin warning insurers against what she called ""improper"" and ""abusive practices."" While Fox's bulletin didn't name specific companies, the timing and details echoed the very practices CURE Auto Insurance is accused of in the Troy man's case and in other lawsuits. Fox's message was clear: ""Insurers must not engage in practices that harm or disadvantage consumers when handling claims.""

Fox's bulletin outlined a laundry list of unacceptable behaviors, including denying valid claims, canceling policies without adequate justification, and profiting from the sale of claimants' vehicles after denial. These practices, she noted, violate not just the letter but the spirit of Michigan's insurance regulations, which are designed to protect policyholders from unfair treatment. ""We are committed to holding insurers accountable when they fail to treat Michigan consumers fairly,"" Fox stated.

The CURE case has become a flashpoint for broader concerns. The company is currently being sued for similar alleged improper practices in other claims, and the spotlight from state regulators is only growing brighter. For many Michigan drivers, especially those who rely on their vehicles for daily life, these revelations are deeply unsettling. After all, when you pay your premiums faithfully, you expect your insurer to have your back in a crisis—not to pull the rug out from under you.

But the story doesn't end with individual disputes. Michigan's insurance market is facing another, perhaps even more dramatic, shift—one that's affecting drivers far beyond the state's borders. According to a recent report from Insurify, as highlighted by GOBankingRates on September 14, 2025, premiums for electric vehicle (EV) drivers have soared by 16 percent in the last year alone. On average, EV owners are now paying $4,058 annually for coverage—about 49 percent more than their gas-powered counterparts, who pay roughly $2,732 per year.

Why the dramatic difference? Insurify points to the higher costs associated with repairing and replacing EVs. These vehicles, while often touted as the future of transportation, come with expensive parts and specialized labor requirements. That means when accidents happen, insurers are on the hook for bigger payouts—and those costs are being passed along to consumers in the form of higher premiums.

Not every EV is created equal when it comes to insurance costs, though. Insurify's data reveals that several popular models stand out for their particularly steep premiums. The Tesla Model X, for example, is the priciest to insure, with an annual cost of $4,765. Its gas-powered counterpart, the Audi Q3, costs $2,889 to insure—a difference of nearly 65 percent. The Model X's luxury status and advanced features, like its iconic falcon-wing doors, certainly play a role in driving up those numbers.

Even the more affordable Tesla Model 3, which starts at $44,130 according to Kelley Blue Book, carries a hefty insurance bill: $4,546 per year. That's 21 percent more than its gas-powered alternative, the Mercedes-Benz A-Class, which costs $3,592 to insure. And while the Model Y is less expensive to insure than the Model X or S, its insurance cost of $4,189 is still about 44 percent higher than the Audi Q5's $2,915. Interestingly, the Model Y also has a claims frequency of 29.47 percent, compared to just 5.22 percent for the Model S, according to data cited by Insurify from auto insights company Mitchell. That's a staggering difference and a key factor in the higher premiums.

It's not just Tesla drivers feeling the pinch. The Cadillac Lyriq, another luxury EV, costs $3,752 per year to insure compared to $2,671 for its gas-powered sibling, the Cadillac XT5—a 29 percent jump. The Hyundai Ioniq 5, which has won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy Award in the EV class for two years running, isn't immune either. Its insurance cost is $3,503, about 34 percent more than the Hyundai Kona, its gas-powered alternative, at $2,621.

The reasons for these disparities are complex. As Insurify explained, ""Premiums reflect the risk and expense of paying out claims."" With EVs, the risk profile is different: batteries are costly to replace, repairs require specialized technicians, and even minor accidents can lead to expensive fixes. For insurers, that means higher potential losses—and for drivers, it means higher bills.

For many consumers, these rising costs are forcing tough choices. Some may reconsider the financial wisdom of going electric, despite the environmental benefits and potential long-term savings on fuel and maintenance. Others might be tempted to cut back on coverage or shop aggressively for better rates, hoping to find an insurer willing to take a chance on their EV at a more reasonable price.

Meanwhile, Michigan regulators are under pressure to ensure that all drivers—whether they're behind the wheel of a gas-guzzler or a cutting-edge EV—are treated fairly. Fox's bulletin, while not naming specific companies, sends a strong message to the industry: ""We will not tolerate practices that disadvantage Michigan consumers."" For insurers, it's a warning shot across the bow. For consumers, it's a glimmer of hope that someone is watching out for their interests.

As the auto insurance landscape continues to evolve, one thing is certain: the stakes are higher than ever. With EV adoption on the rise and regulatory scrutiny intensifying, insurers and policyholders alike are navigating uncharted territory. The coming months will reveal whether companies like CURE—and the industry as a whole—can adapt to these new realities while keeping trust with the drivers who depend on them.

For now, Michigan drivers—and EV owners nationwide—are left to weigh their options carefully, hoping that the next time they need their insurance, their insurer will be there for them, not just in the fine print, but in practice.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 21:59:58.527091

The US (about 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action.","The scale of the Albanese government’s climate action ambition for the next decade will be set this week with the anticipated release of its 2035 emissions reduction target.

The target is one of several expected announcements revealing the “scary” risks posed by the climate crisis, what the government intends to do, and how.

Climate risks

The first announcement, expected on Monday, will be the release of the national climate risk assessment, a long-promised analysis of the economic and environmental risks posed by the climate crisis.

People familiar with it have said it is “intense and scary”, and confronting even for those who work in the area. It will be accompanied by a national climate adaptation plan, a high-level framework for managing a changing climate.

Developed by the Australian Climate Service and the climate change department, work on the risk assessment has included highly detailed modelling of future damage, estimates of the number of people who could be killed by worsening heatwaves and development of a mapping tool that forecasts flooding risk in suburbs across the continent.

Sources say that under some scenarios, even major systems – such as electricity networks, transport routes, food production and the financial sector – could struggle to cope.

Cutting emissions

The biggest announcement will be the government’s 2035 emissions reduction target, expected on Thursday or Friday after cabinet signoff.

Like the risk assessment, this has been significantly delayed. It was initially promised by February but postponed until after the May election as the government waited on advice from the Climate Change Authority, a government agency chaired by former NSW Liberal treasurer Matt Kean.

The government is expected to announce the target at the same time it releases a barrage of reports, including the Climate Change Authority’s target advice, a plan to reach net zero by 2050 and an analysis of what can be done to cut pollution in six sectors of the economy, including electricity and energy, transport, industry, agriculture and land, resources and the built environment.

New policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be unveiled alongside the new goal, which would build on the government’s 2030 target of a 43% reduction on 2005 levels.

The latest annual emissions projections, published in November, suggest the government is on track to hit 42.6% – just shy of the legislated target.

Setting targets

The 2035 target matters not just in Australia, but internationally. It will be submitted to the UN as part of the country’s “nationally determined contribution” – what the government says it can do to help the world meet goals in the 2015 Paris agreement. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has indicated Australia is likely to submit a range rather than a single number.

The Paris deal includes a commitment that the target must be more ambitious than the existing 2030 goal – there can be no backsliding – and reflect the country’s “highest possible ambition”. The Climate Change Authority released a consultation paper in April 2024 with its preliminary assessment, finding a cut of at least 65% and up to 75% “would be ambitious and could be achievable if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households”.

Since then, the authority has been consulting with experts and interest groups and has undertaken modelling to refine its advice. It is understood its board – including scientists and business figures – reached its final position last week, and the report is yet to go to government.

The authority is required to consider what the best scientific advice says Australia should be doing to keep alive the goal of trying to limit global heating to 1.5C since preindustrial times. It should also consider the international political and diplomatic landscape, the economics of what’s possible, the pace of technological development and what is considered socially deliverable.

From a scientific view, analyses have found Australia should make a percentage cut of somewhere between the high 70s to 100% – actually reaching net zero – by 2035. Australia’s Pacific island neighbours have also stressed the need for their more developed friend to be as ambitious as possible – and to stop approving new fossil fuel developments.

Some of these analyses – including by the thinktank Climate Analytics and the Australian Conservation Foundation – have detailed estimates of how cuts could be made to meet a target of at least 75%. Climate campaigners generally believe the target range must include 75% to be credible.

But other experts, such as Frank Jotzo, the director of the Australian National University’s Centre for Climate and Energy Policy, have argued that even a target of 65% would be ambitious, given it would require pollution to be effectively cut in half over the next decade. He argues that new policies behind the target are ultimately more important than the number.

Business organisations are politically influential and vary markedly in their positions. One group of about 500 that includes Fortescue, Atlassian, Ikea and Unilever has argued strongly for 75%. Others have emphasised the cost of action and pitched for a goal in the 50s.

The Business Council of Australia issued a veiled warning about setting a target in the 60s or 70s, publishing modelling suggesting between $395bn and $530bn of capital investment would be needed.

International action

The picture across developed countries is mixed. The US (about 10% of global emissions) has abandoned the field on climate action. The UK has a 2035 goal equivalent to a 78% cut below 2005 levels, and the EU is expected to land in the 70s. But Canada and New Zealand have set much lower goals (45-50% and 51-55% respectively).

As an emerging economy, China – the world’s biggest national polluter – has not yet set targets on the scale of those nations that developed earlier. Its current goal is that its pollution will peak by 2030.

Some analyses suggest that may have already happened as it builds extraordinary amounts of renewable energy and uses less coal power (even as it continues to build new plants). There is a lot of focus ahead of the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November on what Beijing will promise to do by 2035.

In an interview last week, Bowen pointed to a 2021 calculation by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that suggested global emissions needed to be cut by 60% between 2019 and 2035 to keep the 1.5C goal on the table. That translates to a 68% cut below 2005 levels – the baseline used by Australia.

But global heating has accelerated since then and 68% is a planet-wide average. Developed countries such as Australia would have to do more.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98031c4650d3ed0623532c713bcc53a1dac6015f/0_0_3207_2567/master/3207.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=77c404808207b883212dad60f549971d",N,,2025-09-14 16:59:08.568476

• Ensuring that governance of the new market respects state procurement, environmental, reliability, and other public policies.
• Protecting California’s ability to withdraw from the regional market at any time.","California state lawmakers on Sept. 13 approved a legislative package that includes the creation of an expanded Wildfire Fund and enabling the Pathways Initiative for a voluntary, west-wide regional electricity market.

The legislation was announced by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Senate President pro Tempore Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas on Sept. 10.

AB 825, authored by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, Senator Josh Becker, and Speaker Robert Rivas, “preserves California’s control over critical policy functions — including transmission planning and procurement — while unlocking the benefits of broader regional cooperation: greater grid reliability, reduced blackout risk, more affordable clean power, and lower emissions,” a news release from Becker’s office said.

Recent amendments to AB 825 “include rigorous annual legislative oversight by relevant California legislative policy committees to ensure the new market operates in line with California’s clean energy and reliability goals. The bill also provides strong protections for state authority, including California’s right to withdraw at any time if participation ceases to benefit the state,” the news release said.

“By enabling least-cost dispatch across a broader pool of Western resources, the Pathways Initiative is expected to save California ratepayers up to $10 billion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Brattle Group,” Becker’s office said. “California will also reduce the costs of maintaining a state-specific strategic reliability reserve by pooling resources with other participating areas.”

The California ISO said that the “bill establishes a clear path toward independent governance for the West's interconnected electric grid. This milestone was shaped by years of successful regional collaboration and the proven success of our Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), which has delivered more than $7.41 billion in cumulative savings since launch in 2014,” it said.

As the Pathways Committee develops the framework for the new regional organization, “we will coordinate closely to ensure alignment with legislative requirements. We remain fully committed to the successful launch of our Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) in 2026 and will offer technical support throughout this important transition,” the grid operator said.

Becker’s office said that key safeguards in AB 825 include:

• Maintaining California ISO’s role in planning for and operating California’s grid.

• Ensuring that governance of the new market respects state procurement, environmental, reliability, and other public policies.

• Providing the CPUC and other stakeholders with access to critical market data.

• Protecting California’s ability to withdraw from the regional market at any time.

Wildfire Funds (SB 254)

SB 254 (Becker/Petrie-Norris) ""enables more affordable electric grid investments by improving utility wildfire oversight, creating an expanded Wildfire Fund and enhancing oversight of utility business practices,"" Becker's office said.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/7e5595a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7547x4245+0+448/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F32%2F32%2Fad74d8e809b04ee8d202675b6393%2F2183a975fede4e5bbfd309f8aa660def,N,,2025-09-14 16:59:13.121616

Under the proposed rules, amendments passed in House Bill 457 (2025 Regular Session) would strengthen the state’s legal authority to regulate permitting, monitoring, corrective action, and public engagement. Public comments are being accepted through September 26, 2025 (details here), and a stakeholder workshop is scheduled for October 9.

New Mexico on track to join Class VI well club

If approved, New Mexico will join a small but growing group of states that already hold primacy for Class VI wells used for carbon storage. States with full authority at this point include North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, and West Virginia.

Arizona has also just been granted Class VI primacy by the EPA. Other states—including Texas, Colorado, Utah, Alabama, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Alaska—are in various earlier stages of rulemaking or pre-application activity.

New Mexico’s efforts reflect both growing urgency and complexity in the regulation of carbon capture and storage: ensuring that state rules are at least as protective as federal regulations, managing public participation, and setting up monitoring and enforcement regimes.

Utilities have reported a 45% reduction in outages by using LiDAR and AI modeling for vegetation management.","Vegetation is a much-needed part of the natural world and is essential for life to thrive on Earth. Yet, when unmanaged, it’s also one of the greatest threats to the grid and a leading culprit for causing outages. Fallen branches topple powerlines, roots damage underground cables, and overgrown trees close to energized wires are known to ignite catastrophic wildfires.

The consequences are enormous. Power outages hit Americans with a $150-billion bill every year, based on Department of Energy numbers, and vegetation issues are behind a lot of those costs.

Just two years ago, a devastating wildfire hit Maui, killing 102 people and destroying 2,200 structures. Sparks from damaged utility lines re-energized unexpectedly, setting nearby vegetation on fire. This is a devastating reminder of the difficult balance utilities must strike between keeping the lights on and protecting public safety.

Historically, utilities have used routine trimming and in-person inspections to manage vegetation. But with labor shortages, rising costs, and wildfire risk increasing, they now need to evolve into risk-based vegetation management.

AI alongside drones and LiDAR (light detection and ranging), provide visibility, predictive modeling, and automation. This empowers utilities to reduce risks, cut costs, and maintain compliance, all while mitigating outages and keeping the power on.

The Vegetation Challenge

Vegetation may seem like a simple problem to solve, but in practice it’s one of the most persistent threats to reliable power delivery. Fast-growing species grow towards overhead conductors, and storms, heavy winds and ice cause branches to snap, igniting wildfires, taking down power lines and triggering widespread outages. And the industry has been grappling with this issue for decades. With extreme weather causing more frequent wildfires, the industry must adopt AI to protect the grid and serve its ratepayers.

Yet traditional approaches are not working. Ground crews may spend weeks patrolling remote corridors on foot or by truck, only to cover a fraction of the system. Helicopter inspections expand coverage areas but bring considerable safety concerns and hefty price tags. And more than half of utilities admit their vegetation management funding doesn’t match operational requirements.

The situation, therefore, becomes even more problematic. Vegetation threats are growing while the money to address them keeps shrinking. AI presents an opportunity to bridge this gap.

How LiDAR and AI Can Drive Smarter, Safer Vegetation Strategies

Utilities have long needed to supplement manual inspection with technology like satellite imagery, aerial surveys, and, more recently, drones. Yet the real breakthrough comes when high-resolution LiDAR data is combined with AI, transforming raw images into actionable business insights.

Clarity of Data Collection: LiDAR technology allows utilities to survey vast areas and infrastructure in weeks by creating detailed 3D point clouds capturing vegetation density, tree height, and encroachment risks with centimeter-level accuracy. Manual patrols simply can’t match this. And the data stays objective and repeatable and avoids human error or fatigue. This removes significant pressure from manpower constraints, eliminating the need for crews to spend days on manual inspections.

AI Modeling of Data: AI and ML algorithms review and analyze LiDAR data to detect vegetation encroachment, tree health issues, and potential hazards in high-risk areas. Rotting trees create serious risks for power lines during intense storms and high winds, for instance. Utilities can use LiDAR-based modeling to identify problematic trees, then quickly dispatch teams to safely remove them—this reduces future outage risks.

Via a combination of data from past vegetation growth, weather, and up-to-date field insights, LiDAR and AI-driven modeling, can predict future issues. For example, the AI system flags areas where fast-growing trees will likely extend onto transmission and/or distribution lines, causing outages in future storms. This gives utilities sufficient data and time for proactive tree trimming crew scheduling rather than waiting for outages or fire risks during storms or natural vegetation growth.

Fixed Cycle to Risk-Based Scheduling

Traditionally, utilities trim vegetation on fixed cycles. For instance, trim trees every three or five years, regardless of actual risk. Instead of trimming every mile of line on a fixed schedule, utilities can use AI risk models to target the most vulnerable corridors. With crews attending to the most risk-prone areas first, this supports risk-based scheduling. This targeted approach reduces outage risk, lowers wildfire exposure, and improves compliance with regulatory clearance standards. And as importantly, this approach saves money: avoiding routine trimming where it isn’t needed and reallocating funds to high-risk zones.

Centralizing Data: On top of its exceptional modeling capabilities, when utilities leverage an AI platform, it provides a centralized location for all data. When teams continuously gather information from the field like photos and sensor readings, they can be documented and stored in a centralized system, creating a single source of truth for decision-making, accessible to all. Combining field data collected on a continuous basis with LiDAR data gathered on an annual basis provides a powerful dataset for modeling.

This “single source of truth” creates a living digital twin of the network and enhances audit readiness, regulatory reporting, and cross-department collaboration. Instead of sifting through fragmented spreadsheets and inspection notes, decision-makers see a unified risk picture across the grid.

Implementation Considerations: AI may sound like the magic bullet for utilities in their efforts to get vegetation management under control, but it takes some thoughtful planning to implement AI safely and successfully.

AI Integration: One of the first hurdles utilities face when adopting LiDAR and AI is making it work with their existing utility management systems. Most utilities have a patchwork of tools, including outage management systems, GIS mapping, SCADA monitoring, and asset management platforms that don’t ‘talk’ to each other.

Integrating AI so its recommendations flow directly into existing workflows is a must. AI should be able to automatically create a maintenance ticket, update the asset database, and alert the right teams for follow-up actions when it spots a risky stretch of power lines. All of this must be completed without manual data entry, along with the ability for human intervention.

The way to make this happen is by building a robust data pipeline:

Bringing in data from LiDAR, drones, satellites, and field crews.

Cleaning and standardizing that data so it’s usable.

Storing the data in an organized and consistent way.

Running AI models to turn raw data into prioritized, actionable insights.

When done right, integration allows AI to become part of the utility’s daily operations, helping crews respond faster and budgets stretch further.

Staff Training and Operational Changes

Even the best AI system won’t make an impact if people don’t know how to use it. Vegetation management crews, dispatchers, and planners need training not just on the software but on how to interpret and trust AI-driven recommendations.

For success, utilities need to appoint change management leaders to organize the training and control the AI rollout. Hands-on training for AI literacy, clear communication about “why” the shift is happening, and a phased adoption so staff don’t feel overwhelmed will all assist in an easier transition. In practice, this looks like an AI pilot program used to prioritize inspections in one region, allowing teams to feel confident and comfortable before scaling company-wide.

Utilities have to stretch tightened budgets to maintain the millions of miles that make up utilities infrastructure across the U.S., but leaning on manual inspection is not feasible or efficient. Integrating LiDAR and AI solutions smartly and safely can help utilities reduce risks, improve compliance, and shift from reactive to proactive vegetation management.

Regulatory and Security Considerations

Utilities face compliance obligations under North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) standards. AI tools can strengthen audit readiness by providing timestamped, geolocated evidence of vegetation clearances.

At the same time, centralizing sensitive data introduces cybersecurity risks. Utilities must ensure robust protections for cloud storage, mobile field devices, and AI platforms.

Financial Justification: Convincing utility executives to invest in AI requires more than technical promise. It requires financial justification. Fortunately, there’s compelling potential for the return on investment.

UReduced inspection costs: LiDAR and AI analysis can cover in weeks what might take boots-on-the-ground crews months and years.

Lower outage costs: Preventing even a single wildfire or large-scale outage can save hundreds of millions, even billions in potential liabilities and fines. Utilities have reported a 45% reduction in outages by using LiDAR and AI modeling for vegetation management.

Improved compliance: Automated reporting reduces manual effort and audit penalties.

Optimized trimming cycles: Targeted risk-based scheduling saves money by trimming only where needed.

Early adopters have seen inspection cost reductions of 30 to 50%, in addition to saving millions annually in avoided emergency response. As AI models mature and data volumes grow, these savings are likely to accelerate.

Unmanaged vegetation is a persistent and costly challenge for utilities. AI and LiDAR can help utilities shift to a proactive approach to managing vegetation. With a technology-forward approach utilities can manage risk, stretch budgets farther, improve compliance and reliability, and enhance resilience.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vegetation-management-wildfire.png,N,,2025-09-14 14:58:43.043596

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.everythinglubbock.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2025/09/68c5fc4a93f3e4.61868730.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 12:03:37.003165

Brett Christophers has put his finger on an uncomfortable truth. Renewable energy has reached the point where it is often cheaper to generate than fossil fuels, yet the rate of investment is still far below what climate targets demand. His book, The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet, explains why.

Investors follow profit, not need, and renewables are structured in a way that turns falling costs into falling revenues. Solar panels and wind turbines produce power at near zero marginal cost, so competition drives prices down. That is good for consumers and good for emissions, but it makes for wafer-thin profit margins that are not attractive to capital looking for steady, high returns. Fossil fuels by contrast remain in many cases more profitable because their scarcity can be controlled and their markets are designed to reward incumbents. Christophers’ conclusion is stark. If profitability is the bottleneck, then leaving the transition to private capital will not work at the speed required. The state must take on a far larger role.

The core of his argument is hard to dispute. If companies and financiers do not see an acceptable return, they will not deploy capital. He documents how even record low bids for renewable projects have been followed by cancellations or pleas for more support when inflation or supply chain pressures squeeze margins. He reminds readers that what has been built so far has leaned heavily on subsidies, tax credits, or guaranteed contracts, not on free market enthusiasm. Without that scaffolding, private developers walk away. It is a useful correction to the triumphalist narrative that renewables will sweep the board simply because they are cheaper on paper.

Christophers’ prescription for action is that governments must move beyond reliance on markets and take a leading role by building and owning renewable infrastructure themselves, or through public utilities and agencies. Where private developers are involved, he insists that the state must guarantee returns through long-term contracts, subsidies, or price supports that stabilize revenues.

He frames electricity as a public good ill-suited to volatile spot markets and better managed through planned, coordinated investment in generation, grids, and storage. In short, he calls for a decisive expansion of state leadership and ownership, with private capital relegated to a supporting role under strict public frameworks, on the grounds that only by bending or bypassing the logic of profit can the transition proceed at the pace the climate crisis demands. Basically, he calls for socializing electrical generation and removing markets from the equation.

However, credible critics have pointed out that the story is not quite that simple. Renewable profitability varies by technology, geography, and market design. A rooftop solar installation in Germany is a different investment proposition than offshore wind in the North Sea or utility-scale solar in Texas. Many economists note that market design can be reshaped to stabilize revenues. Contracts for difference, long-term power purchase agreements, and capacity payments already exist in many jurisdictions and have drawn in billions of dollars of private capital. Others stress that non-financial bottlenecks such as lengthy permitting, overloaded interconnection queues, and grid congestion slow the pace of deployment even when investment appetite is strong. Christophers is right to highlight profit as a barrier, but it is not the only brake on progress.

There are also fair cautions about his solution. Public ownership can deliver long-term capacity, but state-run utilities have mixed track records, and governments face their own constraints, from budget limits to political interference.

The real question is not whether capitalism must be abandoned but how far it must be bent to public purpose. History offers a guide. Almost every major infrastructure build in the past century combined public rule-setting with private execution. Railroads, highways, telecommunications networks, and electricity grids were all made possible by government interventions that made them investable. The clean energy transition will be no different. The challenge is to design frameworks that unlock capital while ensuring deployment at the necessary pace.

One tool is market design that ensures adequate returns. Electricity markets that rely on energy-only spot prices expose renewable projects to extreme volatility. When the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, prices collapse, sometimes to zero or even negative, and investors cannot rely on a steady cash flow. That makes banks reluctant to lend without charging a high premium. Instruments like contracts for difference in the UK solve this by guaranteeing a fixed price for generation over 15 to 20 years. Developers bid competitively, which keeps costs down for consumers, but they know exactly what revenue they will earn, which makes projects financeable.

Long-term corporate power purchase agreements play a similar role, although Christophers notes that large buyers often negotiate very low rates that squeeze developers. Capacity markets and ancillary service payments can also provide steady income for being available to the grid, not just for producing power in a given hour. These tools stabilize cash flows and lower the cost of capital, which is critical for capital intensive technologies like wind and solar.

Another tool is public support for finance. Governments can use green banks, loan guarantees, or co-investment funds to take on part of the risk that deters private lenders. A green bank providing low interest loans, or a public entity taking the first loss in a project portfolio, can make the difference between a renewable project being bankable or shelved. The Inflation Reduction Act in the United States was an example of public money creating private profitability. Generous tax credits and direct payments made clean energy projects attractive to investors, and as a result the pipeline of solar, wind, and battery plants expanded dramatically. This is capitalism with a thumb on the scale, and it shows that policy can shift capital quickly when it aligns profits with climate goals.

There is also a role for direct public investment in infrastructure the market will not build on time. Transmission lines, interconnectors, and large-scale storage are expensive, slow to permit, and often unprofitable for private firms to build on their own. Yet without them, renewable projects remain stranded. Governments can and should take the lead on these backbone elements, whether by funding them outright or by creating regulated monopoly frameworks that guarantee returns. The payoff is that private developers can then connect new projects without prohibitive delays. Public ownership is justified in these cases because the social value of expanded grids and storage far exceeds the private return.

Carbon pricing and clean energy standards are additional levers. By making fossil fuels more expensive or mandating a rising share of renewables in electricity supply, governments tilt the economics decisively. A robust carbon price or an enforceable renewable portfolio standard creates predictable demand for clean power. That demand, in turn, gives investors confidence that their projects will have a market. These policies are not without political difficulty, but they are well within the toolkit of capitalist economies.

Reducing soft costs is another area where policy can raise effective returns without raising consumer bills. Every month cut from permitting timelines or interconnection delays improves the net present value of a project. Standardized contracts, transparent grid data, and faster regulatory processes all contribute to making renewables more attractive investments. This is not about subsidies or public ownership, but about making the system function more efficiently.

There are selective cases where public ownership makes sense. Grid infrastructure is one. Repowering old coal sites with renewables where transmission already exists is another. Early stage offshore wind zones or large storage projects may also benefit from public build-own-operate models, especially if private capital is hesitant. The key is to ensure such ventures are governed transparently, with clear mandates to deliver reliable, low-cost clean power, not to serve as political tools.

Evidence from around the world supports this blended approach. The UK’s offshore wind boom was driven by contracts for difference that de-risked investment. The United States is seeing a surge of projects thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits and loans. China’s massive build-out of wind and solar is guided by state planning and executed by both state-owned and private firms. Each case shows that when government sets the ground rules and shoulders part of the risk, private capital will scale clean energy. The common thread is that markets are not left on their own. They are bent to serve a public purpose.

As a note, this is one of a select group of books I’ve read which does an excellent job of assessing a complex space and clearly identifying issues, then veers off course into fairly bad prescriptions for action. Marx’ Communist Manifesto did an excellent job of identifying issues with capitalism, then offered a terrible alternative. Naomi Klein’s No Logo‘s first half was a master class in branding, and I learned a lot from it, but the second half was a laundry list of mostly meaningless resistance, not a useful alternative. The Price Is Wrong falls into this category, and for anyone seeing a trend here, you aren’t wrong. All three are worth reading for the diagnosis of the problems, but the strategic policies and plans are shaped by bias, aren’t relevant, and are clearly better resolved within the framework of market economies than through removing markets from the equation.

The conclusion is straightforward. Addressing Christophers’ challenges does not require abandoning capitalism. It requires writing rules that make clean, reliable power profitable to build and cheap to buy. Capitalism will not save the planet on autopilot, but it can be harnessed if governments are willing to set the terms. The measure of success is not ideology but delivered clean terawatt-hours at stable prices. The faster policymakers align markets with that outcome, the faster the transition will proceed.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-14-2025-07_40_26-AM-800x533.png,N,,2025-09-14 12:01:44.183049

Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?""","HARRISBURG, Pa. — With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said.

Questioning the affordability premise The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt.
“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said.
At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind.
His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fde5aad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1536x806+0+109/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2F46%2F485856f344ccafaa914580726190%2F090622-powerlines-lv-cm-002.JPEG,N,,2025-09-14 10:59:49.557277

Developed by VW subsidiary PowerCo, the prismatic cell will debut in the automaker's line of affordable EVs launching in 2026.

Over time, VW plans to use the cell across all its brands—from VW to Porsche—and adapt it to chemistries including LFP, sodium-ion and solid-state.

The Volkswagen Group's years-long effort to create a standardized battery cell to use across its electric portfolio is finally coming together. This week at IAA Munich, Europe's biggest auto expo, the automaker said it completed development of its ""unified cell"" and laid out a roadmap for the technology's future.

The idea behind the standardized cell is to unlock super-sized economies of scale around one of the most crucial EV components, VW executives explained at the show. That's critical, because almost no manufacturers besides Tesla have managed to turn a profit on their electric cars—largely because they've been crushed by high battery costs and limited production scale. Carmakers in Europe in particular need to meet escalating emissions rules and combat an influx of high-quality, highly subsidized Chinese offerings too.

Now, as Volkswagen prepares a renewed EV product offensive and advanced electrical architectures sourced from Rivian, it also has big plans for the batteries that are central to any EV.

""This brings us back to the driver's seat in one of the key technologies of our industry,"" said Thomas Schmall, member of the Volkswagen board of management responsible for technology, at IAA.

The prismatic cell developed by PowerCo, the automaker's battery subsidiary, will start series production within ""weeks"" at its factory in Salzgitter, Germany and ramp up next year, PowerCo CEO Frank Blome said during a presentation. Production will follow at plants in Spain and Canada in 2026 and 2027, respectively, he said.

The cell will power up to 80% of the VW Group's EV models from 2030 and extend to all brands, the company said. That means variations of it will be found in everything from Volkswagens and Škodas to Porsches and Audis. And they'll go into vehicles sold across the U.S., China and Europe. Notably, Porsche recently scrapped its own in-house battery manufacturing project.

""The basic idea for us is to standardize things wherever possible. We customize wherever necessary,"" said VW battery executive Guenther Mendl.

The unified cell will debut in the VW Group's ""Electric Urban Car Family,"" four models on the new MEB+ platform that VW says will start at around 25,000 euros, or roughly $29,000. Those include the Volkswagen ID. Polo and ID. Cross, along with the Cupra Raval hatchback.

VW says the unified cell will deliver a driving range of up to 450 kilometers (279 miles) in those cars. It says the cell demonstrates a volumetric energy density of 660 watt-hours per liter, a 10% improvement over VW's previous cells.

Ultimately, though, range and other specs will vary from vehicle to vehicle. VW says the cell can be adapted to different dimensions and can work in large and small vehicles. It can work with 400-volt and 800-volt architectures too.

VW's unified prismatic cells can be adapted to different sizes, executives said at IAA.

The unified cell will eventually employ several different battery chemistries, according to VW, starting with nickel manganese cobalt (NMC), which is the most popular format in the West. Soon, PowerCo will start manufacturing cheaper lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells too, which are taking off globally because of their low cost and durability over years of charging.

""Technologically speaking we're still at the very beginning,"" Blome said, through a translator. ""So we're going to first have NMC, then LFP, then sodium and solid-state is also in the pipeline. It's included in the development roadmap, and we're also talking about further architectures and cell chemistries that we've started to work on.""

VW will start producing LFP unified cells at a factory in Valencia, Spain, in 2027. Solid-state batteries are likely farther off, as no company has successfully commercialized this holy grail battery technology. However, at IAA, Volkswagen rolled out its first demonstration vehicle with solid-state battery tech, a Ducati motorcycle with cells from VW-backed QuantumScape.

Executives said they chose the prismatic form factor—a rectangular box rather than a cylinder or flexible pouch—so that it could accommodate different chemistries over time. The shape is key in another way, too. In a new design for the VW Group, the cells stack together and slot directly into a vehicle's battery pack, rather than being packaged into a handful of modules first.

This cell-to-pack technology eliminates parts and frees up more space for batteries inside a vehicle, boosting range while cutting weight and cost, Mendl said, also calling the design ""extremely important.""

VW isn't alone here. The cheaper-to-build, overhauled EV platform that Ford announced in August uses prismatic cells integrated directly into a pack as well. The Rivian R2 eliminates the modules found in its R1 series. General Motors bet big on a scalable battery platform called Ultium, based on battery packs with different configurations of standardized modules. Now it's also looking into prismatic cells that can eliminate battery substructures and reduce the number of modules.

Volkswagen won't take on the brunt of manufacturing all on its own. The company said it plans to offload about 50% of cell production to suppliers, which, according to a presentation attended by InsideEVs Germany, include Gotion, CATL, Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution.

The cells aren't just for cars, either. They will also go into stationary battery banks built by Elli, VW's new energy storage company.

Frequently Asked Questions: Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked Do electric vehicles pollute more than gas cars due to battery production?","Rumors, clickbait, and lively dinner table debates—when it comes to electric vehicles, misinformation travels faster than a Lucid Air on a straightaway. In 2025, with Tesla sedans quietly weaving through traffic and BYD, Ford, Nissan, Chevrolet, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Polestar, Lucid Motors, and Rivian all fighting for market share, electric cars have leapt from niche status to global presence. Still, persistent myths muddy the facts for curious new drivers and skeptics alike. Are EVs really worse for the environment? Are battery fires about to erupt? Is public charging still a mythological quest? Below, we untangle the biggest misconceptions, diving into real-world stories, data, and a few surprises about the cars shaping our roads, jobs, and future.

Electric Vehicle Environmental Impact: Separating Myth from Reality

As Jane, a journalist from Manchester, prepared to trade her aging Ford Focus for a gleaming new EV, she heard it all: “It’ll take you 77,000 miles just to break even on emissions.” Yet recent data tells a different story. A Tesla Model Y in the UK balances out its initial ‘carbon debt’ after just 13,000 miles—less than two years for most drivers. Over a full life, its emissions are about three times lower than an average petrol car. Production emissions, especially from batteries, do exist; however, as Europe’s and the world’s electric grids get cleaner, the benefits keep improving. Meanwhile, manufacturers like Volkswagen and Hyundai are pushing for greener supply chains, driving these numbers down further. The story is clear: whether you drive a Nissan Leaf, Chevrolet Bolt, or Polestar 2, the green advantage begins early and grows over time.

Electric Grid and Charging Infrastructure: Can the System Cope?

Skeptics like to recall headlines forecasting grid collapse or a shortage of public chargers. Yet, since the UK hit 50,000 public charging points, and with global investments topping $1 trillion for future infrastructure, the landscape is shifting rapidly. Technologies like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) now allow EVs to stabilize the grid rather than overwhelm it. In fact, modern grids—even in coal-heavy countries—are handling the transition smoothly, aided by smarter home charging and overnight rates. Jane, now a proud Hyundai Ioniq 5 owner, charges at home most nights, waking to a full battery. And with networks from Tesla Superchargers to ChargePoint expanding fast, ‘range anxiety’ is giving way to newfound convenience.

Myths Around Cost, Maintenance, and Battery Life in Electric Cars

For many like Alex, a London rideshare driver recently switching from a diesel VW Golf to a BYD Atto 3, the biggest shock wasn’t the silence or acceleration—it was realizing his maintenance costs had plummeted. Even as headlines warn that EVs are too expensive or that their batteries are dangerously short-lived, real-world economics look different. Battery warranties from Ford, Nissan, and others stretch eight years or more. Major studies reveal 90% of EVs with 100,000 miles still have at least 90% battery capacity. And when it comes to cost, falling battery prices, incentives, and cheaper electricity mean the total cost of ownership for models like the Chevrolet Bolt or Kia EV6 is now on par—sometimes even below—that of comparable petrol vehicles. Maintenance? With 90% fewer moving parts and no oil changes, it’s no contest.

Performance, Range, and Practicality: Today’s EVs in the Real World

Step into the world of enthusiasts like Priya in Los Angeles, who swapped her hatchback for a Lucid Motors Air Grand Touring. The myth that EVs are slow or limited to city streets evaporates on the freeway, where her car covers 837 km (520 miles) on a single charge—more than some gasoline rivals. Whether it’s the instant torque of a Tesla Model S Plaid or the adventurous spirit of a Rivian R1T tackling unpaved trails, EVs today are as thrilling as they are practical. Data from Norway—where EVs outnumber nearly every other type—demonstrates that not only do drivers travel further each year, but range is no longer a barrier. Even in harsh winters, Hyundai and Tesla models excel, with adaptive tech ensuring drivers are rarely caught short.

Job Market, Manufacturing, and the Future of Mobility

Beneath the shift toward electric mobility lies another, less visible revolution. When Ford’s F-150 Lightning rolled off a new assembly line in Michigan, it was more than a product launch—it was a harbinger of change for millions. Contrary to dire warnings about job losses, investments from Chevrolet, Volkswagen, and Polestar are ushering in tens of thousands of new roles, from battery production to software engineering. Recent research even suggests manufacturing EVs may require more labor, at least for now, due to new assembly technologies. The UK alone is poised to add 80,000–100,000 jobs by 2030, contingent on securing manufacturing plants. As Jane tells friends skeptical of “losing jobs to robots,” it’s human adaptation and retraining—supported by industry and government—that is rewriting the workplace, not the end of employment itself.

Frequently Asked Questions: Electric Vehicle Myths Debunked

Do electric vehicles pollute more than gas cars due to battery production?

No. Despite higher initial emissions from battery manufacturing, EVs like the Tesla Model Y pay off their ‘carbon debt’ in one to two years, ultimately reducing lifetime emissions by 65-70% compared to petrol cars.

Are EVs too expensive for the average driver?

Although some models have higher upfront prices, falling battery costs, tax incentives, and much lower maintenance and fueling expenses make EVs like the BYD Dolphin or Chevrolet Bolt highly affordable over their lifespan.

Can EVs be used for long trips and in cold climates?

Absolutely. Models from Lucid Motors, Tesla, and Hyundai now boast 400–800 km ranges, and advanced battery management ensures reliable performance even in freezing temperatures. Norway’s high EV market share supports this with real-world data.

Is the charging infrastructure enough to support millions of EVs?

Yes. Rapidly expanding networks—public and private—along with home charging, now mean that finding a plug is easier than ever, with 4 million+ public chargers worldwide and thousands more coming online monthly.

Do EV batteries last, or will I need to replace mine every few years?

Most EV batteries are rated for 10–15 years and over 300,000 miles, with warranty support and continually improving chemistry. Less than 2% of batteries have needed early replacement in large-scale studies.

Ford Motor Co. unveiled plans for a new line of budget electric vehicles in a $5 billion bid to achieve the mass appeal that has so far eluded its money-losing EV business.

The automaker’s new “universal EV platform” represents its first battery-powered models fully designed from the ground up, after early efforts such as the F-150 Lightning plug-in pickup failed to meet lofty sales expectations.

The new platform will spawn a family of EVs starting with a $30,000 mid-sized pickup truck in 2027, the company said in a statement Monday. That will be followed by battery-powered models expected to include a crossover SUV and a vehicle for ride-hailing, Bloomberg has reported, which will be priced below $40,000, about $10,000 less than the average price of a new car in the US.

Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley has billed the new EV line as Ford’s big bid to take on the growing global dominance of Chinese EV makers such as BYD Co. and Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. It’s part of what Farley called a “tremendous pivot” away from its earlier strategy of electrifying its largest models, which it largely abandoned a year ago when it canceled plans for an electric three-row SUV.

“This is a Model T moment for the company,” Farley told analysts last month, invoking the car that put Ford on the map a century ago. “We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process.”

Farley on Monday cautioned that the strategy around its new EV line might not succeed, especially given how unpredictable the US EV market has been as American car buyers have been slow to embrace electric vehicles.

“There are no guarantees,” Farley told a crowd of workers and politicians at an event at Ford’s Louisville, Kentucky, factory. “It is a bet. There is risk.”

Factory Overhaul

The push includes a new, $2 billion investment to convert Ford’s Louisville plant from producing gasoline-fueled Escape SUVs, a model it is discontinuing, to manufacture the new EV line.

The battery-powered models will take 40% less time to build and require 600 fewer workers than the Escape thanks to an efficient design that was led by former Tesla Inc. executive Alan Clarke in what Ford called a skunk-works project in California. The Louisville plant will employ 2,200 hourly workers to build the EV line, down from 2,800, the company said.

The new models will have more interior room and advanced features, such as hands-free driving. They will be powered by lower-cost lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries Ford is to begin building next year at a new $3 billion battery factory in Marshall, Michigan, the company said.

Farley told reporters after Monday’s plant event that Ford can only beat Chinese automakers by offering an EV with more innovative features and efficient manufacturing methods because Ford can’t beat their low labor costs. “You’ve got to get close on cost, but then you have to apply the innovation,” he said.

Ford deliberately chose not to actually reveal a prototype of the electric pickup coming in two years because it didn’t want to tip its hand to competitors.

Despite Ford’s embrace of smaller, more affordable EVs, the automaker is still moving forward with plans for a successor to the F-150 Lightning full-size pickup. The automaker has repeatedly delayed its next generation electric F-Series truck and has now pushed its launch to mid-2028, from late 2027, according to a person familiar with the change.

Ford said in a statement that it has communicated the timing adjustment to its suppliers and employees in June.

Ford plans to build it at a new $5.6 billion manufacturing compound in Stanton, Tennessee, in 2028. The factory, Ford’s first new assembly plant in a half century, is capable of building more than 300,000 trucks a year, far more than the market is now demanding. It was part of Farley’s now-jettisoned $50 billion plan to churn out 2 million EVs a year by 2026 and overtake Tesla as the market leader in battery powered models.

It remains unclear how Ford will fully utilize its new Tennessee factory, though Farley has suggested the plant could also produce extended-range electric vehicles, a new type of plug-in hybrid.

EV Losses

Ford last year lost $5.1 billion in its EV unit and has said the deficit could widen this year as it brings its new line of battery powered models to life. But Farley has said any new EV at Ford must be both affordable and profitable within its first year on the market. Mainstream consumers have been turned off by the high price of electric vehicles.

“We have all lived through far too many ‘good college tries’ by Detroit automakers to make affordable vehicles that ends up with idled plants, layoffs and uncertainty,” Farley said in a statement.

Ford’s big bet on battery-powered models runs up against President Donald Trump’s crusade against what he calls an “EV mandate.” Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal package is eliminating a $7,500 consumer tax credit on EV purchases and nearly derailed manufacturing subsidies that were critical to Ford’s business case for its Michigan battery plant.

The automaker lobbied furiously to protect those manufacturing credits, including an appeal by Executive Chair Bill Ford, great-grandson of founder Henry Ford.

Ford also said Trump’s tariffs cost the company $800 million in the second quarter and represent a $2 billion headwind for the year. That’s despite the fact that the Dearborn, Michigan-based company produces more cars in America than any other automaker.

“I think the fact that subsidies have been either cut back or limited means that it’s likely that there won’t be future offshore wind built in America.” Halting construction Burgum’s remarks come just weeks after the Interior Department issued a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island.
Five major offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, are under construction.
The three other wind farms under construction are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Sunrise Wind off the coast of New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.
Just this week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) issued her support for the Coast Virginia Offshore Wind Project.","Clean energy advocates hoped that wind power would have a role to play in Trump’s second term, as the administration faces the problem of securing enough power to meet growing demands brought on by the artificial intelligence race.

However, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum insisted this week that offshore wind essentially has no “future” in the United States right now.

“Right now, under this administration, there is not a future,” Burgum said of the industry during the GasTech conference in Milan. “I think the fact that subsidies have been either cut back or limited means that it’s likely that there won’t be future offshore wind built in America.”

Halting construction

Burgum’s remarks come just weeks after the Interior Department issued a stop-work order for the Revolution Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island. It cited unspecified “national security” concerns.

The project, which is being developed by Danish wind giant Ørsted, is estimated to be roughly 80% completed with around 45 out of 65 planned turbines installed. Recent federal court filings revealed that the company is losing roughly $2 million a day over costs incurred from the stop-work order.

However, Ørsted faces billions of dollars’ worth of revenue losses if it cannot meet critical deadlines outlined in its power purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island, according to the Providence Journal. Under the contracts, the wind farm must start generating power by the end of December of next year and mid-January 2027. Otherwise, the utilities could terminate the contracts.

If the project were to be scrapped entirely, officials with Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection warned it could cost consumers up to $500,000, an increase of between 5% and 7% in their electric bills.

“Every day that goes by without a resolution to this largely unexplained stop work order is a waste of American resources,” Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind nonprofit organization Turn Forward, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

“Hundreds of union workers sit idle, wondering if their jobs still exist. Regional grid officials counting on this critical new energy source to stabilize the grid and hold down electricity bills must plan for increased risks to reliability,” Bright added. “And billions of dollars of U.S. infrastructure investment are slowly being drained rather than helping a project come to life.”

Other projects in the air

In the last few weeks, the Trump administration has moved to yank federal permits previously granted to offshore wind projects set to be constructed along the East Coast.

This included construction and operations permits granted to U.S. Wind for the Maryland Offshore Wind Project, also known as MarWin, which was approved by the Biden administration in December 2024.

The wind farm is expected to have up to 114 turbines that will generate enough electricity to power over 718,000 homes.

The Interior Department is also targeting permits granted to SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind off the coast of Massachusetts. All three projects have not yet started construction.

Five major offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, are under construction. Trump previously issued a stop-work order for Empire Wind off the coast of New York. However, it was ultimately lifted after the administration said it had made a deal with Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) to approve two gas pipelines in her state.

The three other wind farms under construction are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts, Sunrise Wind off the coast of New York, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind in Virginia.

Burgum said that all five projects are being reviewed by the administration this week.

“Yes, they were permitted, but they got moved through a very fast, ideologically driven permitting process,” Burgum said.

While permit reviews of such projects are not uncommon at the start of any administration, many in the offshore wind industry have said the Trump administration is going a step too far.

“These particular projects have already been through nearly a decade of rigorous studies and permitting reviews,” Katharine Kollins, president of the Southeastern Wind Coalition, told the Washington Examiner.

“While this administration has shown hostility to the industry, we believe the long-term momentum behind wind energy, which is driven by market demand, technological progress, and private investment, will continue,” Kollins added. “What’s important is that we provide a stable and predictable regulatory environment that allows this industry to provide the domestic energy needed to fuel our economic growth.”

Republican support

As Trump and his allies have rallied against the offshore wind industry, a growing number of Republicans in Congress have directly challenged the crackdown or come out in support of various projects.

Just this week, Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA) issued her support for the Coast Virginia Offshore Wind Project. The project, which is being built by utility Dominion Energy, is set to be the largest offshore wind farm in the country.

Kiggans, who did not openly criticize the administration, said she remains a “staunch” advocate of the project due to the economic development and job growth in the region. She also noted that it has become crucial for meeting energy security demands in Virginia, particularly when it comes to defense.

“I always speak about that project in light of the national security benefit and that benefit to Naval Air Station Oceana,” Kiggans told reporters on Monday. “I have a base here that needs a lot of infrastructure help, and Dominion Energy has been a great partner for us. That public-private partnership is giving Naval Air Station Oceana a $500 million power grid upgrade.”

Similarly, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) offered his support for the project, which has somehow remained unscathed in the administration’s offshore wind crackdown thus far.

“Yes, I’ve talked to the Trump team and there are ongoing conversations about that,” Johnson told E&E News when asked about the Virginia Beach project this week. “I understand the priority for Virginians, and we want to do right by them, so we’ll see.”

WRIGHT BACKS TRUMP ARGUMENT BLAMING RENEWABLES FOR RISING ELECTRICITY PRICES

Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) has also quietly backed the offshore wind farm and reportedly called Burgum last month to voice his support.

However, with Burgum insisting that offshore wind has no “future” and Trump vowing not to let any new windmills be built in the U.S., any public support from Republican industry allies might be for naught.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25237502829235.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-14 12:02:24.013081

The expiration of federal EV tax credits has also contributed to the temporary market spike and further complicated the landscape for Tesla.

The decline in profits is also influenced by the high costs of transforming production lines to meet the demands of EV manufacturing. This includes the development of advanced technologies like autonomous driving and energy solutions, which require significant investments. Additionally, supply chain disruptions, such as semiconductor shortages, have posed substantial challenges in meeting production targets and delivering vehicles on time.

The sector's outlook remains uncertain, with experts predicting that the crisis may persist due to ongoing competition, regulatory pressures, and the need for substantial investments in new technologies.

Membrane innovation boosts speed and stability

A core innovation is a novel ultra-ion-selective membrane called SPEEK-SX. It delivers ionic conductivity while restricting unwanted ions, allowing the battery to operate at high current densities (≈160 mA/cm²) over 600 full charge/discharge cycles with minimal capacity loss (≈0.00935% per cycle). This performance exceeds that of the widely used Nafion-212 membrane, particularly in terms of cycle stability and speed.

Safety, cost and real-world readiness

Unlike many lithium-ion systems, the flow battery uses non-toxic, non-flammable materials and relies on abundant components. It stores energy in liquid electrolytes and uses a membrane barrier system to separate ion streams, making it simpler to scale. Researchers are 3D-printing prototypes and testing under realistic conditions; if results hold, the battery could become commercially available in a few years.

How it compares with lithium systems

Current lithium-ion storage systems used for rooftop solar in many markets cost around USD 10,000. This new flow battery aims to undercut those costs, while offering safety and performance advantages. The fast charging enabled by the membrane means it can more closely match solar output in real time.

Implications for the manufacturing sector

For manufacturers of battery components, membranes, and storage systems, this is a potential game changer. The shift away from expensive, fluorinated separators toward more affordable and safer alternatives opens new supply chain opportunities. Local industries focusing on organic chemistry, polymer membranes and scalable manufacturing methods stand to benefit. There is also demand for R&D in prototype validation and product engineering as adoption moves from lab to market.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/09/14/monash-university.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 12:02:59.121299

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.bigcountryhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/56/2025/09/68c5fc4e13c733.48887980.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:50.794586

Rea, a senior associate with the nonprofit RMI, analyzes the latest plans put out by U.S. electricity utilities for meeting projected demand over the coming decades.

His most recent review of all 128 plans found that utilities were looking to build twice as much natural gas capacity as they had anticipated just 18 months earlier.

The main reason for this shift: Utilities are rushing to accommodate the electricity needs of data centers, and projections of those needs keep rising. It’s a troubling trend for anyone concerned about the costs for ratepayers and the effects on the climate.

“Utilities that have updated their plans since the end of 2023 have added just a small amount of wind and solar capacity, 4 gigawatts, but a lot more gas capacity, 52 gigawatts,” said Rea, whose organization seeks to accelerate the energy transition.

At first glance, utilities’ long-term plans seem to favor renewables overall, projecting wind and solar growth of 258 gigawatts versus natural gas additions of 102 gigawatts through 2035. But a closer look reveals the shift.

Just one year back, these plans showed wind and solar could overtake natural gas as the nation’s biggest source of electricity generation by 2035. At the new rate, gas would keep reigning.

AI Boosts Demand

U.S. tech giants are betting big on an AI future, but the power grid is still a relic of the past.

Data centers—essentially warehouses for computers that form the backbone of the internet—are multiplying as companies add power-hungry servers for artificial intelligence. Some existing sites use as much energy as a small city, and new ones are even bigger.

As a result, data centers, which used less than 2 percent of total U.S. electricity prior to 2018, consumed 4.4 percent in 2023 and are on track to make up anywhere between 6.7 and 12 percent by 2028. That’s according to a congressionally mandated report by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year.

After nearly two decades of flat demand, the power grid—much of it running on equipment that is over half a century old—is scrambling to keep up.

“It was designed to accommodate big central power plants that sent electricity in one direction down the lines to the customers,” said Todd Olinsky-Paul, senior director of the Clean Energy Group’s Resilient Power Project.

It was not built for a system that has much more rooftop solar and home-based batteries, with electricity going to and from the customer.

Energy companies and regulators have been working for years to modernize the grid and move toward cleaner sources of energy. But when faced with a rapid increase in electricity demand, ambitions of just a few years have faded in favor of plans to rely heavily on new natural gas power plants—with everyone bearing the costs, from higher electricity bills to harmful climate impacts.

Resorting to Natural Gas

Experts say that utilities are leaning extensively on gas due in part to the inertia of existing regulatory processes and a tendency of the power sector to hype its demand outlook.

When utilities want to raise rates, they almost always have to make their case in public proceedings before a state commission. In most states, the regulator-approved rate hikes only account for the fixed costs of building new infrastructure, including plants and power lines. The fluctuating cost of the fuel that goes into running those plants is passed through to consumers on a rolling basis year after year.

“Often the fuel price risk is ignored, probably intentionally ignored, by utilities when they speak with their regulators,” said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based consultancy focused on transmission and power markets.

Gramlich, who testified before a Senate committee in July about rising electric demand, previously worked with a Republican chairman of the federal energy regulator as well as with the country’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection.

Among the reasons for utilities to favor gas is the rate-setting process, which makes it more profitable for utilities to opt for power plants in their territory rather than contracting for renewables, Gramlich said.

“Renewables have been a little bit less attractive because often they’re in a neighboring service territory or spread around the region,” he said, and “they’re usually developed and owned by independent power producers.”

Utilities also like to err on the side of caution. To avoid blackouts, they prefer to build more rather than less, which shows up in their off-the-charts projections. Since 2006, their 10-year growth forecasts have overshot reality by 17 percent on average, according to an RMI analysis.

That saddles customers with the bill for unneeded facilities. And it’s a particular risk in the current fast-changing environment.

Utilities are preparing to meet a 24 percent increase in electricity demand by 2035, according to another RMI analysis.

Jeremy Ortiz, a spokesperson for the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group, said in a statement, “Our members are investing more than $1.1 trillion in infrastructure projects nationwide over the next 5 years to help keep costs as low as possible for families and businesses while enabling the innovation America needs to win the AI race.”

Without regulatory changes, the costs will be effectively socialized across the customer base even though much of the growth is coming from one kind of customer—data centers.

“The typical rate-making structures are not set up for this because typically electrical infrastructure—generation, transmission, distribution lines—is paid for by the entire customer base, which is a reasonable assumption when you assume that everything is growing in a similar way,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

But today’s growth is coming from some of the world’s largest corporations, which are sparing no expense to win the AI arms race.

“Because the data centers are so enormous,” Kunkel said, “it’s a different paradigm.”

While this is playing out around the country, the most acute impacts are regionally concentrated. Northern Virginia is the world’s largest hub of data centers—and the utility that serves them, Dominion Energy, raised its capital expenditure by a fifth to $12 billion last year, the largest jump for any investor-owned electric utility in the nation.

Soaring electricity prices in Virginia, and throughout the wider Mid-Atlantic region, have been attributed in large part to data centers.

As Virginia strains to accommodate that growth, “we’re seeing data center companies right now seek out anywhere that they see perceived headroom or ability to power their load throughout the country,” said Lauren Shwisberg, a principal at RMI’s Carbon-Free Electricity Practice.

Against this backdrop, many other states are courting data centers and their tax revenue, following in Virginia’s footsteps.

But data centers don’t produce a lot of permanent local jobs, and they “may be effectively crowding out other forms of economic development” by siphoning large portions of the region’s available electricity away from other types of industrial and manufacturing investments, Kunkel noted.

Meanwhile, sparse information disclosed by data-center developers—and the speculative nature of many proposals on the cutting edge of tech—makes it harder to effectively plan the grid of the near future.

“It is worrisome that we’re going to end up overbuilding generation, particularly overbuilding fossil-fuel generation, which no one wants to see,” Kunkel said.

Blow to Clean Energy

Clean energy is literally waiting in line to help the grid out—and waiting, and waiting.

Another report from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory last year found that 95 percent of energy projects queued up at the end of 2023 for permission from grid operators to get connected were either solar, batteries or wind. The report noted that wait times are rising, from less than two years for projects completed in 2008 to nearly five years for those finished in 2023. Historically, just about one in five projects in the queue get completed.

With all these projects in the pipeline, “we can meet the vast majority of the requirements for many of these data centers with pretty close to exclusively clean energy, if we had both the political apparatus and will to be able to do so,” said Jeremy Fisher, principal advisor on climate and energy with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program, who co-authored a report last September about leveraging growing electric demand for a cleaner grid.

At a federal level, with a president who has made no secret of his disdain for renewables, the will is now entirely absent.

“The cancellation of permits, the difficulty of getting federal permits and the uncertainty and loss of tax credits are all very likely to reduce renewable energy growth in the next few years,” Grid Strategies’ Gramlich said, referring to Trump administration moves to discourage wind and solar. All of that compounds the effects of burgeoning demand, he said, “making clean energy targets more difficult to meet in a number of places.”

Take Virginia’s example. The state passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act in 2020, setting staggered targets, under financial penalty, for investor-owned utilities to keep raising the share of carbon-free electricity in their statewide power sales, topping out at 100 percent in 2045 for Dominion.

But Dominion’s long-term planning indicates that it might miss those targets. In 2023, its modeling showed it might not meet the statutory requirement to retire all carbon-emitting power generation by 2045, citing “an increasing load forecast.” Last year’s plan said it was getting ready to collect fines for some of the years through 2040 when it expects to fall short of the targets. Those fines would pass to customers.

Dominion did not respond to requests for comment.

Even if compliance with the law was possible and compatible with high levels of data center growth, it would require “unprecedented investment in an ‘all-of-the-above’ strategy” on energy. That was the finding of a study released in December by the state legislature’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which also said the state’s current regulatory practices “were not designed to account for this level and continued pace of large load growth from essentially a single customer type.”

In neighboring North Carolina, where data center construction is exploding, the Republican-led state legislature last month dropped a 2030 deadline for utility Duke Energy to slash its carbon emissions by 70 percent.

Risks to Consumers

Already, utility bills are rising as climate change drives more extreme weather and grid hardening costs. Deepening dependence on gas further piles on risks for ratepayers, and not only because gas worsens climate change.

“When [gas prices] spike, that’s an instant rate increase outside the rate-case process that flows directly to your bill,” said Ted Thomas, founder of consultancy Energize Strategies and former chair of the Arkansas Public Service Commission. “If you’re a regulator, your consumers are twisting in the wind if they’re just sitting there eating those costs on both electricity and natural-gas home heating.”

Then there’s the possibility of the political pendulum swinging back. Make energy investment decisions assuming the current federal policy environment won’t change, and “you’re probably going to get hammered,” Thomas said.

“The people that think the only reason to do renewables is environmental, they get it wrong,” Thomas said. His guidance for utility commissioners: “You’ve got to leave your ideology at home. … We can’t pretend that natural gas prices don’t spike because if they do, our constituents are going to have to pay for it.”

Some states are taking a hard look at the other major grid issue posed by data centers: Everyone bearing the costs of that development. In July, utility American Electric Power got buy-in from state regulators in Ohio to make large data centers pay for at least 85 percent of their projected energy use each month, even if they end up needing less. A report that same month from the Clean Energy States Alliance details other ways that officials are trying to make data centers pick up the tab—and stay the course on the clean-energy transition.

“The momentum was always at the state level,” said Olinsky-Paul, a co-author of that report. “States have a very good, effective ability to institute new policy and regulations and new programs to accelerate the deployment of clean energy resources. They know how to do it. They’ve been doing it for decades.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2214908574-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 05:58:51.486591

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the credit—offering up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used ones—is set to expire on September 30, 2025. However, recent IRS clarifications, as detailed in a Yahoo Finance report, allow consumers to secure the incentive by entering a binding contract and making a payment before the deadline, even if the vehicle isn’t delivered until later.

This adjustment addresses a practical hurdle: supply chain delays and inventory shortages that have plagued the auto industry. Buyers who sign a non-refundable agreement or provide a down payment by the cutoff date can still claim the credit on their 2025 tax returns, provided the vehicle meets all other qualifications like battery sourcing and price caps.

Navigating the Binding Contract Loophole

Industry experts view this as a lifeline for an EV market still recovering from post-pandemic disruptions. According to insights from WebProNews, analysts predict a 10-15% sales dip without the credit, but the extension via contracts could mitigate that by encouraging pre-deadline commitments. Dealerships are already adapting, with some offering streamlined online contracting to lock in deals remotely.

For consumers, the key is understanding what constitutes a “binding contract.” The IRS specifies it must be enforceable under state law, with at least a partial payment or trade-in. This echoes guidance from the IRS’s own clean vehicle tax credits page, updated in May 2025, which emphasizes that acquisition is defined by commitment, not possession.

Implications for Automakers and Supply Chains

Automakers like Tesla and General Motors stand to benefit, as the loophole could sustain demand into late 2025. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from users like Sawyer Merritt highlight how the original expiration shift from December 31 to September 30 caught the industry off guard, prompting urgent marketing pushes. Meanwhile, a CNBC analysis notes that this flexibility particularly aids out-of-state purchases, where shipping delays might otherwise disqualify buyers.

Yet, not all vehicles qualify. Eligibility hinges on factors like North American assembly and income limits—$150,000 for single filers, $300,000 for joint. NerdWallet’s July 2025 update on EV tax credits lists models like the Chevrolet Bolt and Ford F-150 Lightning as prime candidates, but warns of potential changes if battery mineral rules tighten further.

Consumer Strategies and Market Shifts

To maximize savings, experts recommend acting swiftly. A NPR report from August underscores that shoppers don’t need keys in hand by September 30, easing pressure on rushed deliveries. This has sparked a flurry of activity, with Consumer Reports noting in its August 2025 piece on qualifying EVs that plug-in hybrids like the Toyota Prius Prime remain strong options amid the deadline.

Looking ahead, the expiration could reshape EV adoption. Without the credit, prices may rise effectively by thousands, potentially slowing the transition to cleaner transport. As Edmunds explores in its coverage of the loophole, this might accelerate innovation in affordable models, but for now, the IRS’s extension offers a critical window for savvy buyers to electrify their drives on favorable terms.

Economic Ripple Effects and Policy Context

Broader economic implications are evident. The credit, extended multiple times since its inception, has subsidized over a million EV purchases, per Department of Energy data from its clean vehicle credits page. X posts from figures like Pramila Jayapal reflect past enthusiasm for such incentives, but with the 2025 cutoff, attention turns to state-level rebates in places like California.

Critics argue the policy favors wealthier buyers, as echoed in older X commentary from Guy Reschenthaler, yet recent IRS tweaks aim for inclusivity. As the September deadline looms, industry insiders advise consulting tax professionals to navigate claims, ensuring this final extension doesn’t slip away unused.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DALL·E-2024-08-09-06.35.54-A-dynamic-image-depicting-the-rapid-rise-of-electric-vehicles-EVs-dominating-the-automotive-landscape.-The-scene-shows-a-futuristic-cityscape-with-h.webp,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:27.113174

1 state for building new small hydropower,"" Brown Kinloch told state lawmakers last year.","Hydropower provides a vast majority of Kentucky's renewable electricity generation, and many unused dams could offer an opportunity for more.

Unlike other technologies like solar and wind, hydropower has seen broad bipartisan support, from the White House to the Kentucky legislature.

Upfront cost and a lengthy licensing process remain steep barriers for hydropower projects, and can disproportionately affect the smaller projects more common in Kentucky.

When it was built nearly a century ago, the Ohio Falls hydroelectric dam churned out enough power to serve nearly the entire budding city of Louisville.

Adorned by wooden handrails, vintage analog gauges and original tile, the plant's eight turbine units still chug away today, producing carbon-free electricity from the Ohio River. Anglers, water birds and wildlife congregate around the historic structure, jutting off of Shippingport Island along the McAlpine locks and dam system.

Louisville's power demand outgrew the station's generating capacity many years ago. But with a recent modernization effort, LG&E expects the station to persist for yet another century, meeting the electricity needs of tens of thousands of homes.

The Ohio Falls generating station is one of about a dozen hydroelectric plants operating in Kentucky waters.

Dozens more of Kentucky's existing dams could be suitable for hydroelectric generation but have not yet been developed — offering an opportunity to grow Kentucky's share of the oldest form of renewable energy. That opportunity is vast: The commonwealth has more miles of navigable water than any other state after Alaska, and many rivers and streams are already dammed from past efforts to shape these watersheds.

But developers say hydroelectric projects in states like Kentucky face significant hurdles, including an arduous federal licensing process and the need for long-term investment. Turbines are typically custom-designed and manufactured, posing another costly challenge.

Nevertheless, several hydroelectric projects are moving forward in Kentucky, and proponents see momentum and cause for optimism in the industry. Hydropower has enjoyed bipartisan favor, even amid the Trump administration's efforts to reverse federal support for other renewable energy technologies like wind and solar.

Building upon eligible, existing dams could yield hundreds of megawatts of reliable and renewable electricity, by some estimates. Additionally, by installing new hydropower generation without building new dams, developers avoid some of the knotty environmental challenges of reworking river systems.

Once stations do come online, they offer a reliable, carbon-free power source, often for a century or more. In fact, the U.S. Energy Information Administration in 2017 assessed all power plants built before 1930 and still in operation across the country. Hydroelectric stations made up 99% of the capacity.

""Hydro is now being called the forever renewable,"" Kentucky hydropower developer David Brown Kinloch said, ""because these plants last forever.""

Kentucky's leading source of clean power

Hydroelectric power plants function by a relatively simple premise: Water flows downstream and through a turbine, causing it to spin, which in turn runs a generator.

Plants harness the kinetic energy of moving water ― a concept applied in some form since at least the days of ancient Greece ― to generate electricity. The volume or flow of the water and the elevation change at the point of the dam determine the potential generation.

Louisville's Ohio Falls station, which sits at the single highest drop in the entire 981-mile length of the Ohio River, is in a particularly opportune location. Each of the station's eight turbine units can take in 4,000 cubic feet of water per second from the river, at capacity.

""The taller the dam, the more power you can make,"" Brown Kinloch said.

In Kentucky, hydropower is often generated in a run-of-river context, harnessing the natural flow of a waterway. It's also implemented in lakes and reservoirs, like Kentucky Utilities' Dix Dam at Herrington Lake.

Hydroelectric stations made up roughly 7% of Kentucky's electricity generation and a vast majority of its renewable power in 2022, with solar still fighting to gain ground. Dams in Kentucky waterways collectively generate millions of megawatt hours each year. (A power plant would need to burn billions of pounds of coal to generate the same amount.)

But the remaining 93% of the state's electricity generation came from polluting and planet-warming fossil fuels: coal and gas. Kentucky's electric power industry emits more than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide or equivalent emissions each year ― more than the state's transportation and agriculture sectors combined, according to EPA data.

Increasing the generation of carbon-free power and curtailing emissions from burning fossil fuels is mandatory for avoiding the worst consequences of climate change, according to the world's leading experts.

Hydropower's momentum in Kentucky, where conservative politics has slowed efforts for a clean energy transition, is part of a larger effort to chip away at stubborn power sector emissions.

Appalachian Hydro Associates, Brown Kinloch's development firm, is building a number of small hydroelectric projects up and down the Kentucky River. The firm has also partnered with Berea College on some projects, including a completed station near Ravenna.

And in Bell County, a billion-dollar pumped storage project is progressing with the help of some federal dollars.

But a burdensome federal licensing process and difficulty finding long-term investors can pose formidable hurdles for hydro projects, experts said. Installing hydro in an existing dam can take a decade or more, depending on the need for environmental assessments and other steps.

""When you go to most investors, they're wondering, 'What's the profit next quarter?'"" Brown Kinloch said. ""And you're talking about a project that's got a 100-year life, at minimum.""

Brown Kinloch said his firm has partnered Berea College because it also has taken the long view.

""They're not so concerned about whether the thing is making money in the first two months,"" he said. ""They realize it's a long-term investment.""

The bipartisan appeal of hydropower

In 1983, a state report analyzed potential sites for hydropower at existing dams across the commonwealth. Brown Kinloch has a copy; the pages have yellowed, but many of the dams it lists have yet to be developed.

Last year, he presented some of these statistics to a committee of state lawmakers, some of them staunch allies of the coal industry who have rejected the merits of decarbonizing Kentucky's power sector.

Installing hydroelectric systems in dozens of existing dams across the state could yield more than 600 megawatts of reliable electricity, Brown Kinloch explained — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes.

Lawmakers were impressed.

""This seems to me to be a much more intelligent application of resources than, you know, basically future garbage dumps that we're building with all these solar projects,"" Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, said of hydropower during the committee meeting.

""When you look at all the energy aspects, and you see all the solar farms and you see all the potential harm that it can do to our farmlands and things, our return on investment isn't that great with some of these renewables,"" said Rep. Ryan Dotson, R-Winchester. ""But with hydro, I see the great potential in it.""

Party leaders, while remaining staunch in their defense of fossil fuels, have expressed concerns about electricity shortages and price hikes, especially as data centers and other energy-hungry industries take root around the state.

Hydropower boasts relatively low operation and maintenance costs. Dams also don't face the fuel input costs of coal- or gas-fired power plants, although operators do pay a fee to the federal government for use of the waterway.

Also, hydroelectric stations can generally operate for a larger portion of the year than solar or wind, although periods of flooding or drought — too much or too little water — can impede generation.

""Hydropower really does enjoy huge bipartisan support,"" said Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association. ""It appeals to both sides of the aisle.""

Alongside oil, gas, coal and nuclear, President Donald Trump has indicated his support for hydropower — ""which is fantastic,"" he said on the campaign trail — showing favor over other forms of renewable energy technologies.

Some of Trump's energy-related executive orders prioritize hydropower, and the president's domestic policy megabill spared key incentives for the hydro industry while crippling Biden-era support for other renewables, like solar and wind.

""If you're conservative, you like that it's baseload. It's not intermittent, like wind and solar,"" Woolf said. ""You like that it's domestic and secure. You understand it, because it's been around for 100 years.""

Hydropower projects moving forward in Kentucky

Even the industry's most fervent proponents admit hydroelectric dams are unlikely to ever generate a significant portion of Kentucky’s modern energy needs, especially as demand is expected to surge.

""Hydropower is not going to solve all of Kentucky's problems,"" Brown Kinloch said.

But it could still have a valuable role, even without the construction of new dams. Several new developments are forging ahead in the state, from small hydropower installations to larger investments.

Together, Brown Kinloch said, ""they're going to add up.""

Along the upper reaches of the Kentucky River, Brown Kinloch's firm is building a series of small hydroelectric stations on existing dams. Once complete, these projects will generate enough power for thousands of homes.

A station at lock 12, near Ravenna, is already in service ― and named for Matilda Hamilton Fee, the ""first lady"" of Berea College at its founding.

Another similarly sized station at lock 7, near Shakertown in Mercer County, is named for Mother Ann Lee, a religious leader of the Shakers. Inside, turbine housings are painted in bright colors and embellished with the artwork of schoolchildren.

""I took those plates off and took them over to my daughter's elementary school, and they painted the fish of the Kentucky River on there,"" Brown Kinloch said. ""So, it's a kids' art gallery also.""

In Bell County, a proposed project would add 266 megawatts of pumped storage on a former coal mine. Rather than generating power, pumped storage acts as a ""water battery,"" and this project would store electricity for up to 8 hours at a time, available for dispatchable use as needed to help stabilize the grid.

Rye Development is investing more than $1 billion in the project, which is named Lewis Ridge. It's expected to create 2,300 construction jobs.

Republicans representing the area have praised the Lewis Ridge plans. State Sen. Scott Madon, of nearby Pineville, called it a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity for Eastern Kentucky communities to build upon their energy-producing legacy,"" and an economic boon for the region.

""As we grow our economy, it's vital that Kentucky strengthen our energy system through common-sense solutions like the Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project,"" U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers said in a news release. ""Additionally, this project will help keep energy prices stable and affordable for Kentuckians.""

An 'extremely broken' regulatory process

Despite hydropower's momentum on the Kentucky River and elsewhere, industry experts say long timelines still pose formidable hurdles. Licensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can take years.

""The process is and has been, for many, many years, extremely broken,"" Brown Kinloch said.

The licensing process for a pair of relatively small hydroelectric projects on the Kentucky River, he added, took more than seven years.

The regulatory process is designed to ensure a hydropower project won't cause harm to the environment, recreation or other resources. In some cases, hydroelectric projects can pose a threat to fish, mussels and other species, although modern turbine designs and other tactics have sought to reduce harm. The Mother Ann Lee dam on the Kentucky River, and the Meldahl station on the Ohio, are both certified by the Low Impact Hydropower Association for taking measures to reduce disruption of the environment.

The federal government itself has recognized the licensing process can inflict undue cost and delays to building new hydroelectric infrastructure, even in projects with minimal controversy. A Department of Energy report found the arduous licensing process can disproportionately hinder smaller projects ― such as those fit for Kentucky's existing dams.

One piece of legislation, which the National Hydropower Association called a ""critical first step"" toward streamlining the licensing process, recently passed in the U.S. House of Representatives with bipartisan backing. It would require regulators to report to Congress with regular updates on the licensing process for each application.

Industry advocates said easing licensing barriers could be key to unlocking more hydroelectric projects ― especially in states like Kentucky, where hydropower has proven politically palatable in ways solar and other clean energy technologies have not.

""Kentucky is the No. 1 state for building new small hydropower,"" Brown Kinloch told state lawmakers last year. ""And it is our intent to build a whole industry centered here in Kentucky, with component suppliers and everything to supply small hydro, and teach the rest of the country how to do it.""","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/05/PLOU/85531689007-hydro-03.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y120&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-14 05:58:55.231397

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Electricity Isn’t the Only Concern

There have also been recent reports about the amount of water data centers are using that have caused concern among communities impacted by tech companies moving in next door.

A data center in Georgia, operated by Facebook’s parent company Meta, is said to use roughly 500,000 gallons of water daily to cool their computing equipment. This amounts to about 10% of water use in the county, roughly equivalent to the demand of about 1,600 homes. Newer AI data centers are expected to use more than a millions gallons daily, according to water permit applications. Some have even asked for as many as six million gallons of water per day.

In some areas it has been suggested that residents may have to start rationing water by 2030, all so the tech companies can keep pushing their hot new product.

Data Centers Are Threatening Grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states, and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma, and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data Centers Might Have to Adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s Largest Grid Operator Has a Proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A Deal is Shrouded in Secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A New Way of Thinking About Electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

Taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://www.poncacitynow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Amazon-Data-Center-08-22-2024-AP.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:59:03.473407

The challenge is to leverage what remains of coal’s economic utility to accelerate, rather than delay, the clean energy pivot.
The clean energy era is not about erasing the past; it is about harnessing it to finance and secure a more sustainable future.","Jakarta, IO – Every era of a nation’ s development has its emblematic resource. For Indonesia, coal has long played that role. From the sprawling mines of Kalimantan to the busy ports along Sumatra’s coast, coal has not only powered turbines but also filled state coffers, paid for schools, hospitals and roads, and served as a diplomatic bargaining chip in global trade. Yet as the world edges ever closer to a clean energy future, Indonesia’s reliance on coal stands at a critical juncture. President Prabowo Subianto’s ambitious pledge to move toward 100 percent renewable energy within a decade underscores both the urgency and the opportunity of this moment. The pressing question is not whether coal will decline, but how it will be repositioned in the nation’s evolving energy landscape.

Coal’s legacy is both monumental and contradictory. On one hand, it has been the backbone of Indonesia’s electrification drive, enabling the lights to switch on in rural villages and industrial estates alike. The state has long depended on royalties and taxes from coal exports, particularly to energy-hungry neighbors in Asia. In 2022 alone, coal exports generated more than US$45 billion in foreign exchange, making it one of the largest contributors to Indonesia’s trade surplus. The resource has also created jobs across mining provinces, anchoring local economies and political networks. Yet this success has come with undeniable costs: deforestation, polluted rivers, respiratory illness among neighboring inhabitants from particulate emissions, and a carbon footprint that has placed Indonesia among the world’s top greenhouse gas emitters.

Globally, the coal narrative has shifted with remarkable speed. Banks, insurers and sovereign wealth funds have withdrawn financing from coal projects. Multilateral institutions now view coal as a “stranded asset” waiting to happen. Across Asia, long a bastion of coal demand, countries from China to India are scaling up renewable capacity at unprecedented rates. For Indonesia, which exports around 70 percent of its coal, this shift threatens to erode a vital stream of income. Domestically, the commitment to decarbonization, enshrined in the Paris Agreement and Indonesia’s net-zero pledge by 2060, further accelerates the imperative to transform. The recently-updated National Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) reflects this pivot, slating the majority of new capacity additions to come from renewables rather than coal-fired plants.

Yet phasing coal out of the grid is only part of the story. A more strategic question is how to reposition coal in a way that preserves its economic value, while aligning with the clean energy vision. Simply abandoning coal is neither feasible nor fiscally prudent. Instead, coal must be reframed not as an enemy of the transition but as a resource that, if managed wisely, can serve as a bridge to Indonesia’s clean energy era.

One avenue is industrial repositioning through downstream development. Indonesia has already experimented with coal gasification, aiming to convert coal into dimethyl ether (DME) as a substitute for imported LPG. Similar pathways exist for coal-to-methanol, coal-to-ammonia, and other petrochemicals that could supply domestic industry. While the environmental credentials of such technologies remain contested, particularly if carbon capture is not employed, they represent an attempt to move coal higher up the value chain. Rather than exporting raw coal, Indonesia could extract more economic rent by transforming it into intermediate products that support fertilizer, plastics, or chemical industries. This would mirror the government’s broader strategy of resource nationalism, exemplified by the nickel downstreaming push.

Another, perhaps more compelling, role for coal is as a fiscal buffer. Just as Norway built its sovereign wealth fund from oil revenues, Indonesia could channel the remaining windfall from coal into a “clean energy transition fund.” Such a mechanism would ensure that coal rents are not squandered on short-term expenditures but rather invested in renewable infrastructure, grid modernization and worker retraining. With careful design, this fund could become a stabilizing pillar for energy transition, insulating the state budget from commodity price volatility while underwriting longterm resilience. The analogy is not perfect; coal is far dirtier than oil, and time is shorter but the principle of converting resource wealth into future security remains powerful.

Coal could also serve as a strategic energy buffer. Even as renewable energy expands, intermittency and reliability issues will persist, especially in archipelagic regions where grid integration is costly. Maintaining limited coal reserves as an emergency fallback, akin to a strategic petroleum reserve, could help Indonesia hedge against supply disruptions, whether from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions or sudden demand surges. This does not mean prolonging the dominance of coal in the power mix, but rather reimagining it as a backup, a form of insurance in the broader resilience framework.

Of equal importance is the social dimension of the coal transition. Millions of Indonesians rely directly or indirectly on the coal economy, from miners in East Kalimantan to truck drivers, port workers and small traders in mining towns. Abrupt closure of coal operations would devastate these communities, fueling unemployment, poverty and social unrest. A just transition requires deliberate planning: channeling coal revenues into retraining programs, supporting micro-enterprises in affected regions and investing in new industries – ones that can absorb displaced workers. Provinces that once thrived on coal should not be left behind in the clean energy era. Instead, they should be recast as hubs for such renewable energy development as solar farms on reclaimed mining land, wind turbines along coastal ridges, or biomass plants tapping local resources.

The repositioning of coal also demands robust institutional frameworks. Without strong governance, efforts at downstreaming or fiscal reallocation risk succumbing to rent-seeking, inefficiency or even corruption. Transparent mechanisms for managing coal revenues must be established, with clear lines of accountability, to ensure that every Rupiah serves the transition. Likewise, the coal-to-clean narrative must be embedded within a broader strategy of national energy resilience, not treated as an ad hoc policy experiment. Coordination across ministries, local governments, stateowned enterprises, and the private sector will be critical.

Repositioning coal in this manner does not imply romanticizing its role. The environmental costs remain steep, and no amount of rebranding can obscure its carbon intensity. However, realism is essential. Coal will not disappear overnight, nor can Indonesia afford to sever its dependence without careful preparation. The challenge is to leverage what remains of coal’s economic utility to accelerate, rather than delay, the clean energy pivot.

In this respect, Indonesia has an opportunity to craft a uniquely Indonesian model of transition. Rather than importing blueprints wholesale from Europe or North America, the country can integrate its own historical experiences, developmental priorities and social realities. Coal repositioning can be framed not as capitulation to external pressure but as an assertion of energy sovereignty; redirecting a domestic resource to serve long-term national resilience. Such a framing would resonate with the ethos of Article 33 of the Constitution, which mandates that natural resources be harnessed for the greatest prosperity of the people.

The international community will also be watching closely. How Indonesia manages coal will influence its credibility as a climate actor and shape investor confidence in the broader energy sector. If the country demonstrates that coal revenues are being transparently and strategically reinvested into clean energy, it could unlock greater flows of climate finance, concessional loans and technology partnerships. Conversely, if coal is merely prolonged under the guise of transition, skepticism will grow, potentially deterring the very investment needed to achieve the renewable vision.

The narrative power of repositioning coal lies in turning a liability into leverage. Coal built Indonesia’s industrial past, but it does not have to be an albatross around the neck of its future. By converting its fiscal benefits into renewable investment, transforming its industrial role into higher-value products and using its reserves as a strategic buffer, coal can be recast as an enabler of the clean energy era, rather than its obstacle.

The stakes are high. Indonesia’s aspiration to become a green industrial powerhouse by 2045 will falter if coal is mishandled. But if managed wisely, coal could serve as the launchpad for the next chapter of national development, one in which energy security, economic resilience, and environmental stewardship converge.

In the end, the story of coal in Indonesia will be judged not by how long it persisted, but by how wisely it was repositioned. The clean energy era is not about erasing the past; it is about harnessing it to finance and secure a more sustainable future. Coal lit Indonesia’s path to prosperity. Now it must fund the journey toward sovereignty in a cleaner, more resilient age.",https://cdn.observerid.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Feiral-Rizky-Batubara-2.webp,N,,2025-09-14 05:58:35.730966

LAS VEGAS, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Exhibitors at RE+, North America's largest clean energy expo in Las Vegas, warned that U.S. tariffs and policy uncertainty pose major challenges for the global renewable energy industry, disrupting supply chains and complicating project planning.

The expo, held from Monday to Thursday, brought together exhibitors and industry professionals worldwide to showcase the latest solar, wind and energy storage technologies, explore new products, forge partnerships, and discuss trends shaping the renewable energy sector.

Behind the bustling exhibition halls, however, many companies voiced concerns over tariff-driven cost pressures and supply chain disruptions.

""Tariff hikes have brought significant cost pressure, forcing companies to pass the increases on to downstream customers, namely the end consumers,"" said Cheng Wang, CEO of Xenerpower, a Texas-based maker of transformers, switchgears and switchboards.

The uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and clean energy policies, along with rising costs, could severely impact the U.S. clean energy sector, particularly the solar and wind industries, Wang told Xinhua.

""When subsidies were in place, companies could fully cover their costs and even receive additional financial support. Now, with tax incentives removed and stricter approval standards, many projects have been forced to pause or be canceled,"" Wang noted.

For Premier PV, an Arkansas-based solar solutions company, tariffs are complicating component sourcing.

""For the parts and the raw materials, we do have quite a bit of supplies from Europe, the DC feeder cables come from either China or India, and lugs from India,"" said Brian Moore, the company's director of business development.

""There's some tariff the international components will carry ... at one point this year, the tariff went up to 125 percent. It's crazy. But it didn't actually go through, so it got reduced down,"" Moore added.

On U.S. energy policy, Moore said that President Donald Trump's administration has not actively supported renewable energy development.

""Trump keeps fighting against renewable energy. At the same time, for energy independence, the fastest to deploy is generally going to be renewable energy. At least for the next four or five years, we really don't see a way for them to get around it. That's a trend,"" he said.

He added that independent of government subsidies, tech companies with high energy demands -- such as data centers -- are likely to continue pursuing renewable energy projects.

Some companies are taking a wait-and-see approach as they navigate the volatile tariff environment.

Jeannette Holton, senior communications manager at EcoFlow, a multinational specializing in portable power and home solar systems, told Xinhua the company is closely monitoring the situation and will reassess its pricing strategy as needed.

""Our business model isn't really focused on the tariff situation, because we know it's always up and down, and it's constantly changing,"" she said.

Looking ahead, Wang said the future of U.S. clean energy remains uncertain, with corporate planning and investment under heavy pressure. ■",,N,,2025-09-14 06:58:41.840831

In Detail : Union Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy (HDK) announced that fiscal incentives are being planned to encourage domestic production of rare earth magnets. These measures aim to reduce India’s reliance on imports and strengthen the local supply chain for critical materials.

Rare earth magnets are essential for various high-tech applications, including renewable energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics. By producing them locally, India can secure strategic resources crucial for industrial growth.

The proposed incentives are expected to make domestic manufacturing financially viable. Support could include tax breaks, subsidies, or capital expenditure assistance to attract investment in rare earth magnet production facilities.

HDK highlighted the importance of developing a robust ecosystem for rare earth materials. Local production of magnets will complement initiatives for mining, refining, and processing critical minerals within India.

Domestic manufacturing is also expected to create employment opportunities across technical, engineering, and production roles. Skill development programs may be integrated to ensure a trained workforce capable of supporting high-precision magnet production.

The move aligns with India’s broader strategic goals of self-reliance in critical technologies. Reducing import dependence strengthens energy security and enhances competitiveness in global high-tech sectors.

As buyers race against the clock ahead of the October 1 deadline, projections indicate that while this surge is likely to lead to an immediate influx of EV purchases, a subsequent decline in sales is expected once the incentives are no longer available.

Historically, the financial benefits provided through these tax credits have played a vital role in encouraging consumers to transition to electric vehicles. However, industry analysts suggest that the advantages of owning an EV extend beyond initial incentives. Many new EV owners who are experiencing the benefits of electric driving—such as cost savings on fuel, reduced maintenance needs, and the convenience of home charging—are expected to share their positive experiences with friends and family. This word-of-mouth marketing could catalyze a broader shift in consumer attitudes toward EVs.

As new buyers take the plunge and enjoy the advantages of their electric vehicles, a ripple effect may occur. Those who are influenced by these early adopters—co-workers, friends, and relatives—might become more inclined to consider an EV for their next vehicle purchase, even in the absence of financial incentives. While some consumers may initially hesitate to make a purchase immediately after the credits expire, feeling they may have missed out on savings, the overall awareness and interest in electric vehicles could still lead to additional sales over time.

There is also a discussion around the timing and impact of the EV purchase surge. Some argue that the tax credits, if retained, might support a steadier growth of EV sales over time, easing the transition for consumers. Yet, there’s an interesting perspective suggesting that the accelerated sales during this window could set off a cascading effect as early adopters ignite further interest. This phenomenon could potentially lead to quicker adoption rates among the broader population, pushing society closer to the goal of reaching 50% EV sales sooner.

The potential for a cyclical pattern—where incentives are phased out, leading to an immediate surge, followed by a return of incentives—has also been considered. Such a cycle might not only promote an explosive burst of sales but also ensure renewed support mechanisms for EV buyers in the future.

As the deadline for these financial incentives approaches, the electric vehicle market stands at a pivotal junction, with upcoming consumer behaviors and industry shifts likely to shape the landscape of EV adoption well into the future.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Surge-in-Electric-Vehicle-Purchases-Anticipated-Before-Tax-Credit-Expiration.jpeg,N,,2025-09-14 04:58:03.278924

The European Union has threatened retaliatory tariffs, including on Kentucky bourbon.
What does that mean for Kentucky bourbon makers?","Bankers aren’t typically required to wear a uniform, but for a while, many did: a dark Patagonia vest with a dress shirt and slacks.

The look was so widely associated with finance that it developed a nickname, the “Midtown Uniform,” a reference to the New York City neighborhood known for its many investment banks and law firms. It even had an Instagram account with 168,000 followers.

When he unexpectedly found himself at the helm of a successful clothing company, it provoked an identity crisis of sorts. Even when he couldn’t make payroll, Chouinard refused to accept outside investments or consider an initial public offering. He declined offers to sell the company to Berkshire Hathaway and Ralph Lauren, and early on turned down the promise of a $100 million payday if he let the investment bank Robertson Stephens lead an I.P.O.

Although he ultimately became a billionaire himself, Chouinard boasted of his children that “both believe that billionaires represent a policy failure,” adding: “They were brought up right.”

Patagonia pared back sales to financial and tech firms in 2019, uncomfortable with having its products become hot commodities on Wall Street. Many of those Patagonia vests were issued to interns on orientation day and tossed aside a few months later when the interns moved on to a new job. That kind of disposable mind-set was antithetical to Chouinard, who wanted to make things that lasted a lifetime.

It wasn’t the first time he had deliberately throttled the company’s growth, fearing that it would be impossible to scale the business without compromising his high environmental and ethical standards. In 2011, Patagonia ran an ad in The New York Times that read “Don’t Buy This Jacket.”

And still, the company kept getting bigger, establishing a reputation as a small corporation with a big cultural influence.

Forbes magazine placed Chouinard on its annual list of billionaires in 2017, pegging his net worth at a cool $1 billion.

It made Chouinard livid. “It really, really pissed me off,” he said.

His reaction stood in sharp contrast to most American billionaires, many of whom flaunt their fortunes. But material possessions never meant much to Chouinard, who still lives in a log cabin cluttered with secondhand furniture and cooks off the same cast iron skillet he’s had for 50 years.

In 2022, determined to get off the Forbes list, Chouinard resolved to get rid of his wealth once and for all. He considered selling to a like-minded billionaire, handing ownership of the company over to its employees or reincorporating in Switzerland or Denmark, countries that accommodate charitable corporations.

But none of those options satisfied all of Chouinard’s requirements, which included ridding himself of his billionaire status, protecting the integrity of Patagonia and funneling more money to causes like conservation.

In the end, he and his family took the unusual step of giving away their equity in Patagonia to a new series of trusts and nonprofit organizations that now distribute the company’s profits to environmental activism. (Critics accused them of dodging taxes.)

It was a complex transaction, full of legal intricacies and complex paperwork, and Chouinard and his team didn’t do it alone.

Rather, to figure out how to get the deal done, they hired a merchant bank, BDT — just the kind of place where you’d find analysts wearing the Midtown Uniform.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

The Murdoch family settled a yearslong feud over the future of its media empire. Rupert Murdoch’s elder son, Lachlan, has cemented his place as leader of the powerful conservative media outlet after the family agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal. Three Murdoch siblings — Prue, Liz and James — will get $1.1 billion each for their shares in the family business in return for ending their succession fight.

The Ellison family is said to be eyeing a megamedia roll-up. A deal would combine Paramount Global, the media group controlled by David Ellison, with Warner Bros. Discovery — potentially bringing CNN, CBS News, HBO Max and Paramount Plus under one roof. Shares of both companies rose on the report. It was a momentous week for Ellison’s father, Larry, a co-founder of Oracle, who briefly became the world’s wealthiest man after the tech giant reported a knockout forecast.

Traders upped the odds for interest-rate cuts. The futures market was forecasting yesterday that the Federal Reserve would lower its benchmark lending-rate three times this year after jobless claims rose to a four-year high. That’s even though the Consumer Price Index on Thursday showed inflation on a re-accelerating path. Another factor: The Trump administration moved a step closer to getting Stephen Miran, a close adviser to the president, nominated to the central bank in time for next week’s meeting.

Other big deals: Oracle said it had added hundreds of billions of dollars in future contract revenue during its most recent quarter, sending its shares skyrocketing (and briefly making its co-founder Larry Ellison the world’s richest person). OpenAI took a big step toward reorganizing as a for-profit. Giorgio Armani’s will directs heirs to sell an initial 15 percent stake in his company within 18 months. And Air Taxis get another boost from President Trump.

Kentucky’s governor wants Democrats to get real

And he has become a force for renewable energy development in his coal state. Under his watch over the last six years, Kentucky has attracted two electric vehicle battery plants totaling $8 billion in investment. In August, the governor scored another clean energy victory, securing a $2 billion investment from Ford Motor to remake its Louisville plant into an electric truck hub.

Those investments have helped counter the nearly 15,000 coal jobs lost in the state since 2011. But Beshear’s clean energy agenda faces mounting hurdles. President Trump has pushed forward policies that undercut the electric vehicle industry, creating uncertainty that contributed to a halt in hiring at one of Kentucky’s electric vehicle battery plants.

Beshear spoke to DealBook about his plans to make Kentucky an E.V. powerhouse, whether a 2028 presidential run is on the horizon and what can be done about the rise in political violence. The interview has been condensed and edited.

The Trump administration has cut the federal government’s $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles, and many analysts expect sales to dip after it expires. Why make a bet on electric vehicles now?

A lot of people have tried to fight the future, and none of them have ever won. E.V.s are coming. They will be a significant part, if not a dominant part, of the automotive economy.

When I look at the rollback of the E.V. credits, yes, I’m disappointed with the president, but I’m really disappointed with Kentucky Representative Brett Guthrie, who pushed that bill through the House. Guthrie has both Kentucky’s BlueOval battery plant, which will employ 5,000 people, and the Envision plant, which will employ 2,000 people, in his district.

Ford delayed production of its electric truck at the BlueOval plant to 2028. What makes you confident Ford’s latest investment in the state will go through?

You don’t build a multibillion-dollar facility if you’re not going to use it. Ford has repeatedly assured me that it’s only a matter of when, and not a matter of if. I take them at their word. I believe the private sector is showing people very clearly that the economy is and will continue to head in the E.V. direction.

Beyond the electric vehicle industry, President Trump’s tariffs have dealt a blow to your state’s bourbon industry, which produces 95 percent of the world’s bourbon.

The other 5 percent is counterfeit.

Ha. Many Canadian provinces have stopped importing alcoholic beverages from the U.S. The European Union has threatened retaliatory tariffs, including on Kentucky bourbon. What does that mean for Kentucky bourbon makers?

Donald Trump’s tariff policy is the most destructive economic policy I’ve seen in my lifetime. What’s happening with bourbon is both the result of tariffs and the president’s misguided foreign policy. So tariffs are impacting the E.U., and the countermeasures that we’re seeing with bourbon in Canada, it’s primarily that the president has insulted them over and over.

Your podcast was recently picked up by SiriusXM. You’ve said that the show is meant to demonstrate a kind of realness you don’t often see in politicians. What do you mean by that?

Oftentimes all you see from a governor or a senator or even a C.E.O. are their policies. But we need to see each other more as human beings, especially right now.

When we get there, we can create grace and space to disagree on some things, but come together on others. So when I describe the reason that I veto anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, I talk about it being because of my faith. I believe all children are children of God and we shouldn’t be picking on them. That provides a different way that people can hear someone who is disagreeing with them, and help them recognize that they’re maybe doing it for the right reasons.

Do you think Democrats are going to need more of that realness in 2028?

Democrats need to communicate across as many new platforms as possible and haven’t. That’s why I think that Gov. Gavin Newsom’s podcast is really important. Mine tries not to be an overly political voice. I want to make sure it’s a place where people can come and process all this complicated, difficult news.

Are you planning to run in 2028?

Right now I’m out there trying to be a reasonable voice in the chaos, to be a voice of common sense, common ground and getting things done. Next year, I’m fully committed to this job as governor and being the head of the Democratic Governors Association. And then after that, we’ll sit down with my family and I, and we’ll consider it.

Charlie Kirk was assassinated on Wednesday. His killing is the latest incident in a surge of political violence. I’m wondering what you think can be done to address this trend.

What happened yesterday is awful. Leaders have a choice right now to say that violence is wrong no matter who it’s perpetrated against, or to say violence is wrong when it’s perpetrated against people like me or that I agree with now. Now is the time to take the stand to say all of it’s wrong and all of it has to end.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/13/business/13DB-PATAGONIA-VEST2/13DB-PATAGONIA-VEST2-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 00:58:09.898420

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.
The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year. They touted the package as historic.

“We extended California’s cap-and-trade program, the cornerstone of our climate strategy, balancing ambition with affordability,” said Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Democrat.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

But a group of environmental justice groups, including the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment and the California Environmental Justice Alliance, said the bill lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” they said in a statement. “The real failure — and the urgent work ahead — lies in reconciling California’s climate rhetoric to the reality of our communities on the ground.”

GOP lawmakers say cap and trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The facility will transform forest byproducts, such as sustainably sourced wood waste and thinnings, into low-carbon fuels like renewable naphtha and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Governor Greg Abbott announced the project in 2022 with an initial $1.7 billion investment, which is expected to create over 140 permanent jobs. USA BioEnergy has secured more than 1,600 acres in Bon Wier for the refinery, aiming to turn an idle property into a clean energy hub by 2025.

The refinery has entered a 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines for up to 680 million gallons of SAF. The facility plans to produce between 34 million and 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually, contingent on the final design. USA BioEnergy confirmed the implementation of Honeywell’s Experion PKS control system at the Bon Wier plant, with Johnson Matthey also joining as a technology collaborator.

""By utilizing forest thinnings for bioenergy production with carbon capture and sequestration technologies, our integration with technology providers like Honeywell will help us create a fully integrated, alternative fuels solution,"" said Nick Andrews, CEO of USA BioEnergy.

The project is benefiting from approximately $150 million in state, county, and federal credits and tax incentives. Local support includes organizations such as the Texas Forest Country Partnership, Texas Forestry Association, and the City of Newton.

""This advanced-fuels facility development milestone underscores USA BioEnergy’s commitment to the future of aviation and energy security,"" Andrews said in a February statement. ""We also appreciate the opportunity to create good-paying jobs in Newton County, Texas, which has one of the lowest per capita incomes in the state. We are proud this project is a win-win-win for the area, the industry, and our business objectives.""

Once operational, the plant is expected to employ roughly 200 people full-time, alongside several hundred construction jobs during the build-out phase. The facility will also provide a new market for East Texas forestry byproducts, abundant in Newton and surrounding counties.

Despite the land purchase and new technology partnerships, construction has not yet begun. USA BioEnergy says engineering and design work is ongoing, with construction expected to take about two years once it starts. Full operations are projected for 2028 or 2029.

The auto industry’s landscape is shifting fast, and not just because of new models or tech. Donald Trump’s rollback of emissions standards and the elimination of federal EV tax credits have thrown a wrench into the works—especially for companies that bet big on electric vehicles. If you’re wondering who’s winning, who’s losing, and what it means for the cars you’ll see on the road, let’s break it down.

Why Are Ford, GM, and Stellantis Suddenly Saving Billions?

For years, automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis had to pay up—big time—if they didn’t meet federal fuel economy targets. The system worked like this: if a company sold too many gas-guzzlers, it had to buy regulatory credits from brands with cleaner fleets, like Tesla and Rivian. According to Bloomberg, GM alone shelled out $3.5 billion on credits since 2022. Ford and Stellantis? Also in the billions.

But with Trump’s rollback, the financial penalty for missing those targets is gone. That means Detroit’s Big Three can focus on their bread and butter—trucks and SUVs—without worrying about writing checks to their rivals. Ford CEO Jim Farley even called it a “multibillion-dollar opportunity,” and the company’s already retooling its Oakville plant to build Super Duty pickups instead of EVs. GM is scaling back EV production, and Stellantis is bringing back the Hemi V8. It’s like the clock just turned back a decade.

What’s the Fallout for Tesla, Rivian, and Smaller EV Startups?

Here’s where things get dicey. Tesla and Rivian didn’t just make money selling cars—they made a killing selling those regulatory credits. With that revenue stream drying up, Tesla could lose over $1 billion a year, according to industry estimates. For startups, the picture is even bleaker. Take Slate, for example. Their affordable electric truck was counting on the $7,500 federal tax credit to stay competitive. Now, with a sticker price near $30,000 and no tax break, their business model looks shaky at best.

It’s not just about lost profits. The end of tax credits makes EVs less attractive to buyers, especially in a market where price is king. Smaller brands that don’t have the deep pockets of Ford or GM may struggle to survive. We could see some names disappear before they ever really get started.

Is the EPA Abandoning Its Own Mission?

This is where the story takes a twist. The Environmental Protection Agency’s mission is crystal clear: protect human health and the environment. Yet, by supporting the rollback of emissions standards, the agency is doing the opposite. The EPA’s own website debunks myths about EVs—like the idea that they’re worse for the climate or will crash the power grid. In fact, J.D. Power and other analysts have shown that EVs are cheaper to own over the long haul when you factor in fuel and maintenance.

So why the about-face? Critics argue that the EPA is now prioritizing political directives over its stated mission. The result? Automakers are free to build more polluting vehicles, and consumers lose out on billions in potential savings. It’s a head-scratcher, especially when the science on emissions and public health is so clear.

What Does This Mean for Consumers and the Environment?

If you’re in the market for a new car, you’ll notice the difference. Expect more choices in trucks and SUVs, fewer affordable EVs, and less incentive to go electric. For the environment, the stakes are even higher. The rollback could lead to higher emissions, more fuel burned, and a slower transition to cleaner transportation.

But here’s the thing—change in the auto industry is never a straight line. Consumer demand, state-level policies, and global trends still matter. California and several other states are pushing ahead with stricter standards, and the global market for EVs is growing, especially in Europe and China. Automakers who ignore those trends do so at their own risk.

The big takeaway? Navigating the new rules of the road isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end. Whether you’re a car buyer, an industry insider, or just someone who cares about clean air, staying informed—and flexible—will put you in the driver’s seat.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trump-emissions-rollback-reshapes-auto-industry-winners-and-losers.avif,N,,2025-09-14 08:59:31.825683

According to Canary Media, leaders in the state's energy sector filed an urgent request Aug. 22 asking regulators to expedite approvals for new renewable projects. Just five days later, the utilities commission approved an accelerated timeline for permitting and construction, a rare move for state energy regulators.

The plan would finalize approvals by mid-2026 for 4 gigawatts of new wind and solar power, 200 megawatts of thermal power, and 300 megawatts of battery storage. Colorado already has 5 gigawatts of wind and 4.5 gigawatts of solar installed, meaning this expansion could significantly boost the state's capacity to deliver affordable, reliable clean energy before the Trump administration's new energy-constraining laws take effect.

The clear threat of higher energy prices caused by the administration's policies has created a rare alignment of interests among utility providers and ratepayer advocates to take advantage of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits right now.

Colorado's largest utility provider, Xcel Energy, stated that the accelerated plan could save customers $5 billion over the next two decades, providing critical relief as electricity demand rises faster than it has in decades. More clean power means less reliance on volatile coal and gas prices, helping protect residents from future price spikes.

Wind, solar, and storage projects can also significantly reduce planet-overheating pollution, lower air pollution from dirty energy plants, and make communities more resilient as demand for power surges from electric vehicles and costly data centers.

Colorado's push is being watched closely across the country. California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a similar executive order to help projects meet expiring federal deadlines.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis urged authorities to ""eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,"" adding that ""getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers; by maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they're available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the State can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.""

The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies.
This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.
The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.
""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement.","The Trump administration has unveiled a pilot program to accelerate the use of electric air taxis, a move aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in airspace technology.

The Department of Transportation on Friday said the Federal Aviation Administration's Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) will develop ""new frameworks and regulations for enabling safe operations"" and form partnerships with private sector companies as well as with state and local governments.

""The next great technological revolution in aviation is here,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement on Friday. ""The United States will lead the way, and doing so will cement America's status as a global leader in transportation innovation. That means more high-paying manufacturing jobs and economic opportunity.""

The program will include at least five pilot projects and will run for three years after the first project is up and running, the department said. The program will also include piloted and unmanned operations that focus on electric air taxis, also called an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft or eVTOL, that can help with delivering cargo and supplies. The aircraft will also be used to test their effectiveness in emergency situations, such as airlift and medical transport.

The program would allow the testing of aircraft both unmanned and piloted, and which may be capable of carrying passengers, before they complete FAA certification, a process that can take years. Aircraft must have FAA certification before carrying cargo or passengers when flying commercially, according to federal regulations.

This is not the first time the FAA has considered air taxis for future use.

In June 2023, the FAA greenlit a plan from Joby Aviation, a California-based aviation company, to begin test flights of an electric flying taxi prototype. The company on Friday announced plans to participate in the pilot program.

""We've spent more than 15 years building the aircraft technology and operational capabilities that are defining advanced aerial mobility, and we're ready to bring our services to communities,"" Joby's chief policy officer Greg Bowles said in a statement. ""We look forward to demonstrating our aircraft's maturity and delivering early operations in cities and states nationwide.""

Another company, Archer Aviation, also said Friday that it plans to participate in the program.

""We'll demonstrate that air taxis can operate safely and quietly,"" Archer founder and CEO Adam Goldstein said in a statement. ""These early flights will help cement American leadership in advanced aviation and set the stage for scaled commercial operations in the U.S. and beyond.""

The FAA said it is accepting proposals and a minimum of five participants will be selected, according to an unpublished federal notice about the program that is set to become public on Tuesday.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business.
Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?
While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.
Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.","With the federal government rolling back billions of dollars in incentives for renewable-energy development, experts have sounded the alarm over a widely overlooked yet highly likely impact: rising insurance costs.

What's happening?

In addition to ending significant tax incentives previously available to projects ranging in scale from home solar installations to massive wind farms, increased tariffs also have made it more expensive to purchase necessary materials, Canaan Crouch, the executive vice president and environmental broker at Jencap Specialty Insurance Services, told Insurance Business.

As a result, investors have significantly scaled back on renewable-energy development in the United States. According to BloombergNEF, in the first half of 2025, such investments dropped a staggering 36% from just a year prior, a loss of more than $20 billion in funding.

Crouch warned that the impact on consumers likely would be even greater and more immediate than on utility-scale projects.

""For consumers, any increase in supply costs or materials increases the overall cost of putting solar panels on your roof,"" Crouch told Insurance Business. ""So, consumers are probably seeing a bigger impact.""

On top of these direct effects, Crouch cautioned that these industry-wide changes also would have important secondary impacts, such as in the insurance market.

For example, when a homeowner decides to install solar panels on their roof, they must find an insurance carrier that is willing to cover the project's risks. The rising cost of even such small-scale projects has made insurers more hesitant to do so.

""Stay informed about what's happening with subsidies, tariffs, and inflationary pressures, because those are the factors that directly shape the risks we're insuring,"" cautioned Crouch, per Insurance Business.

With fewer carriers willing to insure such projects, prices for such coverage will inevitably increase, Crouch predicted.

While the market has yet to reflect such pressures, Crouch warned, ""If I had to read the tea leaves, there's going to be an increase in price.""

Why do rising insurance prices for renewable energy projects matter?

The impact that government policies have on insurance prices, and the ability to get insurance coverage at all, has been an overlooked yet significant aspect of the current administration's recent changes.

If individuals and companies are unable to insure renewable-energy projects, or if the cost of doing so rises significantly, fewer homeowners will be able to install solar panels, and fewer utility-scale renewable-energy projects will be built.

The result will not only hinder efforts to transition the U.S. economy toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy but likely will harm the nation's economy as a whole.

Even as renewable-energy investments in the U.S. cratered by more than one-third, such investments globally reached record highs, per BloombergNEF. This has put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage and puts the country at risk of falling behind in the energy revolution taking place throughout much of the world.

While U.S. renewable-energy investment dropped by $20 billion, the world saw overall investment grow by 10% to a record $386 billion, according to BloombergNEF.

Simply put, renewable-energy investors put off by recent changes in U.S. policy have found other countries to invest in.

As companies and countries around the globe continue to race for supremacy in artificial intelligence, powering the massive, energy-hungry data centers that make AI possible has become a key distinguishing factor. If the U.S. continues to fall behind on building the power sources of the future, it could significantly hurt the country's ability to compete in the AI race.

What's being done about it?

For the U.S. to once again shift course and regain its momentum in the transition toward cleaner, renewable sources of energy will require change at the political level.

To help make this happen, you can use your voice by contacting your elected representatives and letting them know where you stand on issues like renewable-energy tax incentives and tariffs on materials used in renewable-energy development. And, when election season rolls around, you also can make a difference by voting for candidates who share your views.

Taking things a step further, you can help by installing solar panels on your home now before Crouch's predicted insurance crunch becomes more severe.

EnergySage offers free online tools that make it easy to compare quotes from local solar installers and to take advantage of available incentives.

Gavin Newsom has championed as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks is in the hands of state lawmakers.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature is slated to vote Saturday on whether to extend the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013. It allows major greenhouse gas emitters to buy emission allowances from the state, with fewer available over time. Money from the sales fund climate change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution - all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature will vote on another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Cap and trade is an important cost-effective tool for curbing carbon emissions, said Katelyn Roedner Sutter, the California state director for the Environmental Defense Fund.

“Supporting this program and making this commitment into the future is extremely important - now more than ever,” she said.

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Council for Justice and Accountability.

Critics have also said it will increase the cost of living.

“This moving forward, instead of lowering costs, it makes California even more expensive,” Republican state Sen. Tony Strickland said. “They’re raising the price of energy and gas and goods and services.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It’s played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would streamline permits for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The state could refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement.","The Trump administration on Friday announced that it plans to stop requiring more than 8,000 polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would see industrial facilities like coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, and steel mills no longer have to track and report the amount of carbon dioxide, methane, and other emissions they emit—a requirement that had been in place since 2010.

The agency said that U.S. businesses could save as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over the next decade as a result of the change. Some experts have argued that the societal costs of emissions from companies in the U.S. could run into the tens of trillions by 2050.

The EPA in its release said that requiring facilities to report emissions had “no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” It comes after months of work by the Trump administration to dismantle various federal programs designed to combat climate change and cuts to research funding to study the phenomenon.

The administration’s efforts to pull back on climate change is at odds with the broad scientific consensus that human-driven warming is linked to extreme weather and health risks. A study published in Nature this past week, for example, showed that 180 of the world’s biggest fossil fuel and cement producers made 213 extreme heatwaves between 2000 and 2023 more likely and more dangerous.

What does greenhouse gas reporting do?

Since 2010, the greenhouse gas reporting program has collected emissions data from about 8,000 of the largest industrial facilities in the U.S. from 47 different source categories. In turn, this information has historically been shared with the United Nations, but for the first time in nearly 30 years, the Trump administration missed an April deadline to submit data on U.S. climate emissions.

As part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required industrialized countries to reduce their emissions to combat climate change. U.S. President Donald Trump announced on his first day in office that the U.S. would withdraw from this agreement for the second time (Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term).

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator, said in a statement. “Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

“Unlike other mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment. By reducing the overall regulatory burden, current regulated parties will be able to focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits,” an EPA spokesperson told Fast Company in a statement.

Certain oil and gas facilities will still be required to report emissions data as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, although the EPA’s proposal would allow these facilities to suspend reporting until 2034.

Critics point to cost of losing data

Environmental advocates criticized the proposal as hampering future policy making.

“With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policymaking,” a former EPA official under the Biden administration told The New York TImes.

The proposal would eliminate data that the public, states, and local policymakers have depended on for more than 15 years, leaving Americans “in the dark” about where pollution is coming from, David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, told The Associated Press.

Before this proposal is finalized, the EPA will hold a virtual public hearing and accept public comments for 47 days after the proposal is published in the Federal Register.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/09/p-91404426-EPA-to-stop-recording-emissions.jpg",N,,2025-09-13 20:01:20.590584

His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.
Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines.","Gov. Gavin Newsom closed out the legislative year with one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades — a package that could give him a presidential debate-stage talking point on rising energy costs as the Democratic Party shifts its focus to affordability.

The six-bill deal — passed Saturday after lawmakers extended their session by an extra day because of last-minute dealmaking — was sold as a way to ease gas prices and soaring electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs.

Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills. They also will get some protection from utilities hiking rates based on the cost of wildfire-proofing their infrastructure, such as by putting power lines underground. But they’ll also continue paying $9 billion over the next decade into a fund to compensate wildfire victims.

The package of legislation now heads to the governor’s desk for his signature.

Newsom and his allies, who negotiated the package in the final days of the legislative session, said the state needed to allow more permits to drill oil to head off more refinery shutdowns that could send gas prices soaring.

Critics said the biggest winners of the maneuvering were the oil industry and the state’s major utilities. Oil drilling measures advanced in Kern County after refiners threatened to shutter plants. Utilities gained sweeping new wildfire liability protections and the ability to join a regional power market — a step critics warned could tether California to fossil-fuel states at a time when the Trump administration is moving to roll back clean energy.

Michael Wara, a Stanford legal scholar focused on energy policy, called it “astonishing” that lawmakers managed to pass so many major bills at once, including the two-thirds vote to reauthorize cap-and-trade. California is making steady progress in shifting from fossil fuels to renewables, even as wildfires complicate the transition, and while the measures were imperfect, they were necessary, he said.

“I’ve been a part, over the last decade, of getting individual tweaks done in each of these areas — but the idea that we would get them all done at once, on time, when we needed to, is astonishing to me,” Wara said. “Are the bills perfect? No, from my perspective they’re not perfect, but they are all material improvements over the status quo.”

The future of cap and trade reinforced

At the center of the bargain was the extension of California’s cap-and-trade system — rebranded by Newsom as “cap and invest” — through 2045. The extension, hammered out in backroom talks, was one of the most divisive elements of the package.

The carbon-trading program, launched in 2013, is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The program sets a strict cap on emissions for polluters and hands out a limited supply of permits companies can sell to other polluters if they cut enough emissions.

The final agreement on the program preserved rules that let oil companies avoid paying the full cost of their emissions while leaving untouched a cap on carbon prices. That setup shields polluters while leaving consumers potentially exposed to higher gas prices, experts said.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas stood by the energy package on Saturday, arguing the measure to boost in-state oil production and keep refineries from closing would keep prices down at the pump. “Altogether,” he told reporters, the deal “is going to result in some billions of dollars in savings.”

The California Chamber of Commerce was out front in opposing the cap and trade deal, arguing it would make energy less affordable by taking credits away from gas customers and giving them to electric utilities — hurting families, renters, and small businesses that still depend on natural gas. The powerful business group has poured at least $6.9 million into legislative races over the past decade, according to CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database.

The oil industry’s chief lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Association, which had pushed back early on, eventually settled into neutrality. Meanwhile, environmental justice advocates remained staunchly against it, saying the program protects oil and gas companies while leaving nearby low-income communities to bear the health costs of pollution.

A group of seven environmental justice groups from across the state, including Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Asian Pacific Environmental Network Action, said the extension “institutionalizes inequality in California’s climate policy.”

“This year, California’s leaders gutted basic public health and safety protections and took away tools communities need to protect themselves from polluters,” the groups said.

Alongside reauthorization of the program, a companion bill provided a blueprint for how the state should spend its revenues, reshaping it starting in 2026 to guarantee $1 billion a year for high-speed rail and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to direct through the budget.

Questioning the affordability premise

The sweeping climate and energy package was born of mounting pressures — some long expected, others abrupt. Affordability has become the defining fault line in Democratic politics since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, powered by a campaign fixated on cutting costs and fighting inflation.

At the same time, Democrats are leaning into the rhetoric of “abundance,” a term popularized by columnist Ezra Klein to capture the idea that more housing, clean energy and infrastructure can ease scarcity and lower costs. But some consumer advocates and Capitol insiders argue the measures won’t ultimately help consumers.

“I don’t know how any of this saves money,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “But this is the new state of Sacramento. I think it happened because of Trump, honestly, I think this is all about abundance and Trump, and Democrats trying to make a name for themselves by dumping regulation.”

Republicans, too, slammed the package, but they called it over-regulation that would continue to keep gas and energy costs high. Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Murrieta Republican, called Democrats’ goals of using the cap-and-trade dollars to improve transit “unrealistic” when Californians “are not going to give up driving their cars,” and said the party’s stated three goals can’t coexist.

“Climate, energy and affordability are like oil, water and sand,” he said. “People aren’t going to be able to live here.”

Newsom’s push to keep gasoline prices and energy bills in check — a message potentially aimed as much at a national audience in a future presidential bid as at Californians — meshed with Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas’s early pledge to make 2025 the Legislature’s “year of affordability.”

Meanwhile, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and his team resisted giving ground to oil and gas interests without securing gains for environmental and social justice priorities, given the concentration of polluting industries and poor air quality in low-income communities.

Cap-and-trade renewal took on urgency as carbon auctions faltered and Trump singled out the program — originally set to expire in 2030 — as potentially unconstitutional.

A ‘giveaway to big oil’?

At the same time, refinery closures and oil company threats to leave California put Newsom in a bind. After blasting the industry as deceitful and politically manipulative for years, Newsom reversed course. His administration unveiled concessions to keep production in the state and the California Energy Commission suspended a controversial profit cap on gasoline refiners for the next five years.

While much of the governor’s original oil refinery proposal was pared back in the Legislature, drilling approvals advanced in Kern County. That was a victory for Republican Sen. Shannon Grove, who represents the county. Grove has spent a decade pushing to keep drilling and its middle-class jobs alive there.

The approved oil permits, she said, “will result in California-compliant oil that is the most regulated in the world.”

Nevertheless, Assemblymember Alex Lee, a Democrat from Milpitas, criticized the oil deal from the Assembly floor Saturday as a “giveaway to big oil.”

“The thing we need to focus on is a controlled and managed phaseout of fossil fuel, like the dinosaurs that they process, the petroleum-oil, fossil-fuel industry fuel is dying out,” Lee said. “Refineries and facilities are closing, not just in California, but in Texas and across the world.”

Lawmakers also established a state fund to monitor pollution mitigation in disadvantaged communities.

Layered onto those debates was a high-stakes battle over utility finances. Wildfire liabilities loomed over investor-owned utilities, especially Southern California Edison, now under scrutiny for its potential role in the Eaton Fire in Altadena. Newsom pressed to expand California’s $18 billion wildfire fund — a safeguard supporters said was vital to protect ratepayers if utilities sparked future blazes, but one that critics warned could ultimately drive consumer bills higher.

Meanwhile lawmakers took a major push to let California join a shared Western electricity market, allowing power to flow more easily across state lines. Supporters say it could cut costs for customers and steady the grid during crunch times like heat waves, while supporting in-state clean power producers who could sell excess electricity to neighbors.

Consumer advocates, led by The Utility Reform Network, warned the change could weaken California’s control over its clean energy agenda and hand more power to a federal government under Trump that is siding with fossil fuels. Some environmental and consumer groups shared that concern.

The shift is important because California has spent decades building one of the cleanest grids in the world and the move to open up that system to other Western states could reshape how both renewable and fossil power move across the region.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again.
In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient.
Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms.
Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels.","The Danish wind giant Ørsted is fighting for its survival after United States President Donald Trump introduced a barrage of orders limiting the growth of the wind power sector. After declaring an energy emergency in the U.S. upon entering office in January, Trump has spent the past eight months introducing executive orders and legislation to strengthen fossil fuel production and limit the expansion of the renewable energy sector. This has led to greater investor uncertainty and has caused project delays and financial harm to green energy producers.

In January, Trump ordered a review of offshore wind permitting and leasing, and in the months since he has introduced a host of orders and laws aimed at curbing wind energy development, which have led to the halt of several major projects, In August, Europe’s largest wind power company, Ørsted, released a statement blaming President Trump for derailing its business model after its market value dropped by nearly a third. It is now fighting to get its business on track.

Ørsted received approval from shareholders for its $9.4 billion rights issue in early September. The company was forced to raise new capital after its profits fell in recent months due to project delays and investor uncertainty, among other factors. The Trump administration halted work on Ørsted’s 704-MW Revolution Windfarm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut in August, despite the company holding project permits and works being around 80 percent complete.

This led Ørsted to sue the Trump administration in September, in a bid to get the project moving again. Orsted requested that the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismiss the stop-work order, saying it was arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and “issued in bad faith”. Orsted and its partner Skyborn Renewables have already invested $5 billion in Revolution Wind, a project which is expected to provide power for over 350,000 homes in the region.

Norway’s wind giant Equinor was one of the companies to support Ørsted’s search for capital, offering $1 billion in funding to help keep it afloat. In a bid of confidence, Equinor said it planned to retain its 10 percent ownership of Ørsted, which it completed last December, making it the second-largest shareholder after the Danish government. The Norwegian firm said it was confident in Ørsted’s underlying business and the competitiveness of offshore wind in the future energy mix. As part of the move, Equinor plans to nominate a candidate to Ørsted’s board of directors.

Ørsted’s shares have fallen in recent months in the face of various challenges, mainly centred around U.S. policy decisions. The firm’s share prices have decreased by around 90 percent from the 2021 peak. The support from Equinor has made some in the industry question whether the two companies could be heading towards a merger.

It is not just Ørsted that has been hit hard by Trump’s attack on the renewable energy sector. President Trump has long hailed the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the most far-reaching climate policy to date, a “Green New Scam. Greatest scam in history, probably.” His blatant attack on green energy from the moment he entered office, and even before, on his campaign trail, has led to greater investor uncertainty in the sector. Many renewable energy producers and cleantech companies now fear cuts in funding and project delays, after several years of high investment and the rapid acceleration of green energy deployment.

In September, the Trump administration instructed around half a dozen government agencies to draft plans to restrict U.S. wind energy development, as Trump labelled wind farms as ugly, expensive, and inefficient. Agencies that have traditionally had little to do with wind energy have been called upon to support efforts to restrict the development of offshore wind farms. At the Health and Human Services Department, officials are now assessing whether wind turbines are emitting electromagnetic fields harmful to human health, while the Department of Defence (War) is probing whether wind projects could pose a threat to national security.

Following the instruction, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. said he was working with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth as part of a “departmental coalition team” to assess the risks from offshore wind farms. “We’re all working together on this issue,” Kennedy said during a cabinet meeting.

Several agencies are expected to assess their existing policies to see if there are any that are favourable for wind energy development that could be redirected to other forms of energy, particularly fossil fuels. The move will build on previous actions by the Trump administration to curb U.S. wind energy development in favour of oil, gas, and coal, as President Trump looks to largely undo the groundwork laid by the Biden administration for a green transition.

(AP) — California will extend a key climate program under a bill state lawmakers passed Saturday, sending the measure to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has championed it as a crucial tool to respond to the Trump administration’s environmental rollbacks.

The Democrat-dominated Legislature voted to reauthorize the state’s cap-and-trade program, which is set to expire after 2030. Then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed a law authorizing the program in 2006, and it launched in 2013.

The program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.

Newsom, a Democrat, and legislative leaders, who said months ago they would prioritize reauthorizing the program, almost ran out of time to introduce the proposal before the statehouse wraps for the year.

“After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California’s transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,” Newsom said after striking the deal this week.

The proposal would reauthorize the program through 2045, better align the declining cap on emissions with the state’s climate targets and potentially boost carbon-removal projects. It would also change the name to “cap and invest” to emphasize its funding of climate programs.

The Legislature approved another bill committing annual funding from the program’s revenues. It includes $1 billion for the state’s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.

Officials try to balance environmental protection with cost of living

The votes come as officials contend with balancing the state’s ambitious climate goals and the cost of living. California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state’s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.

Proponents of the extension say it will give companies certainty over the program’s future. The state lost out on $3.6 billion in revenues over the past year and a half, largely due to uncertainty, according to a report from Clean and Prosperous California, a group of economists and lawyers supporting the program. Some environmentalists say the Trump administration’s attacks on climate programs, including the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, added urgency to the reauthorization effort.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the extension balanced the state’s ambitious emission-reduction and affordability goals. The Democrat called cap and trade “the cornerstone of our climate strategy.”

But environmental justice advocates opposing the proposal say it doesn’t go far enough and lacks strong air quality protections for low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters.

“This really continues to allow big oil to reduce their emissions on paper instead of in real life,” said Asha Sharma, state policy manager at the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability.

GOP lawmakers say cap-and-trade will raise prices in California

GOP lawmakers criticized the program, saying it would make living in California more expensive.

“Cap and trade has become cap and tax,” said James Gallagher, the Assembly Republican minority leader. “It’s going to raise everybody’s costs.”

Cap and trade has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played “a very small role” in increasing electricity prices because the state’s grid isn’t very carbon intensive, the report says.

Lawmakers and lobbyists criticized the governor and legislative leaders for rushing the deal through with little public input.

Ben Golombek, executive vice president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said at a hearing this week that the Legislature should have taken more time “to do this right.”

Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar said it shouldn’t be par for the course for lawmakers to jam through bills without the opportunity for amendments.

“We’re expected to vote on it,” she said of Democrats. “If not, you’re seen to not be part of the team or not want to be a team player.”

Menjivar ultimately voted to advance the bill out of committee.

Energy affordability and fuel supply

The cap-and-trade bills are part of a sweeping package lawmakers approved aimed at advancing the state’s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians.

One of the bills would speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, which proponents have hailed as a necessary response to planned refinery closures and critics have blasted as a threat to air quality.

Another bill would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.

The Legislature voted to refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze. The bill would set up public financing to build electric utility projects.

Lawmakers also passed a measure allowing the state’s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states. The bill aims to improve grid reliability. It would save ratepayers money because California would sell power to other states when it generates more than it needs and buy cheaper energy from out of state when necessary, the governor’s office said.",https://www.kxan.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/40/2025/09/68c5f1c4d41f06.27666104.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-13 19:00:44.176473

The development of a next-generation thermal fluid, called Shell EV-Plus, promises to recharge batteries from 10% to 80% in less than 10 minutes without compromising safety or cell life.

Shell fluid accelerates electric car charging

The breakthrough was made possible by a joint venture between Shell Lubricants and RML Group, a British company specializing in automotive innovation. Together they designed a 34-kWh battery pack that incorporates this thermal fluid based on gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology. (GTL) TECHNOLOGY. This combination allows higher charging currents to be tolerated with precise thermal control.

Under optimal conditions, a light, aerodynamic vehicle consuming 10 km/kWh could recover up to 24 km of range for every minute connected to the charger. This figure far exceeds the 5 km per minute typical of many current models, representing a significant improvement in range per charge time.

The key to performance lies in the ability of the Shell EV-Plus fluid to fill all spaces within the battery pack, maximizing contact with each cell and ensuring efficient heat transfer. Its non-conductive nature allows it to maintain electrical electrical safety while managing the heat generated during fast charging.

Safety and more compact design

In addition to shortening charging times, this breakthrough makes it possible to design more compact battery packs with fewer components and greater thermal stability. This translates into propulse and safer battery packs, suitable for the next generation of electric vehicles.

Shell will showcase this innovation in October during The Battery Show North America in Detroit, one of the most relevant events in the industry. The initiative reinforces Shell’s commitment to the electrification of transportation and the development of solutions that drive the mass adoption of electric vehicles worldwide.

And several new projects in Europe have started the process of eliminating our reliance on oil and gas. The fact that it is right beneath the sea only makes this new development more exciting. TotalEnergies and Air Liquide plan to develop two projects that will deliver about 45,000 t/year of green hydrogen for our ever-growing energy needs. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and only requires some special attention to become the fuel of the future.

The Netherlands has become the home of renewable energy production

That can only become a reality when the system comes online, and like Skynet in the Terminator, it could change the world forever, only this time in a positive way. TotalEnergies has signed agreements with Air Liquide to develop two projects that could aim to tap into the natural reserves of hydrogen sitting in the sea just waiting for us to find them.

The power will be generated mostly by the OranjeWind offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea, and plans to transport the green hydrogen via a pipeline inland towards the Hydrogen Network Rotterdam grid. It forms part of the new trajectory that the Netherlands is heading towards in sustainable energy solutions that meet and exceed the world’s energy needs.

The joint venture plans to construct and operate a 250-MW electrolyzer near the Zeeland refinery in the southern Netherlands, which could be commissioned in 2029, and reduce the site’s CO2 emissions by up to 300,000 t/year. Those are some impressive numbers that will surely drive the world’s big oil companies absolutely insane.

The world is pivoting towards hydrogen as the fuel of the future

Our reliance on fossil fuels needs to end; we are all acutely aware of that truth. Uncomfortable as it may be, the truth hardly spares a moment to consider how we might feel. But the new joint venture is a step towards a sustainable future that all of us, and our descendants, can enjoy and be an active part of. The project has been given the green light and has the world eagerly awaiting the first phase.

To make the deal even sweeter, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW to be dedicated to producing 15,000 t/year of green hydrogen for the TotalEnergies platform in Antwerp. So the project is aiming to enter the rest of Europe as well. How will the Europeans react to a whole new mode of energy production that comes from the sea?

While the Netherlands is a small country, they have significant interests in renewable and sustainable energy production, and no matter who you ask, hydrogen is the most viable fuel source for the world’s needs. We just need a practical method of extraction and storage, and then we are off to the races, as they say. It’s a promising sign to see some of the world’s largest energy companies making significant investments in sustainable energy.

The elimination of federal tax credits for electric vehicles is a major move on its own. Paired with the removal of penalties for missing fuel economy targets under CAFE regulations, the result is a playing field with entirely new rules.

The immediate winners are the combustion-heavy brands that can now focus on selling trucks and SUVs without financial punishment. On the other side, Tesla, Rivian, and other EV specialists stand to lose billions, not because demand for their cars will collapse, but because a critical source of revenue has been pulled out from under them. At the center of the storm is an Environmental Protection Agency that appears to be working against the mission printed on its own website.

Cash Flow Reversal

Since 2022, GM has spent some $3.5 billion buying regulatory credits, says Bloomberg. Ford and Stellantis have spent billions as well. That cash went to brands like Tesla and Rivian, which had plenty of credits to sell since their cars emit zero emissions. With the end of EV tax credits and CAFE fines for breaking regulations, Ford, GM and Stellantis can pour the money they would’ve spent on credits back into their own piggy bank.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said the policy shift has the “potential to unlock a multibillion-dollar opportunity,” noting that the Blue Oval is already retooling its Oakville, Ontario, plant to build Super Duty pickups instead of EVs.

GM is also cutting back on EV production, opting to overhaul factories for gasoline-fueled models. Stellantis, meanwhile, has gone so far as to revive the thirsty Hemi V8 engine, something previously thought dead in the age of electrification. With all of these changes, death might now be coming for some EV brands.

Trouble Ahead For EV Startups

Not only does the end of tax credits make purchasing an EV less palatable for many, but it also means that brands which used to benefit from selling tax credits now need to readjust to the new reality. Smaller brands, though, might be in big trouble. For example, Slate’s trucklet looks almost pointless with a starting price near $30,000 as the EV tax credit was vital to its success.

Even larger brands like Tesla and Rivian have leaned on the pure profit they’ve gained by selling regulatory credits. That money likely won’t be coming back anytime soon and that’s because the EPA seems willing to do just about anything the Trump Administration deems reasonable.

A Mission Ignored

It states plainly that its mission is “to protect human health and the environment.” Love them or hate them, electric vehicles are probably better at that than combustion cars. In fact, the EPA itself has an entire page dedicated to debunking the myths so many like to perpetuate surrounding them.

Things like “EVs are worse for the climate than gas cars,” “EVs are unreliable,” and “EVs will collapse the power grid.” Furthermore, J.D. Power is one of many sources that indicate that when all costs are considered, EVs are cheaper to buy, maintain, and own long-term when compared to combustion cars.

No one argues that people should be forced into one type of car. Choice matters. The government shouldn’t force anyone into a specific car or truck. But supporting policies that improve human health and the environment is what the EPA literally says it’s supposed to do.

By supporting Trump’s rollback of strict fuel economy standards and regulations, the agency is doing the exact opposite of its own mission statement. It’s clearing the way for automakers to build more polluting vehicles, burn more fuel, and erase billions in total consumer savings. If the EPA won’t uphold its own mission, it seems that nobody will.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs - likely for the biggest power users - to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast - twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data - and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/Big_Tech-Electricity_Cutoffs_30745_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582,N,,2025-09-13 18:00:39.404137

Today's sweeping actions will also make energy more affordable for ratepayers at a time when people are struggling to cope with rising costs of living.

“Lowering energy prices for the long haul requires forward-thinking investments in the electricity grid to benefit all Californians. Improving coordination across western energy markets will create a cleaner, more efficient and more reliable grid for decades to come. This will enable California to export more of its excess solar energy to neighboring states while cutting electricity prices at home.

“The reauthorization and restructuring of Cap-and-Invest's climate credits will lower electricity rates for all Californians and incentivize broader electrification, representing an important new chapter for the program.

“Expanding long range, high voltage transmission is essential to bringing additional clean energy projects online and retiring costly, outdated fossil fuel plants. To date, California has struggled to complete these critical projects on time. Public financing of transmission will support acceleration of these projects at a lower cost, leading to increased savings and improved electricity reliability for California ratepayers. Looking ahead, creating even more public financing mechanisms for electricity grid infrastructure could further add to these benefits.”

For those seeking to optimize their financial strategy, understanding the interplay between timing, eligibility, and broader economic trends is critical.

The Clock is Ticking

The IRS has not yet published granular details on the 2025 EV credit application process, but the general tax filing deadline remains fixed. According to the IRS's official guidance, individuals must use their online accounts to track eligibility and submission requirementsOnline account for individuals | Internal Revenue Service[ 2 ]. This lack of specificity underscores the importance of acting swiftly. Delays in purchasing or filing could result in missed opportunities, particularly as the labor market evolves under AI-driven disruptions and green transition initiatives[ 3 ].

Strategic Purchase Timelines

While exact credit amounts and eligibility criteria for 2025 remain unclear, historical data from the IRA's implementation in 2023 suggests that credits are contingent on factors such as vehicle price, battery sourcing, and domestic assemblyInflation: Why is it rising across the world and will it stay that way[ 4 ]. Investors should prioritize purchasing qualifying EVs before the end of 2025 to ensure they meet the April 15, 2025, filing deadline. Those who delay risk overlapping with 2026's tax cycle, which may feature revised credit parameters due to inflationary pressures or policy adjustmentsIn charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum[ 5 ].

Broader Economic Considerations

Global inflationary trends, as highlighted by the World Economic Forum, complicate tax planning. Rising prices erode the real value of tax credits over time, making early claiming a prudent strategy. For instance, a $7,500 credit in 2025 may carry less purchasing power in 2026 if inflation persists. Additionally, skill inflation—where demand for specialized labor outpaces supply—could drive up costs for EV-related services, further incentivizing early action.

A Call for Proactive Planning

Businesses and individuals must treat EV tax credits as a dynamic asset rather than a static benefit. This means:

1. Monitoring IRS updates via online accounts to stay ahead of procedural changesOnline account for individuals | Internal Revenue Service[ 2 ].

2. Aligning purchases with projected income levels to maximize credit utilization.

3. Factoring in macroeconomic risks, such as interest rate fluctuations, which could affect borrowing costs for EV financing.

Conclusion

The April 15, 2025, deadline is not merely a regulatory marker but a strategic

for EV investors. By combining timely purchases with an awareness of macroeconomic shifts, stakeholders can secure tax advantages while navigating the uncertainties of a post-pandemic, AI-driven economy.

Under SB 787, state agencies, labor unions, environmental organizations, and clean energy industries will coordinate supply chain development for three key sectors: batteries, offshore wind, and building-decarbonization technologies.

“The Trump administration is denying climate change and torpedoing clean energy projects nationwide. California can step up and continue to grow its global leadership in the fight against climate change,” said Sen. McNerney, D-Pleasanton. “SB 787 will help California meet our clean energy goals while also creating family-supporting manufacturing jobs, accelerating the deployment of affordable clean energy, and advancing economic development goals across every region of the state.”

The state Senate early today approved SB 787 on a 29-8 vote, after the state Assembly voted 53-9 in favor of the bill on Friday evening. SB 787 now goes to the governor’s desk for consideration. If signed into law, SB 787 would take effect March 1, 2027. The legislation is sponsored by the United Auto Workers (UAW).

“UAW is committed to an equitable vision for decarbonizing California’s economy. Part of that vision is growing good union manufacturing jobs in the industries of the future, while accelerating clean energy deployment and bringing down the price of energy for working class Californians,” said Mike Miller, director of UAW Region 6, which represents 100,000 members across various industries in California. “With SB 787, we’ve sponsored a bill championed by Senator McNerney that will go a long way towards reaching these critical goals in an affordable manner. We’re proud to be joined by a broad coalition of unions, environmentalists, businesses, community groups, counties, utilities, and other organizations who have linked arms in supporting this commonsense measure.”

California has established ambitious goals for building a green economy that accelerates the deployment of affordable clean energy and provides quality jobs. However, the state lacks a comprehensive approach to building the clean energy supply chains and workforce needed to achieve its goals.

If combined with strong planning and implementation policies, these clean energy goals could also support strong economic growth and quality jobs across the state. According to the CEC’s SB 525 Offshore Wind Strategic Plan, California has the potential to reach 11,280 supply chain jobs by 2045 for offshore wind alone. The state’s GDP could grow upwards of $5 billion.

SB 787 formalizes partnerships between state agencies, labor, environmental organizations, and clean energy industries to coordinate supply chain development for of batteries, including electric vehicle and grid-scale batteries, along with building decarbonization technologies and offshore wind.

Conclusion The U.S. climate policy landscape remains a mosaic of federal incentives, state-level innovation, and international uncertainty.","The U.S. climate policy landscape in 2025 is defined by a dual trajectory: aggressive domestic decarbonization efforts and an ambiguous stance on international climate diplomacy, particularly as the COP30 summit in Belém, Brazil, approaches. While federal and state-level initiatives have accelerated clean energy adoption, the absence of explicit U.S. policy statements on COP30 participation or the ""honest dialogue"" framework—implied to address gaps in climate action—has created uncertainty for investors. This analysis explores how evolving policy dynamics could reshape subsidies, renewable infrastructure, and ESG-aligned equities, while identifying sectors poised for disruption or growth.

The Domestic Climate Momentum: A Foundation for Growth

The Biden administration's climate agenda, bolstered by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, has injected over $369 billion into clean energy projects, including tax credits for solar, wind, and electric vehicles (EVs) 2023 Annual Report | All Hands on Deck - U.S. Climate Alliance, [https://usclimatealliance.org/report/2023-annual-report/][ 1 ]. According to a 2024 Rand Corporation report, these incentives have catalyzed private-sector investments, with the U.S. Climate Alliance—encompassing 25 states—projected to meet its 2025 emissions reduction target of 26% below 2005 levels U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ]. This momentum has directly fueled demand for renewable infrastructure, with solar and wind capacity expected to grow by 12% and 8%, respectively, in 2025 U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

However, the uneven pace of state-level action remains a risk. While California and Iowa have emerged as leaders in clean energy adoption, states like Texas continue to prioritize fossil fuels, creating a fragmented market. For investors, this disparity highlights the need to scrutinize regional policy risks and opportunities, particularly in grid modernization and storage technologies.

COP30 and the ""Honest Dialogue"": Implications for Global and Domestic Markets

Though no direct U.S. policy statements on COP30 strategy changes have been identified, the conference's focus on the ""Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T""—aiming to scale international climate finance to $1.3 trillion annually by 2035—could indirectly influence domestic subsidies. If the U.S. shifts toward a more critical ""honest dialogue"" on climate finance, as suggested by COP30's emphasis on transparency and accountability, it may reevaluate its contributions to global funds or demand stricter reporting from recipients. Such a pivot could redirect federal funding toward domestic projects, particularly in disadvantaged communities, amplifying the IRA's existing equity-focused provisions U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

The logistical challenges facing COP30—such as Brazil's accommodation crisis and infrastructure controversies—also underscore the risks of delayed global climate finance. For U.S. investors, this could mean heightened volatility in ESG-aligned equities, particularly in firms reliant on international partnerships or carbon credit markets.

Sector-Specific Opportunities and Risks

Renewable Infrastructure and EVs: The IRA's tax credits and state-level cap-and-invest programs are likely to sustain growth in solar, wind, and EV manufacturing. However, supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures remain near-term headwinds.

Energy Storage and Grid Modernization: With the U.S. Climate Alliance targeting 100% clean electricity by 2035, investments in battery storage and smart grid technologies are critical. Federal grants under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will play a pivotal role in scaling these solutions U.S. Climate Policy Explained: What Americans Need to …, [https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/09/us-climate-policy-explained-what-americans-need-to.html][ 2 ].

ESG-Linked Equities: A potential ""honest dialogue"" on climate action could lead to stricter ESG reporting standards, pressuring underperforming firms while rewarding those with verifiable decarbonization strategies. Sectors like green hydrogen and carbon capture may see renewed interest if policy clarity emerges post-COP30.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Diversify Exposure: Prioritize companies with diversified revenue streams across domestic and international markets to mitigate risks from shifting climate finance priorities.

Monitor Policy Signals: Track state-level climate initiatives, as they often serve as precursors to federal action. For example, California's Advanced Clean Trucks rule has already influenced national EV adoption trends.

Engage in ESG Due Diligence: As COP30 emphasizes accountability, firms with transparent emissions data and robust sustainability frameworks will likely outperform peers.

Conclusion

The U.S. climate policy landscape remains a mosaic of federal incentives, state-level innovation, and international uncertainty. While the absence of direct statements on COP30 strategy complicates near-term forecasts, the underlying momentum in clean energy suggests that long-term investment opportunities outweigh risks. Investors who align with the IRA's market-driven incentives and prepare for potential shifts in global climate finance will be well-positioned to navigate this evolving terrain.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd24f7700bc002.png,N,,2025-09-13 15:59:36.846040

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

""Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency's statutory obligations,'' he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environment_AP_25255740590738_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 21:59:25.420098

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

""Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency's statutory obligations,'' he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/environment_AP_25255740590738_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 18:00:29.206785

The new solar facilities, consisting of a total of 1,068 megawatts (MW), will be built and maintained by third-party companies that successfully bid projects in the CARES 2023 Request for Proposal (RFP), which was approved in the 2022 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) Final Order.

The CARES program allows eligible commercial and industrial customers to support their sustainability initiatives by purchasing a subscription for a pro-rata share of the production of renewable resources. Demand for such subscriptions continues to grow from customers with sustainability goals.

“Renewable RFPs, such as the CARES 2023 RFP, are designed to procure valuable renewable energy that helps to diversify Georgia Power’s generation mix and increase reliability. Our planning models project that these resources will deliver benefits to customers long-term,” said Wilson Mallard, director of renewable development for Georgia Power. “The five projects we selected are economical and we expect they will provide energy and capacity benefits to the system and the most value for all Georgia Power customers.”

Expanding Renewable Energy Within a Diverse Generation Mix

Georgia Power is seeking additional renewable resources to continue to build a reliable, diversified generation portfolio through competitive RFP processes, which help maintain flexibility amid changing market conditions and enable the company to continue to provide more carbon-free energy to customers.

The CARES 2025 RFP, also approved in the 2022 IRP Final Order, was recently issued with bids due in August. CARES 2025 RFP bidders were asked to submit utility-scale solar or solar plus storage bids to meet a target of up to 2,000 MW of utility-scale solar including any remaining unfilled utility-scale resources from the CARES 2023 RFP program. These utility-scale solar projects are expected to have commercial operation dates as early as 2028.

Georgia Power’s 2025 IRP, approved in July, highlights the additional procurement of a total of up to 4,000 MW of renewable resources by 2035, with an initial target of 1,100 MW of new renewable resources sought through competitive utility-scale and distributed generation procurements. The company anticipates issuing RFPs in 2026 for these new resources, which would expand the company’s renewable resource portfolio to approximately 11,000 MW by 2035.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/sports/georgia-power-cares-solar-panels.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-09-13 15:00:00.693981

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs - likely for the biggest power users - to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast - twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data - and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/13/Big_Tech-Electricity_Cutoffs_30745_c0-167-4000-2500_s1200x700.jpg?309b4467e1f3a2a8ff765db9a91ebeb327dbd582,N,,2025-09-13 19:01:05.250478

Final Thoughts Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise to revolutionize the way we power electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and renewable energy systems.","The most solid alternative to widely used lithium-ion batteries, with the benefits of improved safety, higher energy density, longer lifespan, and faster charging, is almost here.

This promising alternative is solid-state batteries (SSBs), which replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes, thereby eliminating the fire risk and allowing for more compact designs, as well as supporting more charge cycles before degradation.

A recent study1 from the University of California reviewed the technology and found it capable of transforming not just electric cars but also consumer electronics and energy storage. The key to it all is chemistry and engineering.

“By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires.”

– Lead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR

Unlike the liquid in traditional lithium-ion batteries, which degrade over time, pose fire risk, and limit charging speed, the solid material used in solid-state batteries offers a more stable and safer environment, enabling more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.

With its superior qualities compared to current lithium-ion batteries, SSBs have been gaining a lot of traction among companies, but so far, the technology remains in the development stage. Not for long now, though.

Real-World Validation: Solid-State Batteries in EVs (QS/VW Demo)

This week, solid-state battery developer QuantumScape (QS +12.43%), along with its business partner PowerCo, made a live demonstration of its energy-dense solid-state lithium-metal batteries powering a vehicle.

PowerCo is the battery business of the Volkswagen Group, one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. VW is the owner of brands like Audi, Bentley, CUPRA, Ducati, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, and Škoda. The company also produces light commercial vehicles and heavy commercial vehicles like MAN and Scania, while CARIAD is the software and technology unit for all Volkswagen Group vehicles.

VW Group and PowerCo have been long-term investors in QuantumScape’s solid-state technology and have been testing their prototype cells for years.

Now, for the first time, QuantumScape, PowerCo, and Volkswagen Group have showcased the new tech at IAA Mobility in Munich, one of the world’s largest mobility trade fairs.

Pulling the black sheet off the vehicle, they revealed a modified, fully electric Ducati V21L race motorcycle, which is wholly powered by QSE-5 solid-state cells.

The solid-state cells in the motorcycle were assembled using QuantumScape’s proprietary manufacturing platform (Cobra production process), which allows for faster heat treatment, requires less floor space, and eliminates certain material steps. The first-of-its-kind battery system, meanwhile, is designed by specialists at Audi, specifically for QS SSB cells.

The demonstration marks a big achievement not just for the companies involved but also the electric vehicle (EV) sector, as it was the first time that QuantumScape’s anode-free cells moved from the manufacturing plant into an actual vehicle for the world to see.

“Today we’ve crossed the threshold from possibility to reality.”

– QuantumScape CEO and president Dr. Siva Sivaram

The company’s partnership with PowerCo, he noted, positions QuantumScape to scale its transformative technology to gigawatt-hour (GWh) production, and together they will “help usher in a new era of electrified transportation.”

According to the official announcement, the world’s first live demonstration of QS solid-state lithium-metal batteries powering an EV represents a significant advancement in battery technology and a big step towards commercializing solid-state EVs.

With this tech, the goal is to help advance the EV revolution, which PowerCo CEO Frank Blome says “is the biggest transformation the automotive industry has ever seen.”

SSBs will redefine what’s possible for high-performance, premium vehicles with the demonstration being just the beginning, he added.

QuantumScape’s Roadmap For Prototype to Production

With traditional lithium-ion batteries reaching the limits of their possible energy density and safety as portable electronics, electric vehicles, and renewable energy grids become more widespread and demanding, QuantumScape has turned to solid-state batteries to provide greater energy density, faster charging, and enhanced safety to support the transition to a lower-carbon future.

It is currently leading the global race of solid-state battery development, all set to bring its full-fledged solid-state cells to the EV market at scale in the near future.

The recent demonstration of its tech for the world to see actually sent the share prices of the $5 billion market cap company surging. At the time of writing, QS is trading at $8.85, up a whopping 70.52% YTD, though it is still far off its all-time high (ATH) of $132.73 hit late in 2020.

QuantumScape has an EPS (TTM) of -0.91 and a P/E (TTM) of -9.76.

As for the financial outlook, it reported capital expenditures of $8.3 million in Q2 of 2025. The expenses mainly supported facilities and equipment purchases as QuantumScape prepared for higher-volume QSE-5 B1 sample production during this period.

Its GAAP operating expenses were $123.6 million, GAAP net loss was $114.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA loss was $63 million.

The company ended the quarter with $797.5 million in liquidity and extended its guidance for cash runway into 2029.

QuantumScape actually expects to ship its sample cells for testing soon, with commercial production expected to begin in the next couple of years, depending on manufacturing scaling and regulatory approvals.

The B-sample cell called QSE-5 is the first planned commercial product of QuantumScape, which is designed to meet the EV sector’s need for batteries that must excel in five crucial battery performance metrics: cost-effectiveness, energy density, charging speed, safety, and lifespan.

The innovation here is the anode-less cell design, which simplifies manufacturing and lowers material costs while delivering high energy density. Paired with advanced separators, the design gives QuantumScape advantages in safety and efficiency.

It has replaced the organic separator with a nonflammable and noncombustible solid-state separator that provides more safety. Meanwhile, eliminating the graphite/silicon anode host material increases volumetric and gravimetric energy densities.

QuantumScape claims its QS technology has an 844 Wh/L energy density and 10C continuous discharge. Also, the lithium-metal solid-state battery takes just over 12 minutes (12.2 min) to charge from 10-80%.

If the technology is scaled successfully, it could become a standard for next-gen EVs as well as other energy storage solutions. The world premiere of the technology this month marks a big milestone towards that goal, which comes after a series of achievements.

Scaling QSE-5: From Pilot Lines to GWh Manufacturing

In order to bring QSE-5 to the real-world EVs as soon as possible, QuantumScape and PowerCo have been working together for three years now. The partnership combines QuantumScape’s talent with PowerCo’s manufacturing expertise.

Just a few months ago, the two expanded their strategic partnership to accelerate the development of the QSE-5 battery, which is currently being manufactured on QuantumScape’s San Jose pilot line, marking a major step forward in the industrialization of SSB technology.

This was the result of an agreement the two reached last year, under which QuantumScape gave PowerCo a non-exclusive license to mass produce the solid-state technology.

It allows PowerCo to produce up to 5 GWh of QSE-5-based cells annually in addition to the previously agreed 40 GWh with the option to expand up to 80 GWh, including for customers outside the VW Group. The expanded capacity is reportedly enough to equip about one million EVs with solid-state tech per year. The agreement also gives it the right to license certain future QS technology.

As a result, PowerCo will be contributing an additional $131 million over the next two years in exchange for QuantumScape prioritizing QSE-5 cells. The capital will help QS in scaling its manufacturing and making higher-volume prototype cell deliveries to the battery company.

QS first made its 24-layer solid-state cells available to Volkswagen Group for testing, back in Dec. 2022. The following year, it reported surpassing performance targets during testing. Early last year, PowerCo also ran its own endurance tests on QS cells and reported “very encouraging results.”

The Volkswagen Group’s battery arm confirmed that QS’s solid-state battery cells achieved over 1,000 charging cycles with more than 95% capacity retention.

The tests were conducted at PowerCo’s Salzgitter battery labs in Germany. The tests showed that an electric car with a WLTP range of 500-600 km (311-373 miles) outfitted with QS cells can drive about 500,000 kilometers (more than 310,000 miles) without losing range.

With these impressive results, Volkswagen aims to become “a global technology driver in the automotive industry,” but there’s still a long way to go before it can commercialize a marketable solution.

That could take the rest of the decade despite the recent promising showing. That’s because the first electric motorcycle presented at the IAA Mobility was extensively modified with the battery system designed specifically to fit the needs of the solid-state batteries, allowing the Ducati to be equipped with up to 980 QSE-5 cells.

Nevertheless, Volkswagen is committed to seeing this through and will be taking “the next step towards series production,” said Thomas Schmall, Group Board Member for Technology. With Volkswagen’s unified cell concept already suitable for QS cells, the focus will now be on refining and scaling the manufacturing processes.

Schmall noted that with their new in-house unified cell, they “have created the perfect match” as it is “solid state-ready” and enables rapid technology transfer to the company’s vehicles, as soon as the solid-state battery is ready.”

Ready to make its debut in upcoming small electric cars from VW, Cupra, and Skoda, the unified cell has an energy density of around 660 Wh/l and an entirely new design where the cells are installed directly into the pack.

At the event, Volkswagen said that the unified cell will be used in up to 80% of its own EVs in the future. While the cell type will stay the same, the cell chemistry may vary, allowing it to be “equipped with various cell chemistries from LFP and Sodium-Ion to NMC and Solid-State.”

PowerCo and QuantumScape are currently working on integrating solid-state technology into the unit cell and thus into the car. At the same time, a race-ready motorcycle will be developed for testing on the racetrack.

The Global Race Towards SSB Breakthroughs

Volkswagen is clearly making a lot of strides in leading the solid-state battery technology, but it isn’t alone in this endeavor. This week, Mercedes-Benz also announced records of its own.

A ‘lightly modified’ Mercedes EQS packed with a solid-state battery covered a distance of 1,205 km (748.7 miles) on one charge. After travelling from Stuttgart, Germany to Malmo, Sweden, it still had 137 km (85.12 miles) range left.

This new record broke the previous one set by the Vision EQXX by three kilometres. The road testing has been part of the company’s comprehensive validation program for solid-state battery technology under real-world conditions on public roads.

“The solid-state battery is a true game-changer for electric mobility. With the successful long-distance drive of the EQS, we show that this technology delivers not only in the lab but also on the road. Our goal is to bring innovations like this into series production by the end of the decade and offer our customers a new level of range and comfort.”

– Markus Schäfer, Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes‑Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer, Development & Procurement

For its battery, Factorial Energy provided the company with lithium-metal cells that are based on Factorial Electrolyte System Technology.

The Porsche-co-owned Croatian company, Rimac, is yet another one to showcase that SSBs can boost power, bring down weight, and solve the range issues that current batteries are facing. The new battery is developed in collaboration with Mitsubishi Chemical Group and ProLogium.

Presented at Munich’s IAA Mobility 2025, Rimac claims that its pouch-cell SSB has a power density of 1,000 watts per pound, weighs 847 pounds, and retains over 95% of its energy at -20 degrees Celsius (-7 F).

Among others working on advancing the tech is Toyota (TM -0.76%), which first revealed the world’s first prototype EV that ran on SSB back in 2020, only to share a couple of years later that a Toyota hybrid is more likely to get an SSB than an EV.

The best-selling automotive brand worldwide is actually expecting to begin the mass production of its first solid-state battery by 2027-2028. Toyota claims that its solid-state battery will deliver a 20% increase in cruising range and could charge from 10-80% in under 10 minutes.

Then there’s Honda (HMC -1.27%), whose solid-state battery pilot production line is already up and running. Located in Sakura, Japan, the automaker has invested about 43 billion yen, or about $290 million, in the facility to support next-generation EV battery development.

Its solid-state cells, according to Honda, could potentially be 25% cheaper, 35% lighter, and 50% smaller than current lithium-ion batteries. The Japanese automaker aims to start mass production of all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) in the second half of this decade.

The $46.8 bln market cap Ford (F -0.68%) is yet another auto manufacturer that is actively developing solid-state batteries. For its SSB efforts, Ford has partnered with startup Solid Power.

The company first invested in Solid Power in 2019 before making an additional equity investment in 2021 to help accelerate the development of technology. In that investment round, BMW Group also participated and became an equal equity owner with Ford.

“Solid-state batteries are showing great promise,” noted the carmaker at the time, adding, “they also can be made on today’s lithium-ion battery lines, allowing Ford to reuse about 70 percent of its capital investment in lithium-ion manufacturing lines.”

Ford EV partner SK On is also researching the technology with a number of Korean universities and institutions. It is developing two types of ASSBs, one with a polymer-oxide composite and the other being sulfide-based, with their commercial prototypes not expected until 2027 and 2029, respectively.

The Chinese technology company Huawei, meanwhile, reported a breakthrough, which is based on a nitrogen-doped sulfide SSB. It can reach energy densities between 400 and 500 Wh/kg, which is two to three times more than that of conventional lithium-ion EV batteries.

The solid-state EV battery from Huawei promises a driving range of up to 3,000 kilometers (1864 miles) on a single charge. Moreover, it has the ability to be fully recharged within five minutes.

Final Thoughts

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) promise to revolutionize the way we power electric vehicles (EVs), consumer electronics, and renewable energy systems. With their higher energy density, faster charging speeds, superior safety profile, and longer lifespans, they make for an ideal successor to lithium-ion technology.

But despite billions of dollars in investments from industry giants, significant hurdles remain. From reducing costs to scaling up manufacturing and ensuring long-term reliability on the road, challenges continue to persist. And that’s why solid-state cells are still largely in the development phase, requiring extensive testing and validation before they can be deployed in the real world at scale.

Latest advancements, however, paint a promising picture. QuantumScape’s live demonstrations, PowerCo’s endurance tests, and record-setting long-distance drives from Mercedes-Benz signal that the industry is finally moving closer to overcoming these barriers.

So, as partnerships grow, pilot production lines expand, and innovative designs continue to emerge, solid-state batteries look ready to become mainstream this decade, unlocking a new era of electric mobility and sustainable energy solutions.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

Solar energy is for everywhere and everyone, and its future is in our hands.
Reno's Sun Day Solar Festival will be held from noon to 4 p.m. on Sept. 21 at Idlewild Park.","Recent months have brought sobering news for people who want to lower their energy bills with solar. The Solar for All program is on the chopping block, and tax credits that made renewable energy more accessible to working families are being repealed. These setbacks affect real people — families who were counting on solar to reduce their electricity bills, small business owners planning to invest in renewable energy and communities working toward energy independence.

But federal policy changes can't squash the power of local action.

We still have renewable energy initiatives and climate goals in municipalities across Nevada. At the state level, utility commissioners and legislators directly impact whether solar owners can earn fair credit for the electricity they generate, and whether community solar projects expand or remain stagnant. These are regulators and legislators whose decisions we can influence. We need to use our power to ensure they prioritize policies that benefit working families and local communities.

This is precisely why events like Reno's Sun Day Solar Festival on Sept. 21 are so important. Part of a nationwide movement held on the fall equinox, Sun Day will bring communities across the country together to demonstrate the power of grassroots solar advocacy. But Sun Day is also deeply local — a reminder that the renewable energy transition happens one neighborhood, one rooftop, one informed voter at a time.

Held in Idlewild Park, Reno’s Sun Day Solar Festival will offer families a chance to see solar technology in action, learn about community solar options and understand how renewable energy can reduce household expenses while supporting local jobs. Kids can participate in hands-on art projects while parents explore practical questions: How much could solar save on monthly utility bills? What financing options exist? How can residents influence local energy policies?

Federal setbacks are discouraging, but they're not the end of the story. The sun rises every day, technology improves continuously and communities that organize effectively can achieve remarkable things. Local action builds resilience that no single election can undo.

Solar energy continues to grow because it makes economic sense. Renewable energy costs have plummeted, making them competitive with traditional sources, even without subsidies. But growth isn't guaranteed to benefit everyone equally. Without thoughtful local policies, the solar energy transition could leave behind the very communities that need economic relief most.

If you're concerned about the future of solar energy — whether for economic, environmental, or energy security reasons — the most powerful response isn't to despair about federal politics. It's to show up locally, learn practically, and engage consistently.

As a solar owner, I’ve seen firsthand how solar can benefit our community. I love my rooftop solar system. With net metering, it supplies enough energy to power my home all year round with the knowledge that I am using pure renewable energy from the sun. And any excess is used by my neighbors so that they are greener, too!

Take action on Sun Day. Solar energy is for everywhere and everyone, and its future is in our hands. I’ll see you in Idlewild Park on Sept. 21.

At the price point of $69,990, it was the cheapest Cybertruck variant launched in April this year. Tesla stripped down several features and options from this cheaper RWD Cybertruck.

As the September 30th deadline for the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit is closing in, the electric automaker has removed the Cybertruck Long Range RWD variant from its online car configurator.

Now, only two Cybertruck trims, i.e., Long Range AWD and the top-tier Tri-Motor Cyberbeast are available for sale. It’s hard to tell if and when the Cybertruck RWD will be put back on sale.

Although Tesla offered a more affordable version of the Cybertruck, it did not add a significant number of sales units to the second quarter. The trimmed-down single-motor RWD Cybertruck most probably didn’t create the appeal that the automaker was expecting with the launch.

The mid-tier Cybertruck AWD is the most value-for-money option and most of the Tesla customers are most probably opting for this variant. Cybertruck AWD’s MSRP is $79,990. After the Federal EV Tax Credit deduction of $7,500, the price of the electric pickup truck goes down to $72,490.

Existing Tesla owners can also benefit from transferring their Full Self-Driving (Supervised) package to their new Cybertruck AWD. The Cyberbeast performance variant’s price of $114,990 includes the FSD package.

Tesla Full Self-Driving (Supervised) package costs $8,000 additionally on the AWD Cybertruck. By transferring it from the previous vehicle, you can save another $8K on it if you’re eligible for it (see FSD transfer eligibility criteria below).

Buying the Cybertruck AWD Long Range version also gives you the benefit of a 0% APR (annual percentage rate). With a down payment of $5,000, the Cybertruck on financing costs $1,291 per month (60-month term with Federal Tax Credit and the FSD bundle).

Although Tesla said that the 0% APR offer would end in June, the automaker is still offering it on the Cybertruck AWD.

Tesla also discontinued the RWD variant of the Cybertruck because, after the tax credit and 0% APR offer, the Cybertruck AWD costs just a bit more with an all-wheel drivetrain, additional features, and better specs (comparison here).

Eligibility for FSD Transfer to Cybertruck

To be eligible for this offer, you must:

Have your new Tesla vehicle delivered on or after April 24, 2025, but before the program ends;

Be the legal owner and registrant of the current vehicle with Full Self-Driving (Supervised) purchased outright until Tesla can remove the FSD (Supervised) from the vehicle (about 48 hours after delivery of your new vehicle);

Have the current vehicle and the new vehicle on the same Tesla Account; and

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.” The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintelligencer.net/images/2025/09/12221540/AP25255740590738-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:39.383245

The disbanding was first reported by CNN and now NPR has confirmed that Wright wrote a letter on September 3rd to the five hand-picked members of the group, thanking them for their service.

The decision to disband the CWG came as a hearing was held this week in a lawsuit that the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists had filed against the Trump administration. As NPR reported previously, the suit alleges that Energy Secretary Chris Wright ""quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change"" to compile the government's climate report and violated the law by creating the report in secret with authors ""of only one point of view.""

Wright wrote in the letter that the purpose of the group and its report was ""to catalyze scientific and public debate"" and that the result ""exceeded my expectations."" Wright concluded that with that goal met the CWG could now be dissolved.

The CWG consisted of four scientists and one economist who have all questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses huge threats to people and ecosystems and who sometimes framed global warming as beneficial.

The report was drafted to support a Trump administration effort to stop regulating climate pollution. The DOE report was cited multiple times by the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent proposal to roll back what's known as the endangerment finding, which is the basis for federal rules regulating climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Climate Working Group was convened in secrecy, and it created a clandestine report – in brazen violation of federal law – that is being used to weaken protections against the climate pollution that makes life less safe and less affordable for all Americans,"" Erin Murphy, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a statement.

The environmental groups want a court to throw out the CWG report, but at a conference in Belgium Friday, Wright praised the document for prompting ""open, back and forth dialogue.""

""That's what we want is to bring people that have different perspectives or disagree to dialogue together and argue it out,"" Wright told the crowd.

For all but a small segment of scientists, the debate Wright wants to prompt has already been settled.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, coordinated the response from climate experts. He says unlike the DOE report, climate reports from groups such as the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change feature the work of hundreds of global scientists and require multiple rounds of peer review.

""When well-established scientific conclusions are challenged by arguments that ignore or contradict decades of solid evidence, these debates don't advance our understanding,"" Dessler wrote to NPR in a statement.

Bowing to the bear For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight.","California is once again at the center of the nation’s automotive and energy policy debate. With federal electric vehicle tax credits set to expire this September, the state is considering whether to create its own replacement program.

This would not only affect car buyers but could also reshape the national conversation on emissions rules, vehicle affordability, and the balance of power between state and federal regulators.

With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a report on August 19 recommending that the state consider “backfilling” the federal credits with its own point-of-sale rebates, vouchers, or other incentives to keep EV sales moving.

The details remain vague, but the intention is clear: California wants to keep its aggressive zero-emission vehicle goals on track, even as Washington scales back related programs.

Emissions mission

But California has been here before. This is not the first time the state has clashed with the federal government over vehicle regulations — and it likely won’t be the last.

California has a unique history when it comes to vehicle emissions. Decades before the federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency, California was already regulating air quality in response to its smog problem.

When the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, California was granted a waiver that allowed it to set its own stricter emissions standards. Other states were given the option to adopt California’s rules, and some states have done so. Today, 11 states follow California’s lead.

This waiver authority has made California an outsize force in shaping vehicle propulsion. Automakers cannot ignore a market of this size, which means California’s rules often become de facto national standards.

Better red than fed

California’s regulatory independence has not always sat well with Washington. Under different administrations, the federal government has either supported or resisted the state’s authority. During the Obama years, California partnered with the federal government to create a unified fuel economy and emissions program, giving automakers a single set of national rules.

Under the Trump administration, the EPA rolled back certain emissions standards, sparking legal battles with California, which insisted on enforcing its own tougher rules. The state formed alliances with other states and even some automakers to defend its position.

Today, with federal EV tax credits expiring at the end of September and policy focus shifting, California is again stepping into the driver’s seat by proposing its own financial incentives. These ongoing disputes highlight a deeper question: Should environmental and automotive policy be driven by national uniformity or by one state acting as the policy leader?

Forever ZEV?

The discussion over tax credits cannot be separated from California’s ZEV mandate. Under CARB’s plan, automakers must steadily increase the percentage of EVs they sell, with the ultimate goal of phasing out new gasoline-powered vehicle sales by 2035.

This is one of the most ambitious policies in the country, and automakers are scrambling to meet the targets. Some states, such as New York and Massachusetts, have pledged to follow California’s lead, while others remain skeptical. For consumers, this means that vehicle availability will increasingly be shaped by government mandates and not by market demand. Even if gas-powered cars remain popular, automakers will need to balance that demand with regulatory compliance.

Different strokes

The CARB report suggests that any new program would differ from the federal credits in key ways. Instead of tax credits, buyers could receive point-of-sale rebates, allowing them to benefit immediately rather than waiting until tax season.

Incentives may also vary depending on income level, vehicle type, or price, so luxury EVs could receive lower rebates while affordable models get more support.

Additionally, any new program would be tied to yearly funding availability, meaning that if budgets tighten, rebates could shrink or disappear. This approach could make the system more flexible, but it also introduces uncertainty for buyers trying to plan their purchases. In the past, the state of California and other states have run out of money in the EV fund and left buyers with nothing.

Electric slide

The promise of continued incentives may be welcome news for some California drivers, but the reality is more complicated. EVs still come with challenges beyond sticker price. Even with rebates, EVs are often thousands of dollars more expensive than comparable gasoline cars.

California has built more chargers than any other state, yet many regions remain underserved, and home charging is not always an option, particularly for renters.

EVs also tend to depreciate faster than gas vehicles due to rapid advances in technology and concerns about battery life. Insurance rates are higher on electric vehicles as well.

And let’s not forget a major expense: Electricity rates are rising at double the rate of inflation.

One of the key criticisms of EV subsidies is that they often benefit wealthier households. Data from federal programs has shown that a large percentage of credits went to buyers in higher income brackets because these households are more likely to purchase new cars, and EVs remain disproportionately concentrated in the premium market segment.

California may attempt to address this with scaled incentives, but questions remain about whether the system can truly deliver benefits to everyone. Meanwhile, working-class families who rely on affordable used cars may find themselves subsidizing programs that they cannot realistically take advantage of.

Bowing to the bear

For automakers, California’s decisions carry immense weight. The state accounts for nearly 12% of U.S. auto sales, and when you include the other states that follow its rules, the market share becomes impossible to ignore.

Manufacturers that fail to meet California’s requirements face penalties, while those that comply can earn credits to sell or trade. This system has created an uneven playing field, favoring companies with strong EV lineups.

Tesla, for instance, has profited significantly from selling ZEV credits to competitors in the past. If California establishes a robust new rebate system, it could further tilt the market toward EVs, encouraging automakers to prioritize them even more, take greater losses on each vehicle.

Off the market

At its core, this debate is about whether government policy should drive technology adoption or whether the market should dictate the pace.

California argues that aggressive incentives and mandates are necessary to address climate goals and push the auto industry forward. Critics counter that these policies distort the market, forcing automakers and taxpayers to shoulder costs that may not align with consumer demand. They also warn of unintended consequences, such as reduced affordability, lack of charging stations, and strained electrical infrastructure.

California’s proposal to replace expiring federal EV tax credits with state-funded incentives is the latest chapter in a decades-long story of the state asserting its role as the nation’s automotive regulator.

With its ZEV mandate and aggressive environmental policies, California is pushing automakers, consumers, and policymakers to adapt — whether they’re ready or not.

For some wealthier car buyers, this could mean continued financial support when purchasing an EV, but it also raises questions about long-term effectiveness. For taxpayers, it means another debate about where funds should be directed and increased taxes for residents. For the auto industry, it underscores more losses on vehicles that are designed by one state’s demands.

As history shows, when California moves, the rest of the country often feels the impact. The next few months will reveal whether the state can successfully design a program that keeps EV sales going without overburdening its citizens with more increased taxes.

Generally speaking, we expect EV sales to then drop after September 30, because those financial incentives will be gone and people who were thinking of buying an EV soon-ish rushed to buy one before October 1.
Without that manufactured surge of 2nd quarter 2025 EV buyers, perhaps it would take longer for those next-wave buyers to go electric.
The counterargument might be that keeping the tax credit would lead to more EV buyers quarter after quarter, resulting in those word-of-mouth sales coming slightly slower but for a longer period of time and more consistently.
I’m open minded and, for example, don’t know which would actually lead to us getting to 50% EV sales sooner.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

This is actually a simple one, so I’ll keep it quick. I’m not sure if we’ve ever presented this argument at all, and certainly not as a standalone article. Because it’s a clear sequence of points, I’m going to use a numbered list to get rolling.

In the United States, the $7,500 tax credit for purchasing new electric vehicles and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing used electric vehicles are about to end.

That is leading to a surge in EV purchases this quarter.

Generally speaking, we expect EV sales to then drop after September 30, because those financial incentives will be gone and people who were thinking of buying an EV soon-ish rushed to buy one before October 1.

However, we’ve also argued for years that the benefits of electric vehicles for EV owners and drivers are significant and will naturally lead to more and more people switching from gas-guzzling cars to electric cars they can conveniently charge at their homes and workplaces.

So, when this surge of Q2 2025 EV buyers get their electric vehicles, love them, and discover how much better they are than their gas cars ever were, they are going to talk to their friends, family, and coworkers about this. (This happens time after time after time with new EV owners.)

As a result, even without the financial subsidies, that wave of new EV owners is going to lead to many more people becoming more aware of EVs, aware of their advantages, and open to getting EVs themselves. That could be a very large portion of the “early majority” that switches from not thinking about or genuinely considering an EV to being intrigued and attracted to going electric (like their friend, family member, or coworker did).

Some percentage of those people are going to then go on to buying an electric car.

Perhaps that last part won’t happen quickly. People need some time to let their thoughts simmer and seep in, and need some time to plan such a big purchase. Also, they may feel like they shouldn’t buy an EV right away since that would be conceding that they could have bought one a month or two earlier and gotten a big discount on it — and people often don’t like to admit that they made a mistake, even with the timing of a purchase. However, creating a surge of EV buyers thanks to the ending of two tax credits should eventually lead to a second and third wave of people influenced by them buying EVs as well.

Without that manufactured surge of 2nd quarter 2025 EV buyers, perhaps it would take longer for those next-wave buyers to go electric. The counterargument might be that keeping the tax credit would lead to more EV buyers quarter after quarter, resulting in those word-of-mouth sales coming slightly slower but for a longer period of time and more consistently. I would say I agree with that. However, there is the possibility that the net benefit of accelerating many EV purchases by even a couple of quarters is stronger since those word-of-mouth sales grow faster at a fairly high scale and then snowball and accelerate the transition. I don’t really have a strong opinion either way on this. I’m open minded and, for example, don’t know which would actually lead to us getting to 50% EV sales sooner. Of course, the best of all worlds would be phasing out the subsidies, benefiting from this surge of sales, and then getting a change of power that brings back the tax credits. Some people will disagree that this boom-&-bust-&-boom cycle would be better, and maybe they are right, but I do think this would accelerate adoption the most.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Chevy-Blazer-EV-SS.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:21.357244

""If Americans can be convinced of the real advantages of EVs, there's nowhere to go but up,"" EnergySage concluded.","With federal tax incentives for electric vehicles on the brink of their end date, a popular marketplace detailed myths about the clean automobiles. It noted that the United States is well behind other countries in adopting EVs.

In Norway, 90% of new vehicle sales are electric. That figure is 63% in Sweden and around 30% in the United Kingdom and China, EnergySage reported. The U.S. is at 9%.

""There's a stigma against EVs here that doesn't exist in other places, and a lot of it may stem from fossil fuel propaganda,"" the site stated. It added: ""It's time to debunk these myths once and for all.""

Big Oil, of course, has much to lose if EVs win. EnergySage noted lobbyists spent $7 million in 2021 just to work against a proposal to limit vehicle pollution from new cars, which was not set to begin until 2027.

EnergySage interviewed a trio of automobile industry experts, including Jonny Lieberman, who hosts Driving with Jonny (@drivingwithjonny). He cited people who have no interest in EVs and fear problems, such as fires, in saying, ""Every time one of those is brought up, it just strikes me as propaganda by Chevron, Shell, or the petroleum industry.""

Nikki Gordon-Bloomfield, who created Transport Evolved (@transportevolved), called it a ""perfect storm of political misinformation and fossil fuel lobbying — lobbyists in America are very, very powerful.""

To counter four myths, the independent clean energy platform laid out how EVs are not much more expensive than gas-powered cars. It noted that states, municipalities, utilities, and manufacturers also offer incentives similar to the federal tax credits — $7,500 for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one — that will expire Sept. 30. Home charging and the absence of regular maintenance needs help EV drivers break even after a few years, Gordon-Bloomfield said.

Range anxiety is also mostly a thing of the past, as today's EVs can travel 300-400 miles on one charge. The average American drives 29 miles in one day, according to the Department of Transportation. And ""even in the absolute worst conditions,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said, the charging time to reach 80% battery maxes out at 90 minutes.

EVs are far less prone to catch fire than their counterparts, with 25 blazes per 100,000 EVs sold. The rate is over 60 times higher for gas-powered vehicles, at 1,530 per 100,000. Batteries also last for 10-12 years, State of Charge (@StateOfChargeWithTomMoloughney) host Tom Moloughney told EnergySage, and they can be 80-90% efficient. Internal combustion engines are 20% efficient, with the remaining 80% of dirty energy use producing waste heat and noise, per Lieberman.

Finally, the EV industry is suffering from a crisis of confidence, per the experts. Despite their instant torque, high-tech features, and quiet cabins, electric vehicles are not as trendy as gas-powered vehicles in the eyes of consumers.

""In other countries, cars are sold very differently. In America, cars are very often seen as a status symbol, they're seen as an extension of the self,"" Gordon-Bloomfield said. ""We're buying more on image than we are on actual substance.""

In fact, EVs are converting drivers from India to France to the U.S. And almost all of them say they will never go back.

This pilot is possible through the California Energy Commission’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program Option 3.

“Silicon Valley Power is committed to exploring innovative solutions that keep our community powered reliably and affordably,” said Nico Procos, Electric Utility Director of Silicon Valley Power. “This pilot demonstrates how collaboration with industry leaders like Nissan and ChargeScape can help to strengthen grid reliability, support local businesses, and benefit our customers.”

Silicon Valley is one of the world’s data center hotspots. The rise of AI has caused a surge in electricity demand coming from data centers, which many power grids were not designed to withstand, a news release noted.

“Forward-thinking utilities such as Silicon Valley Power are seeking innovative ways to quickly increase power supply to meet this new demand, in order to ensure grid reliability for all customers,” the news release added.

At Nissan’s Advanced Technology Center in Silicon Valley, this pilot will use energy stored in EV batteries from Nissan electric vehicles, managed by Fermata Energy’s bidirectional chargers, to export power during periods of grid strain. ChargeScape will coordinate with market partner Leap to discharge power from Nissan vehicles and free up supply for data center loads.

The pilot is part of ChargeScape and Leap’s broader California Virtual Power Plant.

“Through this collaboration, we’re showcasing how electric vehicles can reinforce our communities’ electrical needs and deliver meaningful benefits to drivers,” said Rich Miller, Vice President of Vehicle Connected Services at Nissan U.S.

“AI is a fundamental component of American Dynamism, and our nation’s power grids must quickly adapt to supply data centers with the energy needed to maintain America’s competitive edge in places like Silicon Valley,” said Joseph Vellone, CEO of ChargeScape. “Integrating Nissan’s EV batteries into Silicon Valley Power’s grid is a crucial first step to shoring up long-term grid reliability and rewarding the EV drivers who are part of the solution.”

“At Fermata Energy, we are demonstrating how AI-enabled V2X optimization can transform electric vehicles into intelligent grid resources,” said Hamza Lemsaddek, Chief Operating Officer of Fermata Energy. “By pairing our platform with bidirectional chargers at Nissan’s Innovation Lab, we’re proving that EVs can strengthen data center reliability, support utilities like Silicon Valley Power, and deliver real economic value back to drivers and communities.”

“Our work with ChargeScape has shown the powerful potential of harnessing the EVs already on the road today to tackle urgent grid reliability challenges,” said Jason Michaels, CEO of Leap. “Activating these vehicles as flexible, dispatchable grid resources is a game-changing tool to help utilities manage higher loads and unlock economic growth while putting dollars back in the hands of ratepayers. We look forward to expanding our partnership with ChargeScape to serve more communities.”",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-13 12:00:24.856317

Enter Liquid Air Energy Storage (LAES), a long-duration storage solution that promises to bridge the gap between intermittent renewables and grid reliability. While MIT's models on

scalability and economic viability remain elusive, industry trends and technological fundamentals suggest that LAES is poised to play a pivotal role in the next phase of energy infrastructure.

The Case for LAES: Clean, Scalable, and Economically Viable

LAES operates by compressing air to a liquid state using excess renewable energy, storing it in insulated tanks, and later expanding the liquid air to drive turbines and generate electricity. Unlike lithium-ion batteries, LAES avoids critical mineral dependencies and offers near-limitless scalability, as it relies on abundant, non-flammable materials like air and salt caverns for storage. According to a 2023 report by BloombergNEF, long-duration storage technologies like LAES are projected to account for 30% of global storage capacity by 2040, driven by their ability to stabilize grids with high renewable penetration.

Economically, LAES is gaining traction due to its declining costs. A 2024 analysis by Wood Mackenzie found that the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) for LAES could fall below $0.05/kWh by 2035, rivaling pumped hydro and outcompeting flow batteries in duration-sensitive applications. This aligns with the growing demand for 10–100-hour storage solutions, which are critical for seasonal balancing and extreme weather resilience.

Decarbonization Scenarios and Strategic Integration

Under aggressive decarbonization scenarios, LAES's role becomes even more pronounced. For instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) highlights in its 2023 Net Zero Roadmap that long-duration storage will be indispensable for achieving 90% renewable grids by 2040. LAES's ability to leverage existing infrastructure—such as decommissioned gas plants for liquid air storage—further enhances its economic appeal. In the UK, a 50 MW/250 MWh LAES pilot project by Highview Power has already demonstrated 85% round-trip efficiency, validating its technical feasibility.

Market Dynamics and Investment Opportunities

While academic models like MIT's remain absent from public discourse, corporate activity signals strong confidence. Startups like LAES Co. and established players like Siemens Energy are scaling prototypes, with over $2 billion in global investments announced in 2024 alone. Meanwhile, policy tailwinds, including the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's 10-year tax credits for long-duration storage, are accelerating deployment timelines.

For investors, the key is to identify enablers of LAES adoption. For example,

Corp (ticker: LAES), a semiconductor firm specializing in secure microcontrollers for smart energy systems, underscores the growing intersection of hardware security and grid modernization. Though not directly involved in LAES, SEALSQ's growth—projected to hit $20 million in FY 2025 revenue—reflects the broader demand for technologies that underpin reliable, decentralized energy networks.

Now Is the Time to Position

The convergence of technological maturity, falling costs, and policy support positions LAES as a strategic long-duration storage solution. While MIT's research on its scalability remains unverified, the industry's momentum is undeniable. For forward-looking investors, exposure to LAES—whether through direct infrastructure investments or enablers like secure grid technologies—offers a compelling hedge against the volatility of short-term energy markets.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd264379cbc001.png,N,,2025-09-13 15:59:46.506152

In Detail : The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) is reportedly considering tax incentives for investors in green bonds. The proposal aims to boost private sector participation in renewable energy and climate-focused projects across India.

Green bonds are financial instruments used to fund environmentally sustainable projects, including solar, wind, and energy efficiency initiatives. Incentivizing investment in these bonds could channel more capital into the clean energy sector.

By offering tax benefits, the MNRE intends to make green bonds more attractive to retail and institutional investors alike. This could increase demand and liquidity in the green bond market, supporting project financing.

The move aligns with India’s broader climate and sustainability objectives, including achieving net-zero emissions targets and expanding renewable energy capacity. Mobilizing private capital is critical to meet these ambitious goals.

Industry experts believe that fiscal incentives could accelerate the adoption of green finance mechanisms. By reducing investment costs, such measures can encourage participation from banks, funds, and individual investors in renewable energy projects.

The MNRE’s proposal also signals government commitment to developing a robust ecosystem for green financing. Incentivizing green bonds can complement other initiatives like the Renewable Energy Development Fund and carbon credit markets.

Increasing green bond investments can help fund large-scale solar, wind, and hydro projects. The additional capital inflow will also support distributed renewable energy solutions, energy storage, and decarbonization technologies.

Tax incentives could further enhance investor confidence in long-term sustainable projects.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""burdensome"" and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency's statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

""It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation's prosperity and hurting American communities,'' he said. ""With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA's statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.''

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program ""blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.""

By hiding pollution information from the public, ""Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,"" Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people's health.""

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal ""a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don't know who the polluters are, they can't do anything to hold them responsible.""

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers ""have depended on this data"" for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to ""focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.""

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

This focus on sustainable resources is part of the company's strategic initiatives in tyre manufacturing.

The company has reported that, in 2024, around 26% of its materials were derived from these sources, setting the stage for a steady increase by up to three percentage points by 2025.

Ultimately, Continental aims to integrate at least 40% sustainable materials by 2030.

“We’re closing the loop: Continental is ramping up its commitment to a circular economy and mapping out its path for the future,” says Jorge Almeida, Head of Sustainability at Continental Tires.

“Innovative solutions enable us to use more sustainable raw materials, such as synthetic rubber made from used cooking oil or resins based on certified renewable feedstocks originally derived from vegetable oil.”

Enhanced energy efficiency in tyres

Remaking the tyre compound involves resins that improve elasticity, grip and rolling resistance.

Continental chooses circular resins from ISCC PLUS-certified sources, incorporating products from TotalEnergies Cray Valley.

The use of resins from derivatives of vegetable oil and used cooking oil allows the company to maintain high-performance standards with a lower ecological impact.

Adjustment in tyre's elasticity affects energy demand during use, enhancing rolling resistance to reduce fuel consumption in combustion vehicles and increase range in electric vehicles.

Additionally, Continental has pioneered the use of ISCC PLUS-certified TMQ, an antioxidant developed by LANXESS.

This additive includes bio-circular acetone sourced from waste cooking oil, and life cycle assessments highlight a 30% reduction in carbon footprint compared to conventional counterparts.

Implementing mass balance in production

To promote renewable and recycled input scalability, Continental employs a mass balance approach throughout its production process.

This methodology merges fossil, renewable and recycled sources within a unified process, meticulously tracing each component’s contribution along the value chain.

“The mass balance approach enables us to efficiently manage the complexity of the raw materials portfolio and track how these raw materials are used at multiple production sites in a wide range of markets,” explains Matthias Haufe, Head of Material Development and Industrialisation at Continental Tires.

“In this way, we can steadily increase the share of renewable and recycled materials in our tyre production – and transparently document the progress we make.”

Renewable energy is no longer an indulgence from climate change considerations; it has become the rational economic choice.

A little over a decade ago, renewable energy sources were still struggling to find a meaningful place in India’s electricity supply basket on cost considerations. Solar electricity tariffs, just a decade ago, were of the order of US $0.15 (Rs 13) per unit (at an exchange rate of 1 USD = Rs 88), significantly higher than the price of new coal-based electricity.

Policymakers, utilities, and even sections of society questioned whether it made sense for a developing country to lock itself into high-cost electricity when coal was abundantly available to produce electricity at affordable tariffs. That debate now feels distant.

The cost factor

Solar electricity tariffs in India have fallen to USD 0.028 (Rs.2.50) per kWh, with record lows that are not only far less than the price of electricity from new coal-based plants but also undercut even the cheapest existing coal plants.

Wind energy tariffs after witnessing a declining trajectory untill 2017-2018, touching USD 0.028 (Rs 2.43) per kWh before rising close to USD 0.043 (Rs 3.75) per kWh.

This transformation was driven by global technology improvements, economies of scale, and appropriate policy choices—ranging from clear short and long-term targets, aggregation of demand and competitive auctions to facilitating regulatory support.

The resolution of the “cost equation” marked a turning point. As costs declined, however, other concerns came centre-stage.

Land and environmental concerns

During 2016–2024, record low tariffs were discovered for mega-solar parks in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Karnataka. While solar parks gave a thrust to large-scale renewable energy capacity addition, it gave rise to a number of concerns in view of their large areas.

The stakeholders’ concern is about loss of land — a reliable asset and source of permanent income. Large solar parks involve displacement of communities and an impact on biodiversity and fragile ecosystems.

Decentralised renewable energy, dual-land use renewable energy options such as agrivoltaics which combine agriculture and solar energy generation, floating solar, and building integrated photovoltaics are emerging as promising options to reduce pressure on land.

Rooftop solar which was not progressing at the required pace got a fillip through PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijlee Yojana. A good number of AgriPV pilots’ projects are providing learning for scaling them up.

Variability and round-the-clock power

Coal power plants provide round-the-clock, dispatchable generation, while solar and wind are variable and intermittent. “What happens when the sun doesn’t shine, or the wind doesn’t blow?” became the next critical concern.

Green energy transmission corridors were developed to make full use of renewable energy by facilitating its delivery to demand centres. Hybrid renewable energy projects combining wind and solar, reaping the benefit of their complementarity, offered a better bouquet.

Time-of-day tariffs and enhanced flexibility of conventional power plants assumed importance. And most importantly, energy storage found a place in the discussion in a big way.

This phase underscored an important reality: the transition to clean energy is not merely about clean energy generation, but also its utilisation matching the demand profile across the year.

The energy storage imperative

Today, the dominant concern in the context of integration of renewable energy are energy storage and reliability of supply. Critics argue that without affordable energy storage, India risks overbuilding renewable capacity that cannot be fully utilised.

Just as solar costs were once thought to be prohibitively high but fell rapidly with scale, energy storage is also expected to follow a downward cost trajectory as it finds use for various applications with recognition of the value proposition BESS offers, new technologies mature, and innovation accelerates.

Global battery prices are declining faster than anticipated. Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) costs in India have declined 80 percent since 2015. The standalone BESS prices fell significantly from US $ 0.11 (Rs. 10.18) per kWh in 2022 to US $ 0.025-0.05 (Rs. 2.21 – 4.41) per kWh in 2024.

The viability gap funding announced by the government in June for developing 30 GWh of BESS capacity is expected to address the affordability concerns.

Policy Circle is now on Telegram. Click here to join the channel.

Domestic manufacturing is being incentivised in the country through the Production Linked Incentive for advanced chemistry cell battery storage and high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules. Cost-effective long-duration energy storage is the next frontier.

Beyond technology: People and transition

Alongside cost reduction and technological advancement one of the most critical concerns remains to be addressed: the human dimension of the energy transition. As coal-dependent regions confront the reality of declining coal production, concerns of jobs, livelihoods, and regional development loom large.

A “just transition” approach—ensuring that workers, communities, and vulnerable segments are not left behind—has begun to shape policy and public discourse. This shift signals the recognition that technology alone cannot drive the change; it must be embedded in a people-centric framework.

The turnaround and the outlook

India’s renewable energy journey began in the 1980s with early wind projects in Tamil Nadu. The small-scale solar applications were supported by the then Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources. The real turning point came with the launch of the National Solar Mission in 2010, which brought solar to the centre stage and became the heart of India’s energy development and transition strategy.

From these modest beginnings, the country has now built one of the world’s largest renewable energy markets, with solar leading the way.

The scale has, in a matter of 15 years, dramatically tilted towards solar power as compared to coal-based power. Solar power had to be bundled with thermal power to make it an attractive proposition for the DISCOMs. This is no longer the case. The tariff of electricity from ground-mounted solar power plants and wind is of the order of US $ 0.028 (Rs. 2.50) per kWh and US $ 0.039 (Rs. 3.50) per kWh, respectively.

The cost of electricity from hybrid wind-solar plants in recent years has ranged from US $0.038-0.039 (Rs. 3.35 to Rs. 3.45) per kWh. A combination of solar-wind hybrid (to be used alternatively when either sun or wind are not available) along with storage is making round the clock renewable energy achievable at attractive tariffs – US $ 0.048 and 0.056 (Rs. 4.00 to 5.00) per kWh during 2023-2025.

The falling costs of storage, along with low-cost hybrid plants, make renewable electricity not only cheaper but also more reliable—helping India’s energy transition by reducing dependence on fossil fuels while ensuring round-the-clock power.

Looking ahead, solar power with longer-duration energy storage is expected to become cost-effective, emerging as an economically viable option for consumers as well as energy distribution companies. Skilling and re-skilling of workforce which is directly or indirectly dependent/ engaged in coal mining and transportation is a prerequisite for effective clean energy transition.

General Motors, for instance, reported its highest-ever monthly EV sales, propelled by models like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which climbed into the top sellers list. Meanwhile, Ford’s Mustang Mach-E also posted strong numbers, contributing to a diversified field where non-Tesla brands claimed a larger slice of the pie.

According to a report from Electrek, Tesla’s sales dipped as rivals like GM and Ford gained ground, with the company’s share slipping below 50% for the first time in recent memory. This trend reflects broader industry maturation, where Tesla’s once-novel appeal faces headwinds from improved offerings by competitors, including better range, faster charging, and more affordable entry points.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry observers echoed this sentiment, with users like energy analyst Jesse Jenkins highlighting August’s plug-in vehicle sales hitting 145,000 units and battery EVs achieving an 8.6% share—figures that debunk narratives of stalled EV growth. Such social media buzz underscores real-time enthusiasm, though it also reveals concerns about sustainability without ongoing subsidies.

Policy Shadows Looming Over Future Growth

The August rush appears tied directly to the impending expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act, set to phase out by month’s end as the incoming Trump administration signals a pullback on EV support. A piece in The Washington Post warns that this policy shift could trigger a sharp sales decline in the fourth quarter, with analysts forecasting a potential 20% drop as affordability takes a hit for middle-income buyers.

Beyond incentives, infrastructure remains a critical bottleneck. The International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook 2025 notes that while charging networks have expanded, rural and urban disparities persist, potentially capping long-term adoption. Recent web searches confirm global contrasts: worldwide EV sales grew 25% through August, per Startup News, but North America’s 6% increase lags behind Asia’s boom, where China alone saw NEV market share exceed 50%.

Market Diversification and Consumer Shifts

Drilling deeper, the sales data from Argonne National Laboratory’s monthly updates illustrates a maturing ecosystem, with plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and battery EVs (BEVs) both contributing to the record. Hybrids, in particular, surged as a bridge technology for range-anxious consumers, comprising a growing portion of electrified sales. Cox Automotive’s Q1 2025 report, which tracked a 10% year-over-year EV growth, set the stage for August’s peak, though it also flagged Tesla’s early declines.

Industry insiders whisper of strategic pivots ahead. Automakers are ramping up domestic production to qualify for any remaining incentives, while investing in battery tech to reduce costs. A IEA analysis projects that by 2030, EVs could claim 30% of U.S. sales if infrastructure investments accelerate, but regulatory rollbacks pose risks.

Sustainability Challenges and Long-Term Outlook

Environmental advocates celebrate August’s figures as a win for emissions reduction, yet supply-chain vulnerabilities loom. Rare-earth mineral dependencies and recycling hurdles could inflate prices, as noted in Virta’s global market overview. On X, posts from accounts like The Electric Viking amplify optimism, sharing videos of record-smashing sales, but they also caution against overreliance on Tesla’s ecosystem.

As the dust settles, August 2025 stands as a high-water mark, but the road ahead demands innovation beyond incentives. Automakers must navigate political winds, consumer skepticism, and technological leaps to sustain momentum. For now, the numbers speak volumes: EVs are no longer niche—they’re mainstream, if precariously so.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-212d8ec6-7fbd-47c3-91e8-66777baa6b2c.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:54.690330

The Oradea project is Econergy's fourth solar installation to go live in Romania. Together, the company's operational and ready-to-connect projects in the country now total 447 megawatts, the news outlet reported.

This momentum means more renewable power for households and businesses. Large-scale solar farms like Oradea can lower energy costs by bringing affordable electricity to the grid. They can also strengthen grid stability, reduce reliance on imported fuels, and support job growth in regions where new energy infrastructure is being built.

Econergy plans to add a 68-megawatt battery energy storage system to the Oradea site. The system will make the project more valuable by storing excess power, helping balance the grid, and optimizing electricity sales. Phoenix Holdings partnered with Econergy on the project and has invested more than 225 million euros in renewable projects in Romania and Poland.

Eyal Podhorzer, CEO of Econergy, said: ""This achievement underscores our ability to deliver large-scale renewable projects while advancing our strategy of integrating storage solutions to maximize value for our stakeholders.""

Solar farms like Oradea are part of a wider trend reshaping energy worldwide. Similar projects in community solar and rooftop solar are giving people more ways to save money and contribute to a cleaner environment.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can bring your cost of energy down to at or near $0. EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

Going solar also makes using other money-saving electric appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper to run. Mitsubishi can help consumers find the right affordable heat pump for their home.

Other projects are reshaping energy in similar ways. In Minnesota, Xcel Energy is turning a former coal plant site into the Sherco solar and storage facility, set to become the largest in the Upper Midwest by 2026.

In California, Avangrid's Camino Solar will power about 14,000 homes, while Lehigh University in Pennsylvania has added a solar thermal concentrator to supply clean energy on campus and support student research.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uHLpGGOWAO5epECJqkGIWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/513981ea74abfa3e59299b6a309d92be,N,,2025-09-13 13:59:58.005212

This flies in the face of the EPA's core mission—to protect the environment and public health.""
""The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available,"" he noted.","Citing US President Donald Trump's anti-climate executive actions, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Friday unveiled a proposal to end a program that requires power plants, refineries, landfills, and more to report their emissions.

While Zeldin claimed that ""the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" experts and climate advocates emphasized the importance of the data collection, which began in 2010.

""President Trump promised Americans would have the cleanest air on Earth, but once again, Trump's EPA is taking actions that move us further from that goal,"" Joseph Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, said in a statement from the Environmental Protection Network, a group for former agency staff.

""Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,"" he explained.

As The New York Times reported:

For the past 15 years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has collected data from about 8,000 of the country's largest industrial facilities. That information has helped guide numerous decisions on federal policy and has been shared with the United Nations, which has required developed countries to submit tallies of their emissions.

In addition, private companies often rely on the program's data to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut emissions are working. And communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.

""By hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health,"" Goffman said. ""It's a further addition to the deliberate blockade against future action on climate change—and yet another example of the administration putting polluters before people's health.""

Sierra Club's director of climate policy and advocacy, Patrick Drupp, stressed Friday that ""EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data.""

""The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA's latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people,"" he added. ""The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

Margie Alt, director of the Climate Action Campaign, similarly said that ""the Trump administration's latest pro-polluter move to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is just another brazen step in their Polluters First agenda.""

Responding to the administration's claim that the proposal would save businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs, Alt said that ""under the guise of saving Americans money, this is an attempt on the part of Trump, Lee Zeldin, and their polluter buddies to hide the ball and avoid responsibility for the deadly, dangerous, and expensive pollution they produce.""

""If they succeed, the nation's biggest polluters will spew climate-wrecking pollution without accountability,"" she warned. ""The idea that tracking pollution does 'nothing to improve air quality' is absurd,"" she added. ""If you don't measure it, you can't manage it. Hiding information and allowing fossil fuel companies to avoid accountability are the true goals of this rule.""

BlueGreen Alliance executive director Jason Walsh declared that ""the Trump administration continues to prove it does not care about the American people and their basic right to breathe clean air. This flies in the face of the EPA's core mission—to protect the environment and public health.""

""The proposal is wildly unpopular with even industry groups speaking against it because they know the value of having this emissions data available,"" he noted. ""Everybody in this country deserves to know the air quality in their community and how their lives can be affected when they live near high-emitting facilities.""

“Knowledge is power and—in this case—health,"" he concluded. ""The administration shouldn't be keeping people in the dark about the air they and their neighbors are breathing.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56530290&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C407%2C0%2C407,N,,2025-09-13 12:02:49.834565

The disbanding was first reported by CNN and now NPR has confirmed that Wright wrote a letter on September 3rd to the five hand-picked members of the group, thanking them for their service.

The decision to disband the CWG came as a hearing was held this week in a lawsuit that the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists had filed against the Trump administration. As NPR reported previously, the suit alleges that Energy Secretary Chris Wright ""quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change"" to compile the government's climate report and violated the law by creating the report in secret with authors ""of only one point of view.""

Wright wrote in the letter that the purpose of the group and its report was ""to catalyze scientific and public debate"" and that the result ""exceeded my expectations."" Wright concluded that with that goal met the CWG could now be dissolved.

The CWG consisted of four scientists and one economist who have all questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses huge threats to people and ecosystems and who sometimes framed global warming as beneficial.

The report was drafted to support a Trump administration effort to stop regulating climate pollution. The DOE report was cited multiple times by the Environmental Protection Agency in its recent proposal to roll back what's known as the endangerment finding, which is the basis for federal rules regulating climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry.

""The Climate Working Group was convened in secrecy, and it created a clandestine report – in brazen violation of federal law – that is being used to weaken protections against the climate pollution that makes life less safe and less affordable for all Americans,"" Erin Murphy, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a statement.

The environmental groups want a court to throw out the CWG report, but at a conference in Belgium Friday, Wright praised the document for prompting ""open, back and forth dialogue.""

""That's what we want is to bring people that have different perspectives or disagree to dialogue together and argue it out,"" Wright told the crowd.

For all but a small segment of scientists, the debate Wright wants to prompt has already been settled.

Andrew Dessler, professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, coordinated the response from climate experts. He says unlike the DOE report, climate reports from groups such as the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change feature the work of hundreds of global scientists and require multiple rounds of peer review.

""When well-established scientific conclusions are challenged by arguments that ignore or contradict decades of solid evidence, these debates don't advance our understanding,"" Dessler wrote to NPR in a statement. ""Instead, they can muddy the waters and distract from more productive scientific inquiry.""

Dessler says the CWG report mimics the doubt-sowing strategy the tobacco industry used to prevent regulation of its harmful products.

While the Energy Department's CWG is now disbanded, the case continues over whether its report will be included in EPA's decision on regulating climate pollution. The judge has scheduled a hearing on September 23rd for the Trump administration's motion to dismiss part of the case.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

""We're going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,"" said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. ""Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.""

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs—likely for the biggest power users—to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast—twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data—and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

""Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,"" said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation's largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

""This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM's footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,"" the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a ""bring your own generation"" requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

""And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?"" Silverman said. ""Or is there a better way to do it?""

Although the time has passed for newly contracted solar energy systems to be fully installed by 2025, there are still multiple ways to maximize savings and reduce home energy costs through Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg before this fall’s enrollment deadline for the program.

Launched this summer by a local partnership consisting of the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, the Town of Davidson, and Centralina Regional Council, the limited-time campaign offers benefits uniquely geared to making renewable energy for homes, businesses and nonprofits more affordable locally.

Among the multiple reasons going solar via Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg can provide savings and resiliency:

Group Discount of up to 20%: Group-purchasing discounts have already reached a new Second Tier of progressively lower pricing.

Free and Trusted Evaluations: Those who sign up without obligation by Oct. 31 get a no-cost custom proposal as well as qualify for group discount pricing. All evaluations include projected bill savings over the next 25 years and financial analyses that include payback times and return on investment.

System-Size Discounts: Additional discounts are available for larger system sizes of up to 30 cents per watt.

Community Support: Via Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, property owners are not “going it alone.” Campaign organizers bring over a decade of solar experience to help ensure projects meet expectations.

Duke PowerPair Program: Offering up to $9,000 for qualifying solar and battery systems for a limited time. Additional incentives from Duke are also projected to be at capacity within the next 30 days.

Duke Bridge Rate: A hybrid net metering rate plan will be available only through 2027.

Under the Solarize model, which has been successfully offered through governmental involvement in other North Carolina communities this decade, the more property owners who buy together, the greater the savings for everyone.

As a community-based group-purchasing program, Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg utilizes a “tiered” pricing structure. The more participants who buy a system, the lower the price for all. Those who act early may be eligible to receive a rebate from Renu Energy Solutions (the locally headquartered installer selected through vetting) at the end of the campaign. This structure makes the final price per watt the same for every buyer.

So far, more than 225 property owners have signed up to receive a solar energy system proposal through the campaign. Participants who signed contracts to make a purchase have already combined to buy 244.8 kW in system power, which equals 507,952 lbs. of CO2 avoided locally.

Batteries have also been added by many of these homeowners to complement their new systems. A total of 364.5 kWh in battery storage has been produced through the campaign.

The overall no-obligation signup deadline for Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg remains Oct. 31. Following this, the deadline for residential contracts to be signed is Dec. 31, 2025. (Property owners considering a system for their business or nonprofit organization through the program have later deadlines due to the time needed to consider a larger-scale system.)",https://mecktimes.com/files/2023/08/meckfavicon.webp,N,,2025-09-13 11:02:40.074774

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Weber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

A deal is shrouded in secrecy

In Indiana, Google took a voluntary route.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

First launched in 2002, the Sierra Denali redefined expectations for full-size pickups. With a 6.0-liter Vortec V8 engine, opulent leather interior, woodgrain accents, and the groundbreaking Quadrasteer four-wheel steering, it proved that trucks could deliver both muscle and refinement. The example used for comparison, preserved at the GM Heritage Center, remains a pristine reminder of the nameplate’s original promise.

Fast-forward to 2026, and the Sierra EV Denali carries that legacy into the electric age. Equipped with up to 760 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque in Max Power mode, the truck boasts a GM-estimated 478-mile driving range on a full charge. Advanced features like 4-Wheel Steer with CrabWalk, Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance, and cutting-edge infotainment mark a new era of capability and convenience.

“The influence of the original Denali pickup is immediately visible in the 2026 model,” noted GM News editor Bob Sorokanich. “Where the vintage truck offered Quadrasteer for nimble handling, today’s Sierra EV Denali takes it further with CrabWalk and autonomy-ready technology.”

The side-by-side test drive, led by GM’s Shad Balch, underscored just how far Denali luxury has come—from pioneering V8-powered toughness to all-electric sophistication designed for modern drivers.

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the SPEED Act proposes significant changes to NEPA’s key provisions.
He also pointed to actions by the Trump and Biden administrations that leveraged the existing permitting process to favor certain types of energy projects.
“One top-line message against the SPEED Act is that it’s a permitting process written by and for fossil fuel polluters and extractive industries,” Golden said.
On his first day in office, Trump issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this summer underscored deep partisan divides on energy and the environment, with critics decrying it as a handout to fossil fuel interests while President Donald Trump’s supporters heralded it for securing America’s “energy dominance.”

Given the tumult over the bill’s passage, one could be forgiven for assuming that congressional Democrats would balk at working with their Republican colleagues on the GOP’s upcoming priorities.

But that’s exactly what some legislators—and key voices in the energy industry—are trying to do following the summer recess.

Their focus in the coming weeks is permitting reform, a variety of proposals to speed up the process of approving and building major infrastructure and energy projects across the nation, such as wind and solar farms, power transmission lines and fossil fuel pipelines.

The process for those approvals can stretch on for years, significantly delaying the rollout of new energy projects. According to a 2024 fact sheet from the American Clean Power Association (ACP), it currently takes an average of 4.5 years for an energy project to get the required permits needed to build, and 7.5 years for a transmission project.

Those delays impact green energy and fossil fuel industries alike, according to Xan Fishman, vice president of the Energy Program at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

“The process is neither good for businesses in the economy, nor is it good for the environment, because in order to achieve good environmental outcomes, we actually do need to build,” Fishman said.

Frank Maisano, senior principal at the lobbying firm Bracewell, echoed that sentiment.

“Whether it’s a gas pipeline, whether it’s a natural gas combined cycle plant, whether it’s a transmission line, whether it’s a solar or a wind project, it’s absurd that you should have to spend that long trying to get a permit so that you can produce power for people at a time when we need every electron we can find or get,” Maisano said.

Now, as permitting reform comes back on the agenda, an alliance of strange bedfellows is pushing more lawmakers to tackle the issue.

When Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and then-Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.) introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act in 2024, both ACP and the American Petroleum Institute (API)—trade associations for the renewable industry and oil and gas industry, respectively—endorsed the bill as a welcome step toward meeting the growing demand for electricity and strengthening American energy security.

That bill never received a floor vote in the Senate, but there now appears to be renewed interest from the energy sector and legislators to try again.

The most significant bipartisan effort currently before Congress is the SPEED Act, introduced by Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and committee member Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine).

The bill would make significant changes to how the federal government conducts environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

That 1970 law has been described as the bedrock of environmental law. It requires federal agencies to review and disclose the environmental impacts of major projects before permitting or funding them, providing both the government and the public the chance to examine the knock-on effects those projects could have.

According to an issue brief from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the SPEED Act proposes significant changes to NEPA’s key provisions. Among those measures, the bill limits what projects would be subject to NEPA review and the scope of those reviews; raises the bar for courts to overturn the decisions of federal agencies overseeing those reviews; and establishes a 150-day deadline to sue federal agencies over their permitting decisions—a drastic reduction from the current 6-year statute of limitations.

In a committee hearing for the bill on Wednesday, Westerman said the changes the bill proposes would bring needed reform and certainty to the permitting process. He also pointed to actions by the Trump and Biden administrations that leveraged the existing permitting process to favor certain types of energy projects.

The Trump administration has taken steps to streamline permitting for fossil fuel projects in recent months, while introducing obstacles for the siting and permitting of renewable energy projects.

Under the Biden administration, the opposite was true—officials introduced rules meant to speed up the process for renewables while adding additional hurdles for projects expected to harm the climate.

“This is an opportunity for Congress to exert their Article One authority and to create a system that doesn’t change when an administration changes,” Westerman said. “A system that’s fair, a system that allows access for all projects, and a system that’s blind to the project that is being proposed.”

Golden emphasized that improvements to NEPA would benefit all forms of energy development, including renewables.

“One top-line message against the SPEED Act is that it’s a permitting process written by and for fossil fuel polluters and extractive industries,” Golden said. “This ignores the reality that wind, solar and other clean energy projects face significant delays because of NEPA litigation.

“These problems with NEPA can cut both ways, and so too should be the solutions.”

But while that message resonated with Republicans and some Democrats in the hearing, other members—including Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.)—cast doubt on whether the benefits of any permitting reform bill, even a technology-neutral one, would be felt equally across the energy sector.

“I am personally deeply skeptical that we can negotiate in good faith right now to try to accelerate permitting of any kind, while there is an ongoing bad faith attack against solar and wind,” Levin said during the hearing.

That sentiment was echoed by more of Levin’s colleagues, including Rep. Emily Randall (D-Wash.), Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-Md.), and Rep. Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), all of whom referenced the administration’s attacks on renewables as obstacles to their support for the bill.

On his first day in office, Trump issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration has also taken the unusual move to issue stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already fully permitted and under construction.

To some critics such as Marlyn Twitchell, senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center, those moves could mean that fossil fuel interests disproportionately benefit from a streamlined permitting process the SPEED Act would create, while renewables see few tangible benefits.

“Given the administration’s war on renewable energy projects, this bill would do little but SPEED the climate crisis and the fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and oppressive heat that have already killed so many Americans and so severely damaged our homes, public lands, and economy,” Twitchell said in a Wednesday press release.

Other environmental groups have also voiced their opposition to the bill, arguing that the act’s provisions don’t address the primary drivers of permitting delays.

“Often missing in the conversation around NEPA is the empirical research that’s been done, and there’s a lot of that out there,” said Jarryd Page, a staff attorney at the Environmental Law Institute.

That research points to resource constraints as one of the biggest roadblocks, Page said—like not having enough staff to conduct the environmental reviews, or staff lacking adequate experience and technical know-how.

Stephen Schima, senior legislative counsel at environmental law nonprofit Earthjustice, said existing legislation from the past several years had already begun to address those needs.

“We had the Inflation Reduction Act—for the first time in history, Congress actually funded the agencies themselves to the tune of a billion dollars to actually do these reviews [and] do them more quickly,” Schima said. “They made statutory changes in the Fiscal Responsibility Act that established deadlines for environmental assessments, environmental impact statements.”

However, he said that recent actions by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans threatened to undo that progress by cutting the federal workforce and clawing back the additional resources that had been provided.

“There’s been this litany of changes, and what we’ve seen on the Republican side … in the passage of [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] is revoking that funding, rescinding the funding that was in the IRA that was actually leading to results,” Schima said.

“What we’ve seen … is a decimation of the staff and capacity at the federal agencies themselves. We need to get the staff back. We need people in the federal government to be doing these reviews and to help shepherd projects through the permitting process.”

Inside Climate News asked Westerman on Wednesday whether he would consider incorporating additional funding and staffing for federal agencies to conduct environmental reviews as part of the SPEED Act.

Westerman suggested that technological advances might allow agencies to make further cuts, instead.

“I’m having people from AI companies tell me we can cut down NEPA permitting just using AI,” he said. “So technology may get us to the point where we don’t even need as many people.”

Even if Westerman and Golden’s bill fails to garner enough support, the appetite for a bipartisan deal on permitting is unlikely to end there.

Turn Forward, a nonprofit advocating for offshore wind energy, hasn’t taken a public stance on the SPEED Act and said that achieving a bipartisan solution on permitting reform is “going to be a lift,” but executive director Hillary Bright said that she was “optimistic” about the odds of success.

And in the Senate, Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) and Ranking Member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) are in the early stages of discussing another possible bipartisan bill, according to a staffer familiar with the matter.

The staffer said that those efforts won’t be able to move forward without the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but news of the collaboration prompted a positive response from key industry voices.

“It doesn’t surprise me at all,” said Maisano.

“If there’s a guy who … can rally climate activists, that can bring people together and work with the Shelley Moore Capitos and the Lisa Murkowskis of the world … I would never put it past Senator Whitehouse to be in that position to be a broker of hard issues and complex issues to make solutions possible.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2193737930-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 06:58:17.759309

""If we can't say what a facility is doing, we can't hold that facility accountable,"" she added, warning that the lack of verifiable emissions data would undermine action at local, state, national, and international levels.
""These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting obligations, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies' climate disclosures in the absence of industry-wide methodologies.""","The United States moved on Friday to dismantle a ""burdensome"" federal programme that tracks greenhouse gas emissions across the US economy, the latest step by President Donald Trump's administration to undercut efforts against climate change.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), launched in 2010, covers more than 8,000 facilities that together account for 85-90 percent of the country's planet-warming pollution.

The programme requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty, which allows officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Experts say the reporting holds companies publicly accountable for their emissions. Since the GHGRP began, the US industry has collectively reported a 20 percent drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

Trump, who received hundreds of millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry during his 2024 election campaign, has heavily promoted new oil, gas and coal extraction while moving to suppress competition from solar and wind.

""Alongside President Trump, EPA continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American Dream,"" Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in announcing the decision, which will undergo a public comment period before being finalised.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.""

A move that could 'blind Americans' to risks of pollution

Although the programme was established through an act of Congress, the EPA argued it is not legally obliged to continue collecting the data, with the sole exception of methane emissions.

But experts say dropping the requirement, as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in US history, risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere would make it tougher to fight climate change.

A climate law passed in 2022 under former Democratic president Joe Biden established a methane fee on oil and gas operations, but Republicans' recently enacted ""Big Beautiful Bill"" requires such reporting only from 2034. Accordingly, the EPA under Zeldin says it will suspend all data collection until then.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan ""yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

""Again and again, this administration is trying to hide the data to hide the harms,"" Julie McNamara of the Union of Concerned Scientists told AFP.

""If we can't say what a facility is doing, we can't hold that facility accountable,"" she added, warning that the lack of verifiable emissions data would undermine action at local, state, national, and international levels.

Democrats had anticipated the move after they obtained documents in the spring that indicated the change was planned.

""For the past 15 years, the GHGRP has collected facility-level emissions data from over 8,000 facilities, supplying vital information to policymakers, scientists, investors, and the public,"" Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said in May.

""These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting obligations, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies' climate disclosures in the absence of industry-wide methodologies.""

He added that the data had allowed US industry to market itself as cleaner than foreign competitors, and ending the programme would hand an advantage to China.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.

If you can't afford to make larger upgrades like this or if you live in a state that isn't currently distributing IRA funds, you can still take advantage of other solutions, like plug-in induction burners, which start at around $50. Portable induction burners are also a great solution for renters.

Several state-based rebate programs are available as well. For instance, North Carolina and Georgia residents can take advantage of their states' rebate programs right now, while Tennessee, Florida, and South Carolina are in the process of launching their programs, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

""If you've been considering an energy upgrade — whether it's installing an induction cooktop or an entire solar system — don't wait,"" the organization urges.

“We’ve invented a new carbon molecule that will extend the life of the battery by 30%,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the University of Texas at Austin’s Energy Symposium on Friday. It’s a “revolutionary step change in battery performance.”

The invention is being tested by several EV manufacturers, Woods said. Used on the anode side of the battery, the synthetic graphite allows for faster charging, a longer lifespan and longer range for electric vehicles. Exxon this week announced the acquisition of several production assets from Chicago-based Superior Graphite, which will enable the company to scale-up manufacturing, with a goal of commercial production by 2029.

The Texas oil giant doesn’t intend to become a battery maker but it plans to use its refineries, chemical plants and laboratories to produce some of the materials to be used in the energy transition. It also has plans to extract lithium, a major battery component.

“We don’t do wind and solar, we have no issues with wind and solar, but we don’t have capability in that space,” Woods said. “But we do have capability of transforming molecules and there are enormous opportunities in that space to use hydrogen and carbon molecules to meet the growing demand.”

Exxon has long been a player in the vehicle-battery space. The company invented the lithium-ion battery in the 1970s and created the plastic film for the first rechargeable version in 1991. Almost two decades ago, Exxon created a new type of material used to separate battery components.

While Exxon is moving ahead with its battery-material business, the outlook for hydrogen, another targeted growth area, is looking more challenged. The company has warned it may delay a low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, due to a lack of interest from customers.

The shortening of the timeframe available to claim hydrogen tax credits under President Donald Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill may also slow market development, Woods said.

“Our big concern today around low-carbon hydrogen is whether there’s enough time within that bill to incentivize the development of the market,” Woods said.

A viable hydrogen industry based on market forces is essential to supporting multi-billion dollar investments, he said.

“We can’t do it on charity.”

Why It Matters

China has become the undisputed leader in green tech manufacturing and exports, dominating sectors from electric vehicles to solar panels and battery storage.

It has done so through aggressive state-driven industrial policy, massive public spending—totaling $625 billion last year, or nearly one-third of global clean energy investment—and by harnessing its integrated, domestic supply chains in a broader push to reduce reliance on oil imports and claim a lead in emerging technologies.

Newsweek reached out to China's National Energy Administration via email with a request for comment.

What To Know

Fossil fuel consumption in China has effectively plateaued since 2021, both in overall energy use and electricity generation, according to a report by U.K.-based think tank Ember.

Eighty-four percent of the increase in electricity demand last year was met by clean energy sources, including wind, solar and nuclear, per the report.

Wind and solar are leading the surge, with China generating 18 percent of its electricity from those sources in 2024—double the share from 2020, Ember said.

In the first six months of 2025, wind output rose 16 percent over the same period last year, while solar generation soared by 43 percent. Combined output from wind and solar hit 2,073 terawatt-hours by June, surpassing China's hydropower, nuclear and bioenergy output for the first time.

Fossil fuel use for direct end uses—like transportation, heating and industrial combustion—has stalled at just under 150 exajoules since 2018.

China has added 267.53 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first half of 2025 alone—nearly triple the rest of the world combined, according to Ember.

What People Are Saying

Jonas Nahm, assistant professor for energy, resources and environment at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, wrote on X: ""As the U.S. withdraws from green tech industries and pressures allies to follow suit, China is stepping in to power the developing world's energy transition. The scale is staggering.""

Guo Jiakun, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said at a June news conference: ""This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement. China is always a staunch doer and important contributor to global green development. Working toward peaking carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality is our solemn commitment to the international community.""

Nicholas Janzen is policy and partnerships director at Maine Conservation Voters. Francis Eanes is executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council.

Just a short two years ago, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) proved that tackling climate change and growing the economy are not mutually exclusive. The law unleashed a clean energy boom nationwide, creating thousands of good-paying union jobs, lowering household energy costs, and giving communities the tools to protect themselves from extreme weather.

In Maine, the impact was clear. We’ve surpassed our ambitious heat pump goals and are weatherizing our homes, small businesses are using solar, and we started laying the groundwork for pioneering offshore wind projects that could power our state for decades.

Now, Congress is working to undo that progress. On July 4, lawmakers passed, and President Donald Trump signed, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” More like the “Big Ugly Bill” to us. Instead of lowering costs like clean energy does, this bill drives them up. It’s nothing more than a Republican rate hike on everyday people.

This legislation guts the very programs that made the IRA such a success. The result will be higher home energy bills, lost jobs, and weaker competitiveness for Maine businesses, all while handing out tax breaks to billionaires and polluting oil and gas companies.

The bill phases out wind and solar tax credits unless projects break ground immediately, eliminates incentives for new and used electric vehicles, and ends funding for home energy upgrades, including rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation, all by the end of 2025. By slashing the very incentives that have fueled clean energy growth, it threatens to stall projects, kill jobs, and drive up energy costs for Mainers.

While the IRA fueled innovation, kept energy dollars in-state, and created family-sustaining work, the Big Ugly Bill forces families to pay more while padding the profits of the wealthiest corporations. One builds us up, the other drags us down.

Many solar projects — including a 140-megawatt array in Hartland — have already been put on hold. Union electricians are seeing hours dry up. Maine is projected to lose 1,600 clean energy jobs, and households could pay $80 more per year by 2035.

All of this comes on top of recent electricity rate hikes, driven primarily by the costs of recovering from severe winter storms intensified by climate change.

Yet our organizations know that Maine has always led and will continue to lead on climate. Even as federal policy falters, during the most recent state legislative session we strengthened emergency planning, funded climate adaptation projects, and strengthened clean electricity goals that keep energy dollars local, create union jobs, and help households save. With a new cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources, Maine is building the capacity to guide a clean energy future efficiently and effectively.

But while Maine acts, federal policy is moving in the wrong direction. Many Mainers knew the Big Ugly Bill was bad long before it passed. Dozens of organizations, businesses, labor unions, and community leaders successfully advocated to Maine’s congressional delegation, urging them to reject these clean energy rollbacks.

And while it wasn’t enough to prevent passage, Maine’s entire federal delegation heeded that call and voted against the legislation.

Even as the Big Ugly Bill drives up costs, cuts jobs, and stalls critical clean energy projects, Maine must continue to act on its own to mitigate the damage. By continuing to invest in renewable energy, strengthen climate adaptation, and support families and workers, the state can and will keep moving forward.

Two years after the Inflation Reduction Act showed what’s possible, Maine has proven that fighting climate change, creating good jobs, and saving families money can go hand in hand.

We know we can’t do it all on our own. Federal partnership is essential, but by pressing ahead, staying bold, and keeping communities at the center of our work, Maine can continue to lead.

The Big Ugly Bill is a rate hike on everyday people. Maine’s path is clear: We lead, we build, and we keep costs down for families.",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Untitled-design-47.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-13 04:57:50.590670

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech’s data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won’t be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That’s because grids can’t keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas’ has emerged from the nation’s biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there’s a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn’t anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM’s just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That’s caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM’s legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it’s too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won’t lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

Last month, the electric utility, Indiana & Michigan Power, and the tech giant filed a power-supply contract with Indiana regulators for a proposed $2 billion data center planned in Fort Wayne in which Google agreed to reduce electricity use there when the grid is stressed. The data center would, it said, reduce electricity use by delaying non-urgent tasks to when the electric grid is under less stress.

However, important details are being kept from the public and Ben Inskeep of the Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer advocacy group, said that leaves it unclear how valuable the arrangement really is, if at all.

A new way of thinking about electricity

To an extent, bumping big users off the grid during high-demand periods presents a new approach to electricity.

It could save money for regular ratepayers, since power is most expensive during peak usage periods.

Abe Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said that data centers can and do use all the electricity they want on most days.

But taking data centers off the grid for those handful of hours during the most extreme heat or cold would mean not having to spend billions of dollars to build a bunch of power plants, he said.

“And the question is, is that worth it? Is it worth it for society to build those 10 new power plants just to serve the data centers for five hours a year?” Silverman said. “Or is there a better way to do it?”

(AP) — With the explosive growth of Big Tech's data centers threatening to overload U.S. electricity grids, policymakers are taking a hard look at a tough-love solution: bumping the energy-hungry data centers off grids during power emergencies.

Texas moved first, as state lawmakers try to protect residents in the data-center hotspot from another deadly blackout, like the winter storm in 2021 when dozens died.

Now the concept is emerging in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid and elsewhere as massive data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to grids. That has elicited pushback from data centers and Big Tech, for whom a steady power supply is vital.

Like many other states, Texas wants to attract data centers as an economic boon, but it faces the challenge of meeting the huge volumes of electricity the centers demand. Lawmakers there passed a bill in June that, among other things, orders up standards for power emergencies when utilities must disconnect big electric users.

That, in theory, would save enough electricity to avoid a broad blackout on the handful of days during the year when it is hottest or coldest and power consumption pushes grids to their limits or beyond.

Texas was first, but it won't be the last, analysts say, now that the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.

“We’re going to see that kind of thing pop up everywhere,” said Michael Webber, a University of Texas engineering professor who specializes in energy. “Data center flexibility will be expected, required, encouraged, mandated, whatever it is.”

Data centers are threatening grids

That's because grids can't keep up with the fast-growing number of data center projects unfolding in Texas and perhaps 20 other states as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Grid operators in Texas, the Great Plains states and the mid-Atlantic region have produced eye-popping projections showing that electricity demand in the coming years will spike, largely due to data centers.

A proposal similar to Texas' has emerged from the nation's biggest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, which runs the mid-Atlantic grid that serves 65 million people and data-center hotspots in Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

The CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, which operates the grid that serves 18 million people primarily in Kansas, Oklahoma and other Great Plains states, said it has no choice but to expand power-reduction programs — likely for the biggest power users — to meet growing demand.

The proposals are cropping up at a time when electricity bills nationally are rising fast — twice the rate of inflation, according to federal data — and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech.

Analysts say power plant construction cannot keep up with the growth of data center demand, and that something must change.

“Data center load has the potential to overwhelm the grid, and I think it is on its way to doing that,” said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid.

Data centers might have to adjust

Big Tech is trying to make their data centers more energy efficient. They are also installing backup generators, typically fueled by diesel, to ensure an uninterrupted power supply if there's a power outage.

Data center operators, however, say they hadn't anticipated needing that backup power supply to help grid operators meet demand and are closely watching how utility regulators in Texas write the regulations.

The Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech companies and data center developers, wants the standards to be flexible, since some data centers may not be able to switch to backup power as easily or as quickly as others.

The grid operator also should balance that system with financial rewards for data centers that voluntarily shut down during emergencies, said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition.

Nation’s largest grid operator has a proposal

PJM's just-released proposal revolves around a concept in which proposed data centers may not be guaranteed to receive electricity during a power emergency.

That's caused a stir among power plant owners and the tech industry.

Many questioned PJM's legal authority to enforce it or warned of destabilizing energy markets and states scaring off investors and developers with uncertainty and risk.

“This is particularly concerning given that states within PJM’s footprint actively compete with other U.S. regions for data center and digital infrastructure investment,” the Digital Power Network, a group of Bitcoin miners and data center developers, said in written comments to PJM.

The governors of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland said they worried that it's too unpredictable to provide a permanent solution and that it should at least be accompanied by incentives for data centers to build new power sources and voluntarily reduce electricity use.

Others, including consumer advocates, warned that it won't lower electric bills and that PJM should instead pursue a “bring your own generation” requirement for data centers to, in essence, build their own power source.

Coal-fired power plant reconversion plans

The collaboration will focus on conversion of coal-fired plants to natural gas-fired generation facilities. This solution, which acts as a “crucial bridge” in the energy transition, offers a fast and economically viable response, something that renewables alone cannot yet match in terms of speed of implementation.

The rise of AI and Big Data has created a demand for power not seen in nearly two decades. Data center developers and hyperscalers need immediate, reliable and affordable power solutions. This is where the combined expertise of B&W and Denham comes into play.

“Power response time is a key factor for data center developers,” explained Justin DeAngelis, Global Head of Sustainable Infrastructure at Denham Capital. “This collaboration is a differentiating tool that will allow us to quickly meet the needs of the market.” DeAngelis added that Denham will not only invest substantially in these projects, but will also soon launch a portfolio company dedicated entirely to these solutions.

For its part, B&W brings a wealth of industry knowledge to the table. With nearly 160 years of experience, the company is an expert in converting coal-fired power plants to natural gas. Kenneth Young, president and CEO of B&W, highlighted his company’s unique ability to plan and execute complex projects, combining proven technologies with innovations to meet market demand.

The new action plan, grounded in the nation’s dual carbon goals, aims to grow the national new energy storage fleet to 180 GW by 2027.
Officials from the National Energy Administration emphasized that energy storage is now essential for stabilizing the power system and meeting growing electricity demands.
Earlier this year, China scrapped a national energy storage mandate – a policy that had previously driven as much as 75% of the country’s storage deployment.
Key measures include: Promoting the joint participation of “new energy + energy storage” in electricity market transactions as a single bidding entity.","China aims to add more than 100 GW of new energy storage (primarily battery storage, excluding pumped hydro) by 2027, according to a new action plan presented by authorities on Friday.

The “Special Action Plan for Large-Scale Construction of New Energy Storage (2025-2027)” released by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the National Energy Administration (NEA) outlines a roadmap to scale up energy storage to support the country’s rapidly expanding renewable energy capacity. The plan is expected to drive CNY 250 billion yuan (approximately $35 billion) in sector investment over three years.

China has already outpaced its previous targets. The country reached its 2025 goal of 30 GW two years early and saw explosive growth in 2024 alone, adding 37 GW / 91 GWh of new energy storage – more than doubling total capacity year-on-year. As of June 2025, China’s new energy storage fleet had surpassed 100 GW, overtaking the pumped hydro additions for the first time, according to data from the China Energy Storage Alliance (CNESA).

The new action plan, grounded in the nation’s dual carbon goals, aims to grow the national new energy storage fleet to 180 GW by 2027. It responds to the urgent need for flexible energy regulation amid rapid renewable energy expansion. Officials from the National Energy Administration emphasized that energy storage is now essential for stabilizing the power system and meeting growing electricity demands.

The plan also comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, China scrapped a national energy storage mandate – a policy that had previously driven as much as 75% of the country’s storage deployment. Introduced in 2022, the mandate required most new solar and wind projects to include co-located storage. Over 20 provinces implemented their own mandates, with some increasing their required storage ratios from 10% to as high as 20%.

The new plan envisages a more comprehensive and market-oriented approch to scaling up new energy storage. The plan outlines strategies for expanding application scenarios and improving the utilization efficiency of storage systems. It also aims to promote application of innovative projects and strengthen the development of a comprehensive standardization system.

Finally, the plan seeks to imrpove market mechanisms for the new energy storage by promoting their participation in the wholesale and anciliary service markets and accelerating the development of a dedicated pricing mechanism.

Application scenarios and market mechanisms

The Action Plan considers the needs of building a new power system and focuses on three main areas: the power supply side, the grid side, and other emerging application scenarios.

On the power supply side, the focus is on large-scale base energy storage, integration with new energy sources, and support for coal-fired power plants. These measures aim to improve the ability of coal plants to adjust output and enhance the overall grid integration of renewable energy.

On the grid side, the emphasis is on deploying storage at key grid nodes and within distribution networks. The plan encourages the development of energy storage facilities that can serve as alternatives to traditional grid infrastructure, as well as broader use of grid-based storage solutions.

For other applications, the plan targets fast-growing areas such as industrial parks, data centers, distributed solar systems, and telecom base stations. Innovative storage models will be promoted to improve energy efficiency and support stable power supply in these scenarios.

To support the integration of new energy storage into a unified national electricity market, the Action Plan calls for accelerating the development of market mechanisms. Key measures include:

Promoting the joint participation of “new energy + energy storage” in electricity market transactions as a single bidding entity.

Encouraging regions to develop auxiliary services – such as ramping and inertia support – based on local power system needs.

Improving capacity pricing mechanisms to better reflect the value of regulatory resources like energy storage.

In addition, the Plan urges all regions to speed up the development of medium- and long-term electricity markets as well as spot markets. It also calls for market price formation mechanisms to ensure that the pricing of energy storage charging and discharging is fair and market-driven.

Looking ahead, the NEA will guide provincial and regional energy authorities to follow national planning guidelines, accurately assess their local regulatory capacity needs, and clearly define the scale and layout of new energy storage and other flexibility resources.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/China.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 02:58:34.418558

California accounts for 857 EV tax credit claims (new and used) per 100,000 returns — far above the U.S. average of 320.","The federal electric vehicle tax credit, designed to encourage EV purchases by making them more affordable, is set to expire Sept. 30. While it was initially due to expire in 2032, its brief run helped new-car buyers save $3.3 billion in tax year 2023 alone.

A recent analysis by LendingTree looked at where consumers will miss out the most when the credit ends.

In tax year 2023, Americans filed 487,990 returns claiming the new EV tax credit, totaling $3.3 billion, and 28,180 for the preowned EV credit, totaling another $95.6 million. The average credit was $6,709 for new EVs, which are eligible for up to $7,500, and $3,392 for used EVs, eligible for up to $4,000.

Based on results from tax year 2023, California stands to take the biggest hit when the credit ends.

LendingTree analysts predict Californians could miss out on an estimated $1.1 billion in EV tax credits in the tax year following the end of the credits. That includes credits for new and used EVs. Californians submitted 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit in tax year 2023, or 32.2% of U.S. claims. For used EV credits, California also led, accounting for 23.2% of U.S. claims.

California accounts for 857 EV tax credit claims (new and used) per 100,000 returns — far above the U.S. average of 320.

Behind California, Texans could lose an estimated $272.7 million in potential savings, and Floridians stand to lose $201.4 million. Texas and Florida were also next in claims at a far lower 38,870 and 30,090.

Washington (571) and New Jersey (506) also have high per-capita claim rates. Conversely, Mississippi (44), North Dakota (51) and Louisiana (57) have the fewest claims compared to the number of individual tax returns.

Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst, said those credits are big, especially when considering how expensive vehicles are today.

“That these credits could often be taken at the point of sale makes them even more significant,” he said. “It’s one thing to have to wait until the following spring to get a rebate with your tax refund. It’s something else to be able to knock thousands of dollars off the price of a vehicle from the start. I have no doubt that those credits inspired people who may not otherwise have considered an electric vehicle to at least think about them.”

Schulz said the end of the credits means “an awful lot of potential buying power will go away for consumers.”

However, while the federal EV tax credit is phasing out, many states offer substantial incentives for EVs, including the top-ranking California and Texas.

Nationwide, only 1.7% of light-duty vehicles registered in 2023 were electric — an increase from 1.2% in 2022. California leads again, with EVs comprising 4.5% of registered vehicles. The District of Columbia (3.8%) and Hawaii (3.0%) follow. Meanwhile, just 0.2% of light-duty vehicles in Mississippi and North Dakota are electric.

New EV sales totaled 310,839 in Q2 2025, a 6.3% decrease from Q2 2024. The top three EVs sold in Q2 2025 were the Tesla Model Y (86,120), Tesla Model 3 (48,803) and Chevrolet Equinox EV (17,420). However, year-to-date Q1 and Q2 sales reached 607,089 — up 1.5% from the same period last year.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2024/EV_sales_full.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 09:58:51.137194

I’m also a sea kayak instructor and during the Camp Fire, I was in South Carolina for a training.
I have triplet daughters who were attending Butte College at the time, and they needed to be evacuated.
That’s why I thought we need a little bit of a buffer in Paradise and some protection around the community.
But in so many places, these events are foreseeable; we’re just not wired to think about them or prepare for them.","In order to better understand how communities can build back smarter after — or, ideally, before — a catastrophic fire, I spoke with Efseaff about his work in Paradise and how other communities might be able to replicate it. Our conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Do you live in Paradise? Were you there during the Camp Fire?

I actually live in Chico. We’ve lived here since the mid-‘90s, but I have a long connection to Paradise; I’ve worked for the district since 2017. I’m also a sea kayak instructor and during the Camp Fire, I was in South Carolina for a training. I was away from the phone until I got back at the end of the day and saw it blowing up with everything.

I have triplet daughters who were attending Butte College at the time, and they needed to be evacuated. There was a lot of uncertainty that day. But it gave me some perspective, because I couldn’t get back for two days. It gave me a chance to think, “Okay, what’s our response going to be?” Looking two days out, it was like: That would have been payroll, let’s get people together, and then let’s figure out what we’re going to do two weeks and two months from now.

It also got my mind thinking about what we would have done going backwards. If you’d had two weeks to prepare, you would have gotten your go-bag together, you’d have come up with your evacuation route — that type of thing. But when you run the movie backwards on what you would have done differently if you had two years or two decades, it would include prepping the landscape, making some safer community defensible space. That’s what got me started.

Was it your idea to buy up the high-risk properties in the burn scar?

I would say I adapted it. Everyone wants to say it was their idea, but I’ll tell you where it came from: Pre-fire, the thinking was that it would make sense for the town to have a perimeter trail from a recreation standpoint. But I was also trying to pitch it as a good idea from a fuel standpoint, so that if there was a wildfire, you could respond to it. Certainly, the idea took on a whole other dimension after the Camp Fire.

I’m a restoration ecologist, so I’ve done a lot of river floodplain work. There are a lot of analogies there. The trend has been to give nature a little bit more room: You’re not going to stop a flood, but you can minimize damage to human infrastructure. Putting levees too close to the river makes them more prone to failing and puts people at risk — but if you can set the levee back a little bit, it gives the flood waters room to go through. That’s why I thought we need a little bit of a buffer in Paradise and some protection around the community. We need a transition between an area that is going to burn, and that we can let burn, but not in a way that is catastrophic.

How hard has it been to find willing sellers? Do most people in the area want to rebuild — or need to because of their mortgages?

Ironically, the biggest challenge for us is finding adequate funding. A lot of the property we have so far has been donated to us. It’s probably upwards of — oh, let’s see, at least half a dozen properties have been donated, probably close to 200 acres at this point.

We are applying for some federal grants right now, and we’ll see how that goes. What’s evolved quite a bit on this in recent years, though, is that — because we’ve done some modeling — instead of thinking of the buffer as areas that are managed uniformly around the community, we’re much more strategic. These fire events are wind-driven, and there are only a couple of directions where the wind blows sufficiently long enough and powerful enough for the other conditions to fall into play. That’s not to say other events couldn’t happen, but we’re going after the most likely events that would cause catastrophic fires, and that would be from the Diablo winds, or north winds, that come through our area. That was what happened in the Camp Fire scenario, and another one our models caught what sure looked a lot like the [2024] Park Fire.

One thing that I want to make clear is that some people think, “Oh, this is a fire break. It’s devoid of vegetation.” No, what we’re talking about is a well-managed habitat. These are shaded fuel breaks. You maintain the big trees, you get rid of the ladder fuels, and you get rid of the dead wood that’s on the ground. We have good examples with our partners, like the Butte Fire Safe Council, on how this works, and it looks like it helped protect the community of Cohasset during the Park Fire. They did some work on some strips there, and the fire essentially dropped to the ground before it came to Paradise Lake. You didn’t have an aerial tanker dropping retardant, you didn’t have a $2-million-per-day fire crew out there doing work. It was modest work done early and in the right place that actually changed the behavior of the fire.

Tell me a little more about the modeling you’ve been doing.

We looked at fire pathways with a group called XyloPlan out of the Bay Area. The concept is that you simulate a series of ignitions with certain wind conditions, terrain, and vegetation. The model looked very much like a Camp Fire scenario; it followed the same pathway, going towards the community in a little gulch that channeled high winds. You need to interrupt that pathway — and that doesn’t necessarily mean creating an area devoid of vegetation, but if you have these areas where the fire behavior changes and drops down to the ground, then it slows the travel. I found this hard to believe, but in the modeling results, in a scenario like the Camp Fire, it could buy you up to eight hours. With modern California firefighting, you could empty out the community in a systematic way in that time. You could have a vigorous fire response. You could have aircraft potentially ready. It’s a game-changing situation, rather than the 30 minutes Paradise had when the Camp Fire started.

How does this work when you’re dealing with private property owners, though? How do you convince them to move or donate their land?

We’re a Park and Recreation District so we don’t have regulatory authority. We are just trying to run with a good idea with the properties that we have so far — those from willing donors mostly, but there have been a couple of sales. If we’re unable to get federal funding or state support, though, I ultimately think this idea will still have to be here — whether it’s five, 10, 15, or 50 years from now. We have to manage this area in a comprehensive way.

Private property rights are very important, and we don’t want to impinge on that. And yet, what a person does on their property has a huge impact on the 30,000 people who may be downwind of them. It’s an unusual situation: In a hurricane, if you have a hurricane-rated roof and your neighbor doesn’t, and theirs blows off, you feel sorry for your neighbor but it’s probably not going to harm your property much. In a wildfire, what your neighbor has done with the wood, or how they treat vegetation, has a significant impact on your home and whether your family is going to survive. It’s a fundamentally different kind of event than some of the other disasters we look at.

Do you have any advice for community leaders who might want to consider creating buffer zones or something similar to what you’re doing in Paradise?

Start today. You have to think about these things with some urgency, but they’re not something people think about until it happens. Paradise, for many decades, did not have a single escaped wildfire make it into the community. Then, overnight, the community is essentially wiped out. But in so many places, these events are foreseeable; we’re just not wired to think about them or prepare for them.

Buffers around communities make a lot of sense, even from a road network standpoint. Even from a trash pickup standpoint. You don’t think about this, but if your community is really strung out, making it a little more thoughtfully laid out also makes it more economically viable to provide services to people. Some things we look for now are long roads that don’t have any connections — that were one-way in and no way out. I don’t think [the traffic jams and deaths in] Paradise would have happened with what we know now, but I kind of think [authorities] did know better beforehand. It just wasn’t economically viable at the time; they didn’t think it was a big deal, but they built the roads anyway. We can be doing a lot of things smarter.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTU5Nzc1MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjUyMTE1MX0.Piwo1sxLWeFjt2lU_w_AuaKaAsX979GO1ZwGOvbfUKQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-13 00:58:16.863297

Coal Power Declines In China China often draws criticism for its embrace of coal-fired generating stations, and it is true that so far this century, it has built more of them and consumed more coal than any other nation.
In its concluding paragraph, Ember wrote, “The scale, pace, and depth of China’s transition raises questions about the future of fossil fuel production globally.
China has been the main ‘swing state’ for global fossil fuel demand for a decade.
“Its energy related fossil fuel consumption is likely to begin falling soon due to the twin trends of clean generation and end-use electrification, and made-in-China electro-technologies are displacing fossil energy across the world.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

In a report released on September 9, 2025, Ember said: “China’s surge in renewables and whole economy electrification is rapidly reshaping energy choices for the rest of the world, creating the conditions for a decline in global fossil fuel use.” Put another way, China is now the global leader in transitioning away from burning fossil fuels, and making the US mania for dirty fuels that waste three quarters of their available energy look sillier every day.

In the foreword to the report, Ember wrote: “The world stands at a pivotal moment. Climate change, energy security, and economic development are no longer separate challenges. Increasingly, they are interwoven — and so too must be our response. For too long, emerging economies have faced what seemed like a stark trade-off between growth and sustainability. As this report highlights, China’s green ascent challenges that assumption.

“Through scale, innovation and long-term planning, China is demonstrating that decarbonization can go hand in hand with industrial upgrading, job creation, and improved quality of life. These lessons carry significance not only for China, but for the broader region — especially Southeast Asia, where energy demand is rising and development needs remain pressing.”

Let’s unpack that a bit, shall we? In the US, the belief among the fossil fuel ideologues who have now captured the government is that renewable energy simply cannot be the basis of a robust economy because, as they tell us all the time, the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow. They refuse to acknowledge that energy storage technology is now so advanced that renewables absolutely can supply reliable, dispatchable electricity to homes and businesses. What China is doing gives the lie to all that fossil fuel twaddle.

Coal Power Declines In China

China often draws criticism for its embrace of coal-fired generating stations, and it is true that so far this century, it has built more of them and consumed more coal than any other nation. But the difference between China and the US is that it has always viewed coal as a means to an end — the creation of a modern manufacturing economy — not as an end in itself.

In fact, according to Bloomberg, China’s increase in coal power peaked in 2021 and fell significantly in 2022. Then it ticked up again in 2023, but is down by 2 percent so far this year.

Ember says China invested a staggering $625 billion in renewable energy in 2024 — nearly a third of all clean energy funding in the entire world. “China’s surge in renewables and whole-economy electrification is rapidly reshaping energy choices for the rest of the world, creating the conditions for a decline in global fossil fuel use,” Ember said. If current trends hold, “it’s likely that the world’s fossil fuel demand will be in structural decline by 2030.”

An Economic Restructuring

“China has embarked on this transition for a variety of reasons. Interviews with experts conducted for this report reveal that within China there is a realization that the old development paradigm centered on fossil fuels has run its course, and is not fit for 21st century realities. The government’s aim to establish an ‘ecological civilization,’ which simultaneously delivers on economic, social and environmental goals, is the response, embedded in the Constitution since 2018,” Ember said in its report.

“The clean energy transition is constraining China’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, reducing energy costs, stimulating growth and jobs and creating export markets. In 2024, investment and production in clean energy contributed 13.6 trillion RMB ($1.9 trillion) to the national economy — a sum equivalent to about one-tenth of China’s GDP, or the total GDP of Australia — and the sector is growing three times faster than the Chinese economy overall. The depth of buy-in within business is reflected in research, development, and innovation — Chinese companies now account for about 75% of global patent applications in clean energy technology, up from just 5% in 2000.

“These investments in the clean energy future are driving dramatic cost reductions across the world in key technologies such as wind turbines, solar panels, storage batteries and electric vehicles. The benefits are increasingly being felt in emerging markets, many of which are overtaking OECD countries in wind and solar generation share and in electrification.”

China was responsible for most of the global growth in fossil fuel use for a decade, but that is no longer the case, Ember said. In its view, “the implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see,” as demand for fossil fuels falls.

As China Goes, So Goes The World

That last part is prescient. My colleague Michael Barnard this week explored the Canadian government’s decision to prioritize LNG exports from its West Coast terminals. The US is also dumping billions of dollars into building new LNG terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. But Barnard sees trouble ahead for both. In 2025, China and India signaled that LNG will not be central to their futures.

“India is showing that renewables will crowd gas out of the generation mix. China is diversifying away from LNG with massive renewables, transmission and storage, domestic production and Russian pipelines. These shifts matter because together the two countries represent the largest block of potential demand growth. If they are going in reverse, the market outlook for LNG becomes far weaker,” he wrote.

That parallels what the Ember report said. In its concluding paragraph, Ember wrote, “The scale, pace, and depth of China’s transition raises questions about the future of fossil fuel production globally. China has been the main ‘swing state’ for global fossil fuel demand for a decade.

“Its energy related fossil fuel consumption is likely to begin falling soon due to the twin trends of clean generation and end-use electrification, and made-in-China electro-technologies are displacing fossil energy across the world. The implications for governments basing their economic growth plans on exporting coal, oil and gas are plain to see.”

Cutting fossil fuel use is necessary to reducing carbon emissions and avoiding the worst consequences of a hotter planet, Bloomberg said. But the path to net zero has been complicated by various factors — from indifference and even hostility to the energy transition in some countries like the US, to concerns over the costs of its implementation in others. That has put a huge onus on the world’s biggest polluter — China — to prove to the world that clean energy is the most logical and most effective path forward not only for China but for other nations as well.

“China is disproving the notion that green goals and economic growth are at odds, according to the report,” Bloomberg said. “Instead, it has taken a path that has allowed the two to reinforce each other and create ‘self-sustaining momentum.'”

Disrupting Self-Sustaining Momentum

The fossil fuel industry established “self-sustaining momentum” decades ago, and it is the fear that anything different will send the whole world economy into a tailspin that makes people afraid to transition away from it. If China can show that clean energy and economic growth can be partners, then that fear will disappear. Once that happens, the changeover could happen swiftly.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DALL·E-2025-02-20-09.11.24-A-panoramic-image-of-a-map-of-China-covered-in-solar-panels-wind-turbines-and-transmission-lines-depicted-in-the-style-of-an-ancient-Chinese-paint-800x457.png,N,,2025-09-13 03:57:48.119301

The report highlights the remarkable progress Morocco has made in recent years in terms of clean energy transition. It describes the country’s solar plant as a “world-class utility-scale solar complex” and an example of how Africa can attract private capital to power its clean energy transition.

The NOOR Complex is one of the largest concentrated solar power plants in the world. With a total capacity of 582 megawatts, it combines concentrated solar power (510 MW) and photovoltaic technologies (72 MW). Its ability to store energy in molten salt allows Morocco to produce electricity even after sunset, which helps the country meet peak demand.

The report explains that the project was made possible through a public-private partnership between Morocco’s Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN) and a consortium led by the company ACWA Power

International financial institutions, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank, provided concessional loans that lowered the project’s costs by up to 25%.

According to the report, “NOOR’s success demonstrates that for pioneering, capital-intensive technologies like CSP, a cohesive national vision can be effective at mitigating project risk and scaling infrastructure.”

Since its launch, NOOR has had a strong impact on Morocco’s energy sector. It provides electricity to more than 1.1 million people and accounts for around 5% of the country’s power supply.

It also reduces Morocco’s reliance on imported energy, a key issue for a nation that used to import over 97% of its energy. In addition, the project offsets about 690,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. The project also created thousands of jobs during construction and spurred new training programs and infrastructure in the Ouarzazate region.

However, the report notes some challenges, especially water use in the arid area where the complex is built. Later phases of the project adopted dry cooling technology to reduce this problem.

The NOOR Complex is central to Morocco’s long-term energy ambitions. The country aims to produce 52% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030, and solar energy plays a major role in that plan.

The report, jointly produced by Enzi Ijayo Africa Initiative (EIAI) and Africa Climate Insights (ACI), also places Morocco’s achievement in a wider African context. Despite holding 60% of the world’s best solar resources, Africa added less than 1% of global renewable capacity in 2024.

Financing is the biggest obstacle for the continent. “Africa must triple its annual growth rate to meet the Nairobi Declaration goal,” the report warns, referring to the 2023 pledge by African leaders to increase renewable energy capacity from 56 GW in 2022 to 300 GW by 2030.

If successful, this transition could transform the continent’s economy.

The Ontario government says it will contribute $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund to help fast-track construction.
Early this year, German tech giant Siemens announced a $150-million EV battery research hub in Ontario.
Sheldon Williamson, a professor at Ontario Tech University who focuses on EV battery systems, said the refinery is a strategically important step.
“Building North America’s first battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery on Ontario soil fills a clear gap in the battery supply chain,” he said.","Ontario is backing a $100-million investment to build North America’s first battery-grade cobalt refinery, aimed at supporting the country’s electric vehicle production at a time when the industry is struggling with slowing sales and a deepening trade war with the US.

Led by Toronto-based Electra Battery Materials, the plan is to build the refinery in Temiskaming Shores about 250 kilometres northeast of Sudbury.

The Ontario government says it will contribute $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund to help fast-track construction. Once completed, the facility would produce 6,500 tonnes of cobalt sulphate a year — enough to support production of up to one million EVs.

Electra CEO Trent Mell said the project is essential to reducing reliance on offshore suppliers, particularly China, which currently refines more than 90 per cent of the world’s cobalt. It will also help safeguard economic and energy security, and ensure Canada plays a leading role in the global energy transition, he added.

The province says, once completed, the facility would produce 6,500 tonnes of cobalt sulphate a year — enough to support production of up to one million EVs.

EV market under pressure

Canada’s $100 billion EV-sector development strategy faces turbulence. Sales growth has slowed, federal EV mandates are being revised and auto-sector investments are under strain from US tariffs. Earlier this year, Swedish battery-maker Northvolt collapsed, underscoring risks in the sector.

Both Ontario and Ottawa have pledged billions to secure critical mineral projects as a counter to US trade threats, arguing it will create jobs and strengthen economic sovereignty.

The province has promised $500 million for mineral processing, while Ottawa has invested $3.8 billion in exploration, refining and recycling. Early this year, German tech giant Siemens announced a $150-million EV battery research hub in Ontario.

Still, a report from the Canadian Climate Institute warned Canada could lose out on a $12 billion-a-year critical minerals market by 2040 without at least $30 billion in new mining investment. Global demand for copper, nickel, lithium, graphite, cobalt and rare earths is expected to hit $770 billion by that year.

Experts welcomed the cobalt announcement but raised concerns about execution and market realities.

Ian London, executive director of the Canadian Critical Minerals and Materials Alliance, an industry advocacy group, said the project sounds positive but questioned whether there are buyers lined up given the struggling EV market. “Where is the customer? Who has committed to buying the cobalt and at what price?” he asked. “Otherwise, this feels like a supply-push model rather than demand-pull. You can say the refinery will support EV battery plants, but unless Volkswagen or another automaker is lined up, there’s no customer.”

London said $100 million is likely not enough to build a refinery of this scale and Ontario’s $17.5-million contribution is only a term sheet — a non-binding agreement that sets out intentions but does not guarantee funding. He cautioned while the plan sounds positive, the real question is whether the plant will actually be built.

He added the refinery could make sense if Ontario secured markets abroad, such as European battery plants, which would reduce dependence on US buyers.

London also stressed that critical mineral investments should be tied to real industrial demand. He pointed to the federal government’s “nation-building” projects, such as high-speed rail, nuclear power and energy infrastructure, that will require large amounts of copper, steel and aluminum, as areas where investment may be more urgently needed.

A recent report from the Financial Accountability Office warns Ontario’s auto industry, a key pillar of the province’s economy, could lose thousands of jobs this year because of the US trade war. The sector makes up $36 billion of Ontario’s $220.5 billion in exports, with 85 per cent of goods headed to the US and most of the 1.54 million vehicles built last year sold to American consumers.

Sheldon Williamson, a professor at Ontario Tech University who focuses on EV battery systems, said the refinery is a strategically important step. The project could strengthen Ontario’s role in the global EV supply chain by making the province more attractive to battery-makers, recycling plants and automakers looking for reliable local suppliers.

Williamson says most cobalt refining currently takes place in Asia, mainly China, leaving North American supply chains exposed to trade risks. “Building North America’s first battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery on Ontario soil fills a clear gap in the battery supply chain,” he said.

The project shows Ontario is serious about building a domestic battery supply chain, but its success will depend on customers, partnerships and how fast the EV market evolves, he added.

The proposed rule would require that only the oil and natural gas industry continue to report GHG emissions, as this is specifically required by the Clean Air Act (PDF).
“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution,” Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, says in a statement.
The chemical industry emitted 181.2 million tCO2e, and the oil and natural gas industry emitted 322 million tCO2e.
According to the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, the total US greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 5,960.80 million tCO2e, which was 11.25% of the global total.","In another strike against US climate policy, Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin announced on Friday afternoon that the agency is proposing to end the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP).

This program, stemming from a law signed in 2007 by President George W. Bush, requires that all facilities in the US annually report greenhouse gas emissions above a certain threshold so that scientists and lawmakers have accurate data with which to predict future climate and enact appropriate policy to mitigate any dangers. If the EPA’s proposal is finalized, the agency says, “most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 [sic] injection sites” would no longer have to report their emissions.

The proposed rule would require that only the oil and natural gas industry continue to report GHG emissions, as this is specifically required by the Clean Air Act (PDF). However, as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill signed by President Donald J. Trump in July, the Clean Air Act now says that the oil and natural gas industry doesn’t need to report its emissions again until 2034.

Criticisms of EPA’s move came quickly.

“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution,” Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA, says in a statement. “Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

Goffman further notes that “by hiding this information from the public, Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality, and public health.”

According to the EPA’s news release, the GHGRP “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.” Zeldin says in the release that the program doesn’t improve air quality and “is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

The proposal is part of a wider effort by the agency to roll back regulations and spending on climate change and other areas.

By 2030, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that direct health costs from climate change will be between $2 billion and $4 billion per year. In addition, the WHO projects that climate change will cause about 250,000 additional deaths a year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.

According to the publicly available GHGRP data for 2023, the latest available, power plants in the US emitted 1,471.5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). The chemical industry emitted 181.2 million tCO2e, and the oil and natural gas industry emitted 322 million tCO2e. According to the European Commission’s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, the total US greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 were 5,960.80 million tCO2e, which was 11.25% of the global total.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-GHG-reporting-rollback---172737:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-12 22:01:10.997352

Entergy expects its electric sales will grow by about 13% per year for the next few years, driven by data centers coming online in its service territory, Drew Marsh, Entergy chairman and CEO, said Wednesday at an energy forum hosted by Tulane University.

In recent years, Entergy’s industrial sales have spurred roughly 5% annual sales growth, according to Marsh. Ultimately, New Orleans-based Entergy’s sales could triple or quadruple by 2050, he said.

Meta plans to build a data center complex in Louisiana’s Richland Parish with an initial 2 GW of “compute,” which doesn’t include electricity for cooling and ancillary services, Marsh said. Entergy has agreed to build roughly 2 GW of gas-fired, combined cycle generation to serve the data center’s initial phase, at a cost of about $2 billion, he noted.

Under the plan approved Aug. 20 by the Louisiana Public Service Commission, Entergy Louisiana will build two generating in Richland Parish, which the company expects will be online in late 2028. A third facility will be built at the utility’s Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, which Entergy expects will be operating a year later. The power plants will total 2,262 MW and will be built to handle future carbon capture and sequestration technology, according to the company.

Meta’s data center complext could be expanded to 5 GW and Entergy may add up to 2 GW of solar to support it, Marsh said.

Meta will pay for the new generation and transmission upgrades needed to bring the data center online as well as its ongoing share of Entergy’s costs, according to Marsh. Those upgrades will boost grid reliability in the area, he said.

Entergy’s utilities serve about 3 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

The additional gas-fired generation for the Meta data center project will make it challenging for Entergy to meet its goal of cutting its carbon dioxide emissions by 50% below 2000 levels by 2030, Marsh said. However, Marsh expects Entergy will be able to meet its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050, noting that Meta has agreed to explore carbon capture and storage options for the gas-fired capacity.

Entergy is “very focused” on sustainability, “but by and large, the world is not focused on sustainability — less so today than it was two years ago, to be sure,” Marsh said.

Marsh said he expects interest in sustainability will swing back around. “These are things that cycle around, and certainly younger generations have a very different expectation of what that should be, and I expect that over time, sustainability is going to move up in that pecking order,” Marsh said.

Currently, Entergy’s top priority is electricity affordability, followed closely by reliability and resilience, according to Marsh.

The United States needs more nuclear power plants and must retain its existing ones, said Marsh, who noted he is chair of the Nuclear Energy Institute.

However, building nuclear power plants is “a little bit of a challenge,” Marsh said, noting that the two new units at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia cost about $30 billion, up from an $8 billion initial estimate, and were about seven years behind schedule. “That’s not ideal.”

While nuclear safety is “very important,” it’s been “overdone” by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to Marsh. As a result, using equipment that meets certain NRC standards can be extremely expensive and time consuming to acquire, he said.

Marsh called for “a more truly risk-based standard that is not so stringent.”

Marsh said he supports emerging small modular reactor technology, but that its name may lead to misconceptions. “They’re not necessarily small and they’re not necessarily modular,” he said.

Ontario Power Generation’s SMR project, for example, required a 10-story hole in the ground, according to Marsh.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/BGm0Jg5e2WJ7M-pff5qSvRT_CqOJRjVlZiPK40HwSWs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY3JlZW5zaG90XzE2Mi5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-09-12 22:01:16.380428

Challenge: Merging modern sustainability on a heritage site Castle & Key saw the bottling expansion as the perfect opportunity to operate more sustainably.
The distillery partnered with local installer Solar Energy Solutions (SES) to engineer and construct the on-site system.
This in-house approach ensured accountability and coordination across the fast-moving Castle & Key build.
This case study is a collaboration among Castle & Key, SES and Weidmuller USA.","With roots dating back to the early 1800s by one of the forefathers of the American spirits industry, Castle & Key Distillery, located in the heart of Kentucky’s bourbon country in Frankfort, is known for more than its craft spirits.

Built in the late 1800s in a style meant to align with European architectural designs, the property features a castle, springhouse and sunken garden. It has been painstakingly restored to honor that heritage, and, since its reopening in 2018, distillery leaders have earned a reputation for forward-looking, innovative and modern sustainability practices.

As it was planning to construct a new bottling operation adjacent to its warehouse in nearby Versailles, the distillery decided to invest strategically in a large-scale solar PV project. In addition to reducing Castle & Key’s carbon footprint and lower long-term energy costs, solar power would set a precedent for renewable energy adoption in Kentucky’s spirits industry. But integrating PV services into a historic property presented unique hurdles, from aesthetic considerations and preservation requirements to the practical realities of power generation for a production facility.

The journey from concept to completion required strategic planning, close collaboration with partners and creative problem-solving. Timing was critical, as a $2 million grant from the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) would expire at year-end.

Challenge: Merging modern sustainability on a heritage site

Castle & Key saw the bottling expansion as the perfect opportunity to operate more sustainably. Currently served by Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Utilities, two utilities that rely heavily on coal and natural gas, the distillery recognized that producing its own electricity could deliver both cost stability and meaningful environmental impact.

The distillery partnered with local installer Solar Energy Solutions (SES) to engineer and construct the on-site system.

From the outset, the project faced challenges due to aggressive deadlines. The first half of the solar array needed to be installed, energized and inspected by Dec. 31, 2024, to qualify for tax credits and maximize REAP grant funding. The timeline pressure meant that delays at any stage — whether in design, component availability or utility approval — could jeopardize millions in financial incentives.

Technical hurdles also needed to be addressed. The PV system had to be carefully engineered to integrate with the distillery’s operations, then connected to the utility grid under strict safety standards — particularly given the flammable spirits stored at the site. Permission to operate could only be granted once inspectors confirmed the system met all codes. In addition, Castle & Key wanted the system to be robust enough to perform reliably for decades, which required careful attention to component durability, maintenance needs and scalability for a second construction phase.

Solution: Leveraging proven expertise and suppliers

With 20 years in the business, SES leveraged its strengths as a vertically integrated engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm to deliver a turnkey solution. This in-house approach ensured accountability and coordination across the fast-moving Castle & Key build. Rather than a closed system, the distillery opted to remain connected to utility lines, allowing it to sell excess power generated and ensure it still had power to operate during adverse weather, such as cloudy skies or snow.

A key part of the SES solution was a partnership with Weidmuller, which has supplied PV components to the international market for 15 years. The U.S. arm, Weidmuller USA located in Richmond, Virginia, was called on to meet the year-end deadline and provide the required PV DC combiner boxes that could be delivered quickly and installed without delay. Weidmuller USA ensured SES had the necessary enclosures on-site to complete wiring, connection and testing before the critical year-end energization.

These combiner boxes bundled multiple DC strings from the solar panels, protected them with integrated fuses and surge protection, and provided a single aggregated feed to the inverters. By streamlining the system design, the Weidmuller equipment not only saved time but also provided a durable solution — coupled with a five-year warranty — built to last.

SES and Weidmuller’s technical teams coordinated closely on design specifications, which included adapting the number of strings and configurations. The boxes’ modular format allowed flexibility between this initial phase and the next-stage build-out, ensuring the system could be expanded smoothly. While this initial installation did not include string monitoring, used widely in Europe and Latin America, Weidmuller offers retrofit options that can be added later if Castle & Key wants more detailed performance monitoring. Given that solar panels are exposed to extreme weather conditions over their lifetime, string monitoring is advantageous in helping to pinpoint faulty panels or malfunctioning modules.

Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which has been in place since 2009, would affect over 8,000 facilities, including power plants, electronic, chemical and mineral processing facilities and oil refineries.

The program's data are used to guide federal policy, and the data also help companies demonstrate they're hitting emissions-cutting benchmarks for the public, shareholders and investors.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in the release that the plan would save American businesses as much as $2.4 billion in regulatory costs but would still comply with the Clean Air Act. He first raised the idea of ending the reporting program in March.

""Unlike other mandatory information collections under the CAA, the GHGRP is not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment,"" Zeldin said in the release.

He said it would be ""a significant step toward streamlining operations, cutting unnecessary red tape, unleashing American energy, and advancing EPA's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

Certain fossil fuel facilities would be required to keep reporting emissions if the rule is ended, including some natural gas and offshore oil facilities, under the Inflation Reduction Act, enacted during the Biden administration. The EPA has proposed a delay of nearly a decade in implementing the data collection requirement, though, putting it off until 2034.

But environmental experts say ending the program would prevent the public from knowing how much major industrial polluters are emitting into the atmosphere.

""Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,"" said Joseph Goffman, who served as assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation during the Biden administration, in a statement.

Groffman now works with the Environmental Protection Network, a volunteer organization of former EPA employees.

Health experts are also concerned that ending the program could jeopardize public health.

""Measuring and reporting climate pollution is a critical step in reducing the deadly impacts of climate-driven extremes that cause more pollution, catastrophic weather events, health emergencies, and deaths. Ignoring this reality is a deadly choice, and not one that EPA should be making for American families,"" Will Barrett of the American Lung Association said in a statement.

GM confirmed for the Free Press that the automaker sold 12 BrightDrop vehicles to Amazon.

Amazon.com is testing General Motors' Chevrolet BrightDrop electric van, marking a significant potential client for the struggling Canadian-produced electric vans.

Amazon is testing a fleet of electric vehicles for its business, Bloomberg News first reported Sept. 12, with BrightDrop among those produced by Rivian and GM's crosstown rival Ford Motor Co.

GM confirmed for the Free Press that the automaker sold 12 BrightDrop vehicles to Amazon in 2023. Amazon reportedly promised to have 100,000 electric delivery vehicles delivering its packages within the next five years, and to reach net-zero carbon across its global operations by 2040.

“We sell Chevrolet BrightDrop vans to large global brands, rental companies and local service providers. Logistics companies often rent Chevrolet BrightDrops from our customers to meet increased, seasonal demand,” GM spokesman Sabin Blake said Sept. 12 in an emailed statement. “GM has remained committed to Chevrolet BrightDrop including an expanded dealer network, helping to increase visibility to small business customers.”

BrightDrop's commercial customers have included Walmart, Hertz, FedEx, Merchants Fleet and Verizon.

GM produces the Chevrolet BrightDrop at its CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, in Canada. Workers at CAMI Assembly are represented by Unifor Local 88.

Mike Van Boekel, the local's plant chairperson, said landing a customer like Amazon would be “great news.”

“That's a potentially big customer,” Van Boekel told the Free Press. “Those are the kinds of customers we need to attract.”

Van Boekel added that sales of BrightDrop have jumped over the past few months. About 90% of BrightDrop vans are sold in the U.S., he said.

Production shutdowns, layoffs

BrightDrop's struggles come less than a year after GM folded the commercial vans into its Chevrolet brand in a bid to boost its performance as GM tries to gain ground against competitors, including Ford and Rivian, in the electric van space.

Unifor said on April 11 that GM informed the union that CAMI Assembly would initiate temporary layoffs starting April 14 with workers returning in May for limited production. After that, production would temporarily cease with operations idling until October 2025 in order to complete retooling work to prepare the facility for production of the 2026 model year.

After production resumed, Unifor said the plant would operate on a single shift for the foreseeable future — a reduction expected to result in the indefinite layoff of nearly 500 workers.

Unifor Local 88 represents more than 1,200 workers at the CAMI Assembly Plant, where GM began BrightDrop production in early 2023.

Production of the Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans, launched in 2021, halted in April, as a glut of vehicles began piling up on both sides of the border, as the Detroit Free Press first reported in March.

GM also told the Free Press in an email on Sept. 4 that CAMI will resume BrightDrop production on Nov. 17. Battery pack production at the plant will remain paused, however, as the automaker has produced a sufficient supply to meet immediate production plans, the company also said.

The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the long-standing Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

The agency is issuing a proposed rule to rescind the program, which is now open for public comment.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” The EPA’s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said in the Friday press release. “Instead, it costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities.”

The EPA has been collecting this data since 2010; it’s used to create a national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, to inform the regulation of emissions and to ensure that the public has access to information on pollution.

Some research indicates the data reporting has also had some downstream impacts. A 2021 National Bureau of Economics Research paper found that power plants forced to report under GHGRP reduced their carbon emissions by about 7%, with greater reductions for publicly owned plants.

“Cutting the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses, and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health,” said Joseph Goffman, the former EPA assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation.

The EPA uses the data to track the country’s effort to stop using super-polluting, high-potency greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, a push Congress required the EPA to facilitate in 2021 under the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act. HFCs are used in refrigeration, air conditioning and fire suppression, and they trap thousands of times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

Without this reporting program, there will be no way for researchers, the public or the federal government to understand which facilities are creating greenhouse gases or how much an industry or company is producing. States that use the data to regulate climate emissions will also have to reevaluate how to do so, which is a reality the EPA acknowledged.

“The EPA understands that several states use the emissions estimation, reporting methodologies, and data from the GHGRP to develop or supplement state-level GHG emissions inventory programs,” the agency wrote.

The agency goes on to suggest that it’s difficult to quantify the costs to states of removing the program and that state governments can get the information themselves using “state authorities to support state programs.”

The EPA also acknowledged that the GHGRP has been used to track the congressionally mandated reduction of HFCs. But the agency appeared to completely dismiss the way that information is used.

“For gases regulated under the AIM Act, this information, if needed, could be collected as part of any program directly related to the AIM Act,” the agency wrote. There is no other information about the AIM act or any program related to it in the document.

As part of this proposed rescission of the program, EPA also proposed to completely stop collecting data from oil and gas companies about their greenhouse gas emissions, despite the fact that the collection of that information for the imposition of a fee was mandated by Congress in 2022.

Trump’s tax bill, signed into law in July, halted the implementation of that fee until 2034, which the EPA cites as the reason for ending reporting for those companies until that year, when the fee goes back into effect.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/8bfef4d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6563x3692+0+341/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F15%2Fbc%2F5123c72d4dd7978f66cbaa894eb8%2Fepa-water-signing-feb-18-25049703288485.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 19:01:08.590718

John B. Larson (CT-01) wrote to U.S.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentdemanding immediate IRS compliance with the law before homeowners face an erroneous tax increase.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit offers up to $3,200 annually for homeowners to cover efficiency upgrades. It was first enacted during the Bush Administration and expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, a law Larson helped author and pass to invest in climate action and create new incentives to lower household utility bills. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, families using the credit were able to save an average of $882(link is external) on their taxes.

“Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families,” Larson and his colleagues wrote. “If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly intended to eliminate it, they should have cited the law correctly – Congress writes laws, and sloppy drafting is no excuse for the Treasury department to substitute its policy preferences for the language of the law as enacted. We urge the IRS to affirm publicly that the credit remains available in future tax years and to reject any interpretation that would unlawfully strip households of these savings.”

Full text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Acting Commissioner and Secretary Bessent:

We write to ensure that hardworking, American families continue to receive the full benefit of Section 25C, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which remains law and in effect through December 31, 2032. As you know, this credit was enacted on a bi-partisan basis twenty years ago under the George W. Bush Administration. The credit was subsequently expanded in the Inflation Reduction Act (P.L. 117-169), which incorporated provisions of the Home Energy Savings Act, led by Ways & Means Committee Member Rep. Jimmy Gomez. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides significant relief for Americans by offering up to $3,200 annually for qualifying energy-efficient home improvements – helping households lower utility bills and reduce overall living costs.

It appears that the Internal Revenue Service is taking the position, in guidance for taxpayers on its website, that the benefits of Section 25C are no longer available to taxpayers after December 31, 2025. However, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L.119-21) did not modify the expiration date of the credit, which remains December 31, 2032.

To be clear, Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) do not have the authority to subsume or disregard this provision; the agency must follow statutory law as enacted by Congress. As Members of the Committee of jurisdiction responsible for drafting tax policy, we emphasize that Section 25C remains fully operative and that the IRS must continue to administer it as Congress intended. Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families.

Our colleagues in the Senate, responsible for drafting the enacted provision, chose to eschew consideration of P.L. 119-21 under regular order. Accordingly, its rushed, middle of the night advancement left the American public with no legislative history to determine Congressional intent regarding the enacted provision. If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly intended to eliminate it, they should have cited the law correctly – Congress writes laws, and sloppy drafting is no excuse for the Treasury department to substitute its policy preferences for the language of the law as enacted.

Thus, the law is clear: Section 25C must continue through 2032. We urge the IRS to affirm publicly that the credit remains available in future tax years and to reject any interpretation that would unlawfully strip households of these savings.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to your confirmation that Section 25C will remain in place as dictated by statute.",http://larson.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/larson.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/DSC_0309.JPG,N,,2025-09-12 20:58:16.670508

The agency said mandatory collection of GHG emissions data was unnecessary because it is “not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment”.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” said Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator.

The rule responds to a day-one executive order issued by Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to unleashing more US energy, particularly fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of major regulatory rollbacks undoing previous US efforts to combat climate crisis.

Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to repeal the “endangerment finding” that enabled the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and stationary sources.

If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites.

The Trump administration has also said it will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.

The Trump administration has also taken steps to end the collection of key environmental databases at the EPA as well as other federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and end greenhouse gas-monitoring satellites operated by Nasa.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years.

,EPA,2025-09-12 21:49:06+00:00,CityNews Halifax,The EPA wants to end a requirement that large polluters report their greenhouse gas emissions,News Staff,,,,,https://halifax.citynews.ca/2025/09/12/the-epa-wants-to-end-a-requirement-that-large-polluters-report-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.
“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.
Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution.
But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.” The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday proposed doing away with a program that has required large, mostly industrial polluters to report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions to the government.

The program requires refineries, power plants, oil wells and landfills to report their emissions without risk of penalty as officials seek to identify high-polluting facilities and develop policies to lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Experts say the reporting held the companies publicly accountable for their emissions.

Since the program began in 2009, U.S. industry has collectively reported a 20% drop in carbon emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal-fired power plants.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “burdensome” and unhelpful to improving human health and the environment.

Removing the rule would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs over 10 years while maintaining the agency’s statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act, Zeldin said. If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large industrial facilities in the United States, as well as fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide injection sites.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” Zeldin said in a statement.

“It costs American businesses and manufacturing billions of dollars, driving up the cost of living, jeopardizing our nation’s prosperity and hurting American communities,” he said. “With this proposal, we show once again that fulfilling EPA’s statutory obligations and Powering the Great American Comeback is not a binary choice.”

But experts say dropping the requirement — as Zeldin promised in March when he unleashed what he called the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history — risks a big increase in emissions, since companies would no longer be publicly accountable for what they discharge into the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.

Joseph Goffman, who led EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden, said eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program “blinds Americans to the facts about climate pollution. Without it, policymakers, businesses and communities cannot make sound decisions about how to cut emissions and protect public health.”

By hiding pollution information from the public, “Administrator Zeldin is denying Americans the ability to see the damaging results of his actions on climate pollution, air quality and public health,” Goffman said, calling the plan “yet another example of the Trump administration putting polluters before people’s health.”

David Doniger, a senior strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, called the proposal “a cynical effort to keep the American public in the dark, because if they don’t know who the polluters are, they can’t do anything to hold them responsible.”

Big polluters may want to keep their climate pollution secret, he added, but the public, states and local policymakers “have depended on this data” for more than 15 years. Public accountability and pushback from investors have led many companies to reduce their climate pollution even before EPA sets stricter standards, Doniger said.

But Zeldin said reducing the overall regulatory burden on U.S. industry will allow companies to “focus compliance expenditures on actual, tangible environmental benefits.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program covers 47 source categories and requires more than 8,000 facilities and suppliers in the U.S. to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions annually, Zeldin said.

“Following a careful review, EPA proposed that there is no requirement under (the Clean Air Act) to collect GHG emission information from businesses, nor is continuing the ongoing costly data collection useful to fulfill any of the agency’s statutory obligations,” he said.

The EPA will accept public comments on the proposal for more than six weeks after the plan is published in the Federal Register, expected in coming days.

Appalachian Power has three coal-burning power plants in West Virginia.","Public anger is growing over rising electricity prices nationwide. In West Virginia, Appalachian Power customers have been paying hundreds of millions of dollars in hidden costs.

Inflation has driven up the cost of many basic necessities: food, housing and energy.

What Appalachian Power’s 1.1 million customers may not have known is that for years, they’ve been paying an extra cost on their monthly bills. Not for more electricity. But for electricity that costs more to produce than available alternatives. And from a pair of 70-year-old coal-burning power plants outside the state, in a contract state regulators never approved.

Other states have walked away from the plants.

Michigan regulators last year denied a request to have consumers pay for losses at the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek power plants, which are part of the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, or OVEC.

“Any amount that was being paid to OVEC above market was disallowed,” said Devi Glick, an energy analyst at the research firm Synapse Energy Economics who testified in Michigan.

Ohio lawmakers earlier this year repealed a subsidy for the plants that was found to be costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars.

The OVEC plants are currently sending electricity to Appalachian Power’s customers in West Virginia and Virginia as part of a long-term power purchase agreement. Using Glick’s analysis, adapted from the Michigan case, it is costing them tens of millions of dollars a year.

Appalachian Power paid more per megawatt hour for OVEC power than it did for market-price power in six of the past seven years, the analysis shows.

Glick calculated that Appalachian Power customers have overpaid more than $328 million since 2018, using the same kind of analysis she provided to Michigan regulators.

West Virginia Public Broadcasting performed its own independent analysis using similar data, and found nearly identical results.

“It’s not serving the ratepayers’ best interests,” Glick said of OVEC. “It’s in the owners’ best interest to try to just string it along as long as possible, and as long as they’re allowed to.”

The Virginia State Corporation Commission, that state’s utility regulator, quietly approved Appalachian Power’s contract with OVEC in 2011, finding it to be in the public interest at the time.

Appalachian Power didn’t seek approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission (PSC), though its service territory overlaps both states. A West Virginia PSC spokesman declined to comment and referred questions to Appalachian Power and OVEC.

Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, is minority chairman of the House Energy and Public Works Committee. He said the OVEC contract is an example of the state’s nearly exclusive dependence on coal to generate electricity.

“I think that we need a real sober look at why West Virginia’s electric rates have gone up faster than any other state over the last 15 years,” he said. “It’s due to an overreliance on a single energy source that has become more and more expensive compared to alternatives.”

Appalachian Power asked the West Virginia PSC for a rate increase this year, but was denied amid an intense public backlash to the rising cost of power.

Hansen’s efforts to curb the growth in electricity costs have faced high hurdles in a legislature with a pro-coal Republican supermajority in both chambers.

West Virginia Public Broadcasting asked Republicans to comment for this story. None did.

Appalachian Power said the OVEC plants provide capacity and reliability to customers. Many grid experts say electricity demand will rise dramatically in the coming years due to data center demand to power artificial intelligence.

“Electricity from OVEC continues to provide a reliable baseload generation resource, at a stable cost, for our customers,” said Debra Pannell, an Appalachian Power spokeswoman. “Removing existing generation resources from the pool could drive power prices higher and decrease reliability.”

Indiana regulators accepted that position in July, when they approved costs for the OVEC plants that Michigan regulators rejected.

Still, consumer advocates say new demand can be met with natural gas, renewables and battery storage, at a lower cost. Severe winter storms in recent years have shown that coal and gas experienced some of the worst failures.

If nothing changes, the OVEC plants will remain under contract to their owners until 2040.

In Ohio, electricity customers were set to pay close to $1 billion by 2030 to subsidize the OVEC plants, until the repeal of a controversial bill earlier this year.

“We were looking at the fairness and whether it’s fair to charge consumers,” said Maureen Willis, director of Consumers Council of Ohio, which fought to scrap the subsidies. “From our perspective, it’s the investors who should bear the risk, and not the consumers.”

The OVEC plants were at the center of one of the biggest public corruption scandals in Ohio history. Key officials accepted bribes in exchange for bailing out the plants.

Ohio’s former House speaker is serving 20 years in prison as a result of his conviction in the scandal. Two former First Energy executives accused of bribing the former speaker await trial.

The state’s former top utility regulator took his own life while facing trial.

“There was just real criminal wrongdoing, people accepting really crude bribes to pass a bailout for these coal plants that were built in the 1950s,” said Tony Mendoza, a Sierra Club attorney who urged the West Virginia PSC to scrutinize the OVEC contract in 2018.

Cold War To ‘Hot Potato’

The Kyger Creek Plant in Cheshire, Ohio, and the Clifty Creek Plant in Madison, Indiana, were built to help America win the Cold War.

In 1955, they both began sending electrons to the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in southern Ohio, a federal site that enriched uranium for nuclear weapons.

After the Cold War, operations at the Portsmouth plant wound down, and the U.S. Department of Energy had no need for Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek.

OVEC’s owners, including the region’s largest electric utilities, saw them as a way to provide electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers.

The companies negotiated a contract that would remain in effect until 2040. In it, they agreed to share power produced by the plants at ratepayers’ expense without asking each state utility regulator for approval.

Appalachian Power parent company American Electric Power, First Energy, Duke Energy, and Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities use power from the plants.

AEP has the largest share of the OVEC contract, at 39%, through three affiliates: Ohio Power, Appalachian Power and Indiana-Michigan Power.

Mendoza calls it “wild” that the utilities could lock their customers into the contract for 30 years without asking every state regulator for approval.

“Virginia had a specific requirement that you can’t enter into these long term contracts without pre-approval,” he said. “All the other states should have had that.”

Over the course of a decade, OVEC spent $2 billion on air pollution upgrades on the plants, including scrubbers to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, and a system to control nitrogen oxide, which causes smog.

OVEC made a bet that it could pass along those costs to customers and still remain profitable by generating electricity.

The timing couldn’t have been worse.

Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocked an abundant supply of cheap natural gas, including in Appalachia.

Coal-burning power plants struggled to compete with the onslaught of gas, and many have retired in the past 15 years, on both sides of the Ohio River.

“If the shale boom had happened 10 years earlier, they would have retired these plants and replaced them with gas units at the site,” Mendoza said. “So what they did is they made a massive investment in coal, kind of, right at the last time period where it made sense to do that economically.”

Glick, the industry analyst, said the plants have frequently operated at a loss – costing more to produce power than they could sell it for in the market. Customers of multiple utilities in multiple states are paying for the losses.

She said with the complicated split in ownership and varying state regulations, no one company wants to stick its neck out and propose any changes to how OVEC operates – including its largest owner, AEP.

“The best analogy is hot potato,” Glick said.

Seeds Of A Scandal

On July 30, 2020, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Ohio sent out a news release that would be shocking in any state.

A federal grand jury had indicted the Ohio Speaker of the House, Larry Householder, in a $61 million bribery scheme involving two First Energy nuclear power plants and the OVEC coal plants.

Householder wasn’t the only one in trouble. Mathew Borges, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party was also indicted, as was Householder’s longtime campaign and political strategist, and two lobbyists.

In the next few years, the scandal widened. Sam Randazzo, the former chairman of the Public Utility Commission of Ohio, was indicted. Then Chuck Jones, the former president and CEO of First Energy, and Mike Dowling, the company’s former senior vice president.

All were alleged to have participated in a racketeering conspiracy to bail out the nuclear plants and the OVEC plants in legislation called House Bill 6.

Householder was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He has asked President Donald Trump for a pardon. Borges was sentenced to five years in prison. Facing as many as 20 years in prison, Randazzo, 74, took his own life in April of last year.

Trials for Jones and Dowling start next January.

The companies themselves have also faced a reckoning for their role in the scheme.

In September 2024, First Energy agreed to a $100 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its participation in the HB 6 scandal.

In January, AEP reached an agreement with the commission to pay a civil penalty of $19 million over its role in HB 6. None of its current or former executives face charges.

In May, Ohio’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill to repeal the OVEC subsidies.

Just like in West Virginia, Ohio customers came out ahead in 2022. Russia invaded Ukraine early that year, sending the price of coal and gas worldwide skyward. It wouldn’t last, though.

“They lose money every year, except in really unusual events, like in 2022 when power prices are obscenely high,” Mendoza said of the OVEC plants. “It was hard not to make money if you are a power plant owner in 2022.”

In 2023 and 2024, it was back to business as usual for the OVEC plants, costing Appalachian Power customers more than $165 million combined.

“It’s like you’re using these antique cars to perform normal commuting and driving, and passing those costs on to the ratepayers,” Glick said. “And it’s not happening very efficiently.”

‘A Necessity Of Life’

In April, Trump signed a series of executive orders intended to boost the production and consumption of coal.

In May, the U.S. Department of Energy took the unusual step of ordering a coal plant in Michigan to stay on the grid through the summer instead of shutting down. In August, the department extended its order to November.

Trump’s moves have proved popular with lawmakers in West Virginia, whose support of coal is generally unwavering.

In August, Charlotte Lane, the chair of the West Virginia PSC and a former First Energy lobbyist, wrote to Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in support of his effort to roll back Biden-era limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.

The Biden EPA rule would require costly changes to the OVEC plants or shutting them down.

“The closing of the fossil-fuel, and particularly coal-fired generation, has already, and will continue to, severely reduce the reliability and resilience of the electric grid,” Lane wrote. “If allowed to go forward, the existing rule will cost customers and the economy billions of dollars, and threaten the health and welfare of customers for whom electricity is a necessity of life.”

Despite federal policy shifts to boost coal and throttle the development of renewables, the market trends are not likely to flip back in coal’s favor.

At its peak nearly two decades ago, coal generated half the country’s electricity. By last year, its share had fallen to 16%, pushed aside by natural gas and also wind and solar.

West Virginia is the nation’s No. 2 coal producer behind Wyoming, but it is more reliant on coal for generating electricity than any state.

Appalachian Power has three coal-burning power plants in West Virginia. Together, they can produce multiple times the electricity the OVEC plants contribute to Appalachian Power.

The Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants pay workers who mostly live in Indiana and Ohio. The property taxes they pay go to communities in those states – not West Virginia.

Hansen, the West Virginia delegate, said the state could make other choices.

“I think this issue is another example of doubling down on coal because it’s requiring ratepayers to pay for electricity generated by old, inefficient, coal-fired power plants that’s more expensive than electricity that could have been purchased off the grid,” he said.

A Missed Opportunity?

The PSC had a chance to rein in the OVEC costs in 2018, when the Sierra Club’s Mendoza challenged the expenses during an Appalachian Power fuel cost recovery case.

The Sierra Club presented evidence that Appalachian Power customers were paying tens of millions a year more than they should have for electricity from the OVEC plants. It would have been cheaper to buy electricity from PJM, the mid-Atlantic regional market that includes West Virginia and Virginia.

The Sierra Club asked the commission to disallow Appalachian Power from recovering those uneconomic costs.

In 2019, the commission declined to take any action. It hasn’t revisited the issue since and wouldn’t comment.

Mendoza said the commission expressed little interest at the time in looking at the OVEC costs, “and so we at Sierra Club have focused on other states.”

Public anger over rising electricity costs likely influenced a more recent order from the PSC. In August, it told Appalachian Power to freeze customers rates. The company had asked for a $250 million increase in base rates – nearly $24 a month for the average residential user.

The commission received more than 5,000 public comments against the proposal. School boards, county commissions and a majority of the Charleston City Council joined the chorus.

Hansen said state leaders are aware of the discontent over rising electricity costs. But, he said, their solution is to find ways to use more coal, rather than turn to cheaper sources.

“I think there were so many objections filed with the Public Service Commission that they realized they had to do something a little bit different,” he said. “But the utilities are going to continue to come back with more requests for rate increases, and they’re just following the policies that have been set by the legislature.”

Hansen and other Democrats offered a bill earlier this year that would have capped electricity rates. It never got a hearing. By contrast, Virginia lawmakers enacted a bipartisan bill this year to lower Appalachian Power bills. It was signed into law by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Hansen said he plans to reintroduce legislation that would more clearly define what it means for the PSC to serve the public’s interest. That, he said, holds the potential for keeping the PSC accountable for the decisions it makes – including its hands-off approach to the OVEC plants.

“I think we need that type of legislation for cases just like this to make sure that the commission is making decisions in the best interest of West Virginians,” he said.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_2605.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 09:58:37.393985

In its most pessimistic scenario, the Rhodium Group projected that emissions from the world's largest economy would decline slightly for the rest of the decade, then flatten out between 2030 and 2040 at just under 4.9 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The research organisation modelled low, mid, and high emissions pathways by weighing factors including economic growth, fossil fuel prices, and clean energy costs and performance.

""The first seven months of the second Trump administration and 119th Congress have seen the most abrupt shift in energy and climate policy in recent memory,"" the authors wrote in their latest annual Taking Stock report.

""After the Biden administration adopted meaningful policies to drive decarbonisation, Congress and the White House are now enacting a policy regime that is openly hostile to wind, solar, and electric vehicles and seeks to promote increased fossil fuel production and use.""

US emissions have been steadily falling since peaking in the mid-2000s at more than six billion tons, thanks to several factors.

The biggest driver has been coal's decline, replaced first by natural gas and more recently renewables. Efficiency gains in vehicles, appliances, and industry, alongside supportive policies, have also played a role.

According to the Rhodium Group, greenhouse gases are now projected to decline 26-35% by 2035 relative to 2005 levels – a ""meaningful shift"" from last year's report, which forecast a far steeper 38-56 % drop.

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has pursued an agenda centred on boosting fossil fuels and restricting renewables.

A recent tax-and-spending law passed by Republicans in Congress repealed green energy tax credits enacted under former president Joe Biden, while the administration has also been rescinding approvals for wind projects already under construction.

Renewables will continue to grow substantially through 2030 as companies claim expiring clean electricity tax credits, the report forecast, but deployment then diverged under the three different emissions scenarios.

Transportation emissions are projected to fall more modestly, by 8-20% in 2040 compared to 2024, with zero-emission vehicle sales shares rising only slightly.

Meanwhile, oil and gas production is increasingly geared toward exports.

North Carolina’s Senate race is showing early signs of what that might look like.

Michael Whatley, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, entered the race in July. He quickly became the GOP favorite to take on Democrat Roy Cooper, North Carolina’s former two-term governor. But as I report today, Whatley’s long career as an oil and gas industry lobbyist is pulling energy policy to center stage.

North Carolina is a decidedly purple state — Trump won 51 percent of the state to Kamala Harris’ 47.8 percent in 2024, and North Carolina has voted Republican in the past four presidential elections. Democrats have won all but one governor’s race since 1992, and neither party has had a lock on a Senate seat.

And it’s a state that swings in two directions on energy policy. A 2021 law requiring utilities to cut greenhouse gas emissions has been a persistent source of friction in Raleigh. In July, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed a bill from the GOP-dominated Legislature that sought to repeal part of the emissions reduction requirement. The Legislature overrode the governor’s veto.

Since taking office — with the enthusiastic support of Whatley’s leadership of the Republican Party — Trump has taken a slash-and-burn approach to clean energy and climate policy. Now, the North Carolina race offers a potential test of public sentiment as Republican budget-cutting takes hold, electricity prices rise and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases down support for wind, solar and battery projects that would have contributed to the economy.

If the Whatley-Cooper showdown becomes a referendum on Trump policies, Democrats appear poised to seize on Whatley’s role as an advocate for oil companies.

The ‘dominance’ factor

In endorsing Whatley in August, Trump said he would “Champion American Energy DOMINANCE,” while saying the candidate “delivered for North Carolina, especially after the terrible floods,” referring to the 2024 destruction from Hurricane Helene.

Democrats have been working to paint him as an oil lobbyist, Washington insider and unwavering Trump loyalist.

Whatley started lobbying for energy companies in 2005, first focusing on air pollution regulations. His later work included opposing climate change rules for power plants and cars. HBW Resources, the lobbying firm he helped launch in 2009, started and managed the Consumer Energy Alliance, which Whatley led, as well as other pro-oil groups.

His advocacy for offshore drilling, particularly off North Carolina’s Atlantic coast, may be a key point of contention in the race. Whatley lobbied for a quick resumption of offshore drilling after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and backed Trump’s 2018 proposal to open nearly all U.S. waters for potential production.

The Interior Department is working on a new five-year plan for offshore oil leasing — if the time’s right, fresh fodder for the bellwether Senate race.

Today in POLITICO Energy’s podcast: Josh Siegel breaks down how Trump’s actions against renewable energy are reverberating on Capitol Hill.

Highly paid utility executives face their customers

Customers of the utility company Xcel Energy in Minnesota are pushing back against executive pay packages following a series of electric rate increases, Jeffrey Tomich reports.

Nationally, politicians have seized upon rising electricity prices. President Donald Trump vowed during his campaign to slash electricity costs within a year. Instead, prices are going up. Across the Midwest, consumer advocates and attorneys general are pressing utility regulators to clamp down on multimillion-dollar pay packages.

In Michigan, another state where electric rates have been climbing, Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office last year called out Detroit-based utility DTE for including in rate requests more than $300,000 in costs related to leasing corporate jets.

And in Illinois, consumer advocates challenged a request by gas utility Nicor, a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., to include more than $25 million in executive incentive compensation in the rates of Chicago-area customers.

Emergency weather plan faces cuts

A National Weather Service plan to place meteorologists in emergency centers across the U.S. is on the ropes because of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the federal government, Chelsea Harvey writes.

The NWS has lost about 600 staff to layoffs and retirements since Trump implemented a hiring freeze Jan. 20. That’s left the agency scrambling to fill hundreds of vacant posts, and it’s not clear where the embedded meteorologists rank in priorities. The first full-time meteorologist was hired last November in Virginia.

While the program isn’t dead, former NWS staffers say turnover at the agency has hampered progress.

“I’m sure it’s changed,” said Brian LaMarre, a former NWS meteorologist who retired in April.

Trump, turbines and a bird obsession

Trump has railed against wind power for killing birds, among other things. But turbines are far from the biggest threat birds face, Michael Doyle reports.

“They kill all the birds,” Trump said of turbines in Miami Beach in February. He told a Michigan crowd in February 2020 that windmills are “destroying your fields. They’re destroying everything, killing all the birds.”

In fact, cats are the biggest killers of birds, responsible for an estimated average of 2.5 billion deaths a year in the United States. Collisions with turbines, meanwhile, account for an average 234,000 bird deaths a year, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. Electrical lines cause an average of 25.5 million deaths.

The global appetite for electric cars shows no signs of slowing down - in August alone, 1.7 million EVs found new homes, per research firm Rho Motion. This brings the total for the first eight month of the year to 12.5 million.

The August sales break down to 1.16 million fully battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and 570,000 plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).

The US sales data for August painted a picture of a market hitting a record high. But this jump is directly tied to a deadline, and it won't last much longer. American consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the soon-to-expire federal tax credit. This last-minute buying spree boosted short-term numbers, but analysts expect a sharp decline in sales for the final three months of the year.

Some automakers are already planning to scale back production in anticipation of this drop-off. Volkswagen is reportedly pausing production of its ID.4 electric SUV in October, and General Motors is also said to be planning EV production cuts after the tax credit expires.

The situation north of the border in Canada tells a different story about the power of government incentives - or rather the complete lack of it. Canadian EV sales have fallen by a third so far this year after the national iZEV rebate program was paused. Combined with tougher economic conditions, it is now unlikely that automakers will be able to meet the country's EV Sales Mandate for 2026.

As a result, there is a growing expectation that the government will pause the 2026 mandate for review, highlighting how dependent the transition to electric cars remains on consistent policy support. Overall, the North American market is up by a modest 6% year-to-date, mainly thanks to that temporary US sales boom.

Meanwhile, Europe's EV market is growing more consistently, driven by strict emissions legislation rather than short-term consumer credits. The market has grown by 31% so far this year, with both BEVs and PHEVs seeing nearly identical growth rates.

Germany's sales are up 45% and the United Kingdom's up 31%. Other nations are showing even more dramatic growth; sales in Spain have doubled, and Italy has seen a 41% increase. The only major market bucking the trend is France, where sales have fallen by 9% this year.

The European market is also becoming a key battleground for international brands. Chinese automaker BYD is finding success with its Seal U, which has become one of the continent's bestselling plug-in hybrids. The company is doubling down on its European expansion, releasing another model, the Seal 6 PHEV, in September.

In the United Kingdom, sales dipped in August, but this is a normal seasonal trend before new license plates are released in September, which always causes a massive sales spike. British buyers also saw two new models become eligible for a £3,750 EV grant: the Ford Puma Gen-E and the Ford E-Tourneo Courier.

In China, the world's largest market for electric cars, the numbers require a bit of context. While the market grew a healthy 25% year-to-date, year-over-year growth for July and August was relatively slow. This isn't a sign of a weakening market, but rather a reflection of an unusually strong sales period in 2024, which was fueled by a government trade-in subsidy program.

In other news from the region, industry leader BYD has reportedly trimmed its ambitious 2025 sales target from 5.5 million down to 4.6 million vehicles, though it still expects to sell nearly a million of those outside of China.",https://st.arenaev.com/news/25/09/ev-sales-go-up-globally/-1242x621/arenaev_000.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 20:58:04.418138

The Trump administration has also said it would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.
""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers, including power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and fossil fuel/industrial gas suppliers, to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually.
The carbon capture and storage industry, which is supported by the Trump administration, said the proposal will undermine an emerging technology backed by industry.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed on Friday a rule to end a mandatory program requiring 8,000 facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions - an effort the agency said was burdensome to business, but which leaves the public without transparency around the environmental impact of those sources.

The agency said mandatory collection of GHG emissions data was unnecessary because it is ""not directly related to a potential regulation and has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.""

The rule responds to a day-one executive order issued by President Donald Trump aimed at removing barriers to unleashing more U.S. energy, particularly fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of major regulatory rollbacks undoing previous U.S. efforts to combat climate change.

Earlier this summer, the EPA announced plans to repeal the ""endangerment finding"" that enabled the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and stationary sources.

If finalized, the proposal would remove reporting obligations for most large facilities, all fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites.

The Trump administration has also said it would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, which requires countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and report their progress.

""The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,"" said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The Trump administration has also taken steps to end the collection of key environmental databases at the EPA, as well as other federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and end greenhouse gas-monitoring satellites operated by NASA.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires 47 source categories covering 8,000 facilities and suppliers, including power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and fossil fuel/industrial gas suppliers, to calculate and submit their greenhouse gas emissions annually. The program also covers CO2 injection sites.

The agency will still require submission of methane emissions data for large oil and gas operations for companies subject to a waste emissions charge.

The carbon capture and storage industry, which is supported by the Trump administration, said the proposal will undermine an emerging technology backed by industry.

""This announcement from EPA will not advance carbon storage - something Administrator Zeldin has publicly supported,"" said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition. ""This proposed rule endangers millions of dollars in investments from American businesses in these technologies.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108103702-17399006312025-02-18t173452z_1472853843_rc24xcarylcg_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump-epa.jpeg?v=1739900681&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-09-12 18:02:56.840916

Leadership has shown important balance by delivering a package that will stabilize fuel prices, lower energy bills, ensure reliable clean energy and cut pollution while continuing to uplift California’s climate commitment and long-term transition to clean energy.
Finally, it will create a regionalized electricity grid that will make the best use of clean energy and guard against blackouts.","SACRAMENTO – Earlier this week, Governor Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders announced a major deal on historic climate and energy bills that will drive down electricity costs for millions of Californians, stabilize gasoline supply, and continue the state’s world-leading efforts to slash greenhouse gas emissions.

Since that announcement, environmental and energy advocates, labor, business, transit and housing advocates, wildfire survivors, local elected officials and climate leaders alike have shared their support for the bills.

Former Governor Jerry Brown: “Trump & his band of troglodytes are rooting for us to fail. We can’t let that happen. It’s time to pull together to extend our cap & invest program. This is a no brainer. We’ve done it before, let’s do it again.”

Jennifer Granholm, former U.S. Secretary of Energy: “California is keeping its foot on the accelerator toward a more affordable clean energy future, even as the Trump administration does everything possible to stomp on the brakes. This legislative session, California is poised to reauthorize the state’s landmark Cap and Invest program and pass legislation to make electricity more affordable, while ramping up family-sustaining clean energy jobs and replenishing the state’s wildfire fund. Governor Newsom and California’s legislative leaders are leading by example, and the world is watching.”

Tom Steyer, Investor and Climate Champion: “Big step forward: the cap-and-invest bill will be voted on this week. California has the chance to reaffirm its climate leadership and deliver billions in climate funding to our communities. Now we need lawmakers to finish the job.”

Katelyn Roedner Sutter, California State Director, Environmental Defense Fund: “Lawmakers must pass Assembly Bill 1207 which reauthorizes and strengthens California’s cap-and-trade program. California has proven that growing a thriving economy and taking bold climate action can go hand-in-hand. Now, it is time to build on this success. This agreement includes key reforms to bolster its power to cut climate pollution while keeping costs down for families. By aligning the future of cap and trade with the timeline of California’s ambitious emission reduction targets, California is positioned to achieve its climate goals in the most cost-effective way possible. We look forward to working with state leaders and the California Air Resources Board to ensure implementation of price ceiling changes maintains the environmental integrity of the program and balances the affordability needs of families. California is charting a roadmap for a safe and prosperous climate future and others are already following our lead. As federal leadership embraces the largest causes of climate change, California lawmakers must acknowledge if they don’t lead on climate action now, no one else will.”

Melissa Romero, Policy Advocacy Director, CA Environmental Voters: “The Legislature’s extension of cap and invest is necessary to keep California on track toward meeting its climate targets.”

Victoria Rome, California Government Affairs Director, NRDC: “Bills now in print continue California’s leadership on clean energy. While the Trump administration attacks California and undercuts jobs in wind, solar, and electric vehicles, our state leadership came together around a package of bills to lead the clean energy transition into the next decade. With AB 825’s new language, California can share clean energy resources with neighbors across the West, while keeping strong protections for state authority and consumer interests. By reauthorizing the cap and invest program, securing the wildfire fund, and shifting climate incentives from fossil fuels to electrification, California can make electricity more affordable and continue investing in programs that support community resilience. Legislators should support this package and send it to Governor Newsom’s desk right away.”

Chris Hannan, President, CA State Building and Construction Trades Council: “Through the extension of Cap-and-Invest and the dedicated high-speed rail funding secured via AB 1207 and SB 840, California is delivering the largest project labor agreement in the country, creating good union jobs for tens of thousands of Californians. Continued investment in high-speed rail goes beyond infrastructure—it’s an investment in California’s workers, our families, and our environment, reaffirming the state’s position as a leader setting the standard for the rest of the nation. We are grateful for Governor Newsom’s leadership throughout this process.”

Stephanie Wiggins, CEO, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority: “I would like to express my gratitude to Governor Newsom, Assembly Speaker Rivas, Senate President pro Tem McGuire, and the members of the Los Angeles County Legislative Delegation for advancing a comprehensive Cap-and-Invest program for the State of California. Your efforts to protect transit funding during the Cap-and-Invest negotiations will yield significant benefits in Los Angeles County. We look forward to our continued partnership as we advance our common interest to meet the State’s climate goals. Metro is delivering almost $30 billion in infrastructure in Los Angeles County that leverages billions in federal funding. A stable and robust transit investment from the State will help us to bring almost three times that investment and tens of thousand of jobs to our County over the life of the currently proposed Cap-and-Invest Program.”

California Chamber of Commerce: “California’s energy future depends on a grid that’s affordable, reliable, and clean. AB 825 is a key step toward achieving those goals, paving a practical path to participate in a broader regional power market. Those savings matter for family budgets, for small manufacturers navigating thin margins, and for the competitiveness of energy-intensive employers that anchor local economies.”

Rodney Fong, President and CEO, San Francisco Chamber of Commerce: “San Francisco businesses and families need stable energy costs and a reliable grid to thrive. This package delivers affordability and predictability while reinforcing California’s clean energy leadership. We urge the Legislature to act quickly so our communities can realize the savings and competitiveness these reforms will bring.”

Matt Peterson, President and CEO, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator: “California needs to send clear signals to the country and the world that we remain deeply committed to a clean economy and that’s exactly what the current package of energy and climate bills do. Reauthorizing cap and invest sends a clear market signal that we are committed to accelerating equitable climate innovation, creating a low carbon future, and lowering electricity costs, all crucial for our energy transition.”

Netflix, IKEA, REI Co-op, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., Ceres, Dignity Health, Anew Climate, The Climate Trust, CA Outdoor Recreation Partnership, Climate Action Reserve, and 20 other climate and business organizations: “Uncertainty about the Cap-and-Trade Program is harming California by forgoing revenues that would have otherwise been used to lower utility bills for ratepayers and directly invest into communities. We support a strengthened Cap-and-Trade Program because restored program certainty will further drive clean investments into California and uphold the state as a global economic powerhouse. Doubling down on California’s successful Cap-and-Trade Program is the smartest way to tackle the climate crisis by prioritizing cost-effective achievement of California’s climate targets, making California most affordable, and supporting California communities. The California Legislature and Governor should act as soon as possible to extend the Cap-and-Trade program this legislative session.”

Housing CA, Transform, Public Advocates, CA Housing Partnership, Move CA, SPUR, Abundant Housing LA, Greenbelt Alliance, Housing Action Coalition, Climate Action CA, San Diego Housing Commission, CA Council for Affordable Housing, Housing Accelerator Fund, The Transit Coalition, Transbay Coalition, Mercy Housing, City of Santa Cruz, YIMBY Action, and 30+ other transportation, housing, environmental, and equity organizations: “Funding affordable housing and sustainable transportation is fundamental to addressing climate change, encouraging economic prosperity for all Californians, and advancing equity. Specifically, we appreciate SB 840 for protecting key programs for affordable housing and transportation…These programs are a vital step toward addressing the needs of frontline communities who have seen very few greenhouse gas emissions reductions or air quality improvements. We also support the $250 million continuous appropriation to the State Air Resources Board for community air protection programs and recognize the need for additional investments and legislation that centers the concerns of environmental justice communities.”

CA Transit Association, CA Alliance for Jobs, CA State Council of Laborers, CA-NV Conference of Operating Engineers, League of CA Cities, CA State Association of Counties, Transportation CA, American Council of Engineering Companies of CA, CA Construction and Industrial Materials Association, Associated General Contractors of CA: “On behalf of the Climate Safe Infrastructure Coalition – a broad coalition of business, labor, local government and transit agencies – we write in support of the proposals to extend California’s Cap-and-Invest program. Given the importance of reauthorizing the Cap-and-Trade program and the progress made in advancing many of our coalition’s funding priorities, including through the maintenance of continuous appropriations for infrastructure, rail, transit, and housing programs, we support the Governor and Legislature acting this session to reauthorize the Cap-and-Trade program and adopt the Expenditure Plan.”

Kern County Board of Supervisors: “Over the past 15 years, Kern has attracted $89 billion in private energy investment by balancing clean energy leadership with locally managed, environmentally responsible permitting. SB 237 strengthens this balanced approach, supporting in-state oil production while California advances its transition to clean energy. We urge your support for SB 237 as a critical component of California’s energy strategy. This legislation will protect consumers from supply disruptions, provide investor confidence in the state’s energy sector, and ensure Kern County continues to lead with both environmental responsibility and energy reliability.”

Ventura County Supervisor Matt LaVere: “I applaud Governor Newsom and the California Legislature for working together on legislation to reduce energy costs statewide. This important work reflects a clear understanding that affordability is top of mind for families across the state, and lowering bills while accelerating the transition to clean, reliable energy is a win-win for all Californians.”

City of Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson: “As Mayor of the City of Riverside, I believe we can build cleaner communities while also saving people money. That’s why I am proud to support this bold legislative package, which will lower utility bills, strengthen grid reliability, invest in wildfire prevention, boost our local economy, and improve air quality for our residents. I urge the legislature to pass these historic measures and deliver a better quality of life for all Californians.”

City of Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts: “I’m proud that Inglewood has shown what can be accomplished when leadership is focused and determined, from building world class venues to creating jobs and opportunities for our residents. This agreement reflects that same spirit by lowering bills while boosting our economy through investments. I am proud to stand with the Governor on this effort and urge the Legislature to act so communities can feel the support of their government in this critical time”

City of Compton Mayor Emma Sharif: “In Compton we fight every day for resources that give our residents dignity and opportunity. High energy costs and unhealthy air have placed an unfair burden on families for too long. This agreement brings real relief by putting money back in people’s pockets and protecting the health of our neighborhoods. I thank Governor Newsom for prioritizing communities like ours, and I call on the Legislature to deliver this win for working families across California.”

City of Artesia Mayor Ali Taj: “Over the past year, Artesia families have shouldered significant challenges, from the stress of rising costs to the uncertainty of making ends meet. Through it all, I’ve witnessed our community show remarkable strength and unity. Our City Council has worked hard to provide support where it’s needed most, but local governments cannot address these issues alone. We need every level of government to step up and deliver for our residents. This agreement exemplifies how state officials can effectively rise to the challenge, and I extend my gratitude for their bold and committed leadership.”

City of Monterey Park Mayor Vinh T. Ngo: “I support Governor Newsom’s plan to ease everyday Californian expenses on household electricity costs, steady gas prices, while transitioning to cleaner, eco-friendly energy. Now the legislature must act expeditiously to get these bills to the Governor’s desk!”

City of South Gate Councilmember Gil Hurtado: “I’ve always pushed for solutions to help build a more resilient future for our communities. This deal is a great example of that. It shows what is possible when we put people first: lower bills, cleaner air, and more stability for working families. I encourage our legislative leaders to keep this momentum going and pass these bills for a stronger future for all Californians, including the residents in South Gate that I represent”

City of Baldwin Park Councilmember Emmanuel J. Estrada: “For working families, especially in communities like ours, energy affordability and clean air go hand in hand. I applaud Governor Newsom and legislative leaders for advancing a plan that prioritizes both economic fairness and environmental health.”

City of Moreno Valley Mayor Ulises Cabrera: “This historic legislative package shows what’s possible when state and local leaders work together. It addresses the immediate concerns of families struggling with high utility bills, while investing in long-term clean energy and air quality improvements. I urge the Legislature to pass this historic package that will ensure a brighter, cleaner, and more affordable future for all of our communities.”

City of West Hollywood Councilmember John M. Erickson: “Families across California are struggling with rising costs. This deal can help address some of those pressures while also ensuring that California continues positioning itself as the economy of the future.”

Advanced Energy United: “SB 540 is now AB 825, CA Leg, let’s get this done and pass arguably one of the most significant energy bills of the year. Passing this bill will end up saving ratepayers $1 billion per year, improve reliability, and reduce emissions.”

Alex Jackson, Director, American Clean Power-California: “This proposal clears the way to stand up energy markets that can save Californians real money. It means we can work with our neighbors to ensure the West has the affordable, reliable, clean power needed to meet surging demand. Every lawmaker who wants to alleviate California’s rising electric bills should support [AB 825] in floor votes later this week.”

Kelly Trombley, Senior Director of State Policy, Ceres: “Voting for energy affordability and the cap-and-invest program is a no-brainer for legislators wanting to support businesses in California. This package will deliver affordable clean energy, cut emissions, strengthen our economy and support bottom lines. California’s businesses need stability, predictability, and efficiency, which is why we’re asking legislators to vote ‘yes’ today.”

Meredith Alexander, California Coalition of Large Energy Users: “California has a critical choice to make. Passing a workable SB 540 this year will lower costs for ratepayers, improve grid reliability, and expand access to affordable clean energy. But if we don’t authorize market expansion this year, we risk losing these benefits as other Western states join a competing Arkansas-based market–which certainly will NOT create rules friendly to CA or Renewable Portfolio Standards. CA’s environmental and business leaders want a cooperative grid that supports us during heat waves, not to be stranded like Texas. I hope that CA’s leaders don’t fail us in the 11th hour.”

E2: “Amid federal clean energy rollbacks, California lawmakers must extend the cap-and-trade program this year to keep investing in communities, clean tech, and jobs—while advancing the state’s climate goals and leading the nation forward.”

Daniel Barad, Western States Policy Manager, Union of Concerned Scientists: “California lawmakers have the opportunity to improve the lives of their constituents in very real ways by passing the clean energy reliability and affordability package. Leadership has shown important balance by delivering a package that will stabilize fuel prices, lower energy bills, ensure reliable clean energy and cut pollution while continuing to uplift California’s climate commitment and long-term transition to clean energy. Lawmakers should pass this package to reauthorize the state’s cap and trade program, lower energy bills through affordability legislation, and ensure reliable clean energy by sharing resources with our neighbors in the West.”

Jamie Pew, Policy Advisor, NextGen: “We applaud Governor Newsom’s leadership on affordability policies that will keep energy costs under control and stay true to California’s climate commitments. Californians wanted their elected leaders to take action, and that’s exactly what this package does.”

Sam Uden, Co-founder and Managing Director, Net Zero California: “California lawmakers will vote this week on a suite of affordability, climate and grid resilience bills that are nothing short of transformative. This legislation will make the state a national leader in low-cost financing reforms that can make essential grid infrastructure more affordable – a model that can be replicated by states across the country. It will ensure polluters continue to pay their fair share for emissions, generating billions for programs that clean the air and create jobs. Finally, it will create a regionalized electricity grid that will make the best use of clean energy and guard against blackouts. This is what true leadership looks like.”

Hon. Reuven Carlyle, Founder of Earth Finance, Former WA State Senator and author of Washington State’s Climate Commitment Act: “This historic legislation sets the stage to formally link together two of the most effective and proven climate programs globally. California, Quebec and Washington are showing governments and communities around the world that a firm cap on pollution and investing in climate action, affordability and quality of life works. Cap & Invest funds clean air, clean water, reduces wildfires, restores salmon runs, provides transit, timber and agriculture community support and so much more. Our bonds in the West Coast run deep and this legislation shows that together we can continue to grow our economies with a lighter touch on the earth.”

Clayton Munnings, Executive Director, Clean and Prosperous California: “Cap-and-invest is the most affordable way to hit California’s ambitious 2030 climate target. By committing to extending the program beyond 2030, California sends an economic signal to the carbon market that our state is wide open for businesses that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The importance of this economic signal cannot be underestimated as California once again takes on the political mantle of climate leadership in the face of a federal Administration that wants the United States to backslide on clean prosperity.”

Western Freedom: “‘The Pathways Bill’ passed the California Legislature’s Senate Energy, Utilities, and Communications Committee and it did so with the broad support of a powerful coalition of advocates, industry leaders, labor organizations, and community voices behind it. This is what progress looks like when we unite to solve the real challenges that our grid is facing and envision a future with a more reliable, affordable, and resource diverse Western Interconnection.”

Dr. Kyle Meng, Professor of Economics, UC Santa Barbara: “This is the most important U.S. climate policy for the foreseeable future. These bills send a signal that California is doubling down on its climate commitments for the next two decades with a practical approach that meets both climate and affordability goals.”

Pasadena/Altadena Ivy Foundation and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, Eta Lambda Omega Chapter: “The Wildfire Fund has proven to be more than an accounting tool, it is a lifeline for victims. Without it, the burden of wildfire recovery would fall directly on survivors and on the fragile network of nonprofits and local agencies that rush to fill the gap. It ensures that compensation flows even when disasters are large, frequent, or unpredictable. Our experience with the Eaton Fire demonstrated how quickly disaster can overwhelm local response systems and how vital it is for survivors to have stable, reliable recovery resources that enable them to rebuild, children to return to their school routines, and seniors to regain a sense of home.”

Clergy Community Coalition, Neighborhood Survants, Pasadena Organizing for Progress, Love Land Community Development Corporation, Vida Mobile Clinic, and Altadena residents: “The communities of the Eaton Fire are calling for an immediate extension of the Wildfire Fund to ensure that there are sufficient resources to compensate victims of wildfires like the one our community recently endured.

As victims of a tragedy, losing our homes and more has been traumatic enough. Worrying that there will not be sufficient resources to help us recover and rebuild is unimaginable. Fire victims are weary. They want to go home. They want to know that they can build back what they had. They shouldn’t have to live under the threat of another fire and another utility bankruptcy stalling and shorting their recovery.

We urge you to extend the Wildfire Fund; don’t let history repeat itself.”

Victoria Williams, Founder, Black Education Expo: “The Wildfire Fund is critical to ensure that vulnerable families are not further harmed. Without an extension, recovery will stall, compounding the trauma and disruption caused by the fire. Families need stability to focus on rebuilding not only their homes, but also their educational futures. Our community cannot afford to be left without adequate support during this crucial time.”

Raúl Ibáñez, Program Coordinator, Community Overcoming Recidivism though Education, Pasadena City College: “Our community, which includes individuals working hard to rebuild their lives after incarceration, has now been devastated once again — this time by natural disaster. For many of our students and their families, the Eaton Fire has not only destroyed homes but also threatened the fragile progress they’ve made toward stability and reintegration. In moments like these, safety nets like the Wildfire Fund are essential. We urge you to take swift and compassionate action: extend the Wildfire Fund without delay.”",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6C94C750-0DF8-46C6-A8E3-00EA4F1B1ADD.jpeg,N,,2025-09-12 18:02:43.591379

There are three big issues with EPA’s advanced biofuel proposal: The advanced biofuel mandate is too big.
EPA overshot how much domestic advanced biofuel and advanced biofuel feedstock will be available in 2026 and 2027.
However, foreign soy that gets imported and crushed here, would get full credit under EPA’s RFS proposal.
For an administration that prioritizes American energy dominance and affordability, this RFS proposal is way out of line.","The 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency can only be met if the United States significantly INCREASES imports of foreign biofuels and feedstocks. In short, the RFS proposal is at odds with the President’s ‘energy dominance’ agenda.

There are three big issues with EPA’s advanced biofuel proposal:

The advanced biofuel mandate is too big. EPA overshot how much domestic advanced biofuel and advanced biofuel feedstock will be available in 2026 and 2027.

Here’s the backstory. EPA used old data from 2023 and 2024 — none of the available 2025 data — to arrive at the 2026-2027 RFS proposal. EPA basically just assumed the same growth trends in domestic biofuel feedstock and production from those earlier years would continue into 2026 and 2027. But things have changed, and data from this year show advanced biofuel production in the United States is declining.

The advanced biofuel mandate will require a significant uptick in imports. This ties back to the previous point. If advanced biofuel feedstock and production had kept pace with 2023 and 2024 growth trends, it MIGHT have been possible — in theory — to satisfy the full RFS advanced biofuel mandate with JUST American fuel and feedstocks.

But, as we stated above, EPA’s supply assumptions are wrong. So, the only way to meet the too-big mandate is by INCREASING the amount of advanced biofuel feedstock imported into the United States.

EPA wants to penalize advanced biofuel imports while simultaneously requiring more of them… make it make sense!

For 2026 and 2027, EPA wants to cut the RFS value of any imported biofuels and feedstocks in half, supposedly to boost demand for domestic fuels and feedstocks. But remember, the proposal itself is so big, it’s going to require more feedstock imports.

Fixing the advanced biofuel portion of the RFS doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, AFPM has given EPA a head start. EPA leaned on an S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis of 2023-2024 data to inform its proposal. AFPM commissioned the same team at S&P Global Commodity Insights to run the same analysis, just of the latest 2025 data. And if EPA simply swaps in the new analysis for its final 2026-2027 RFS, they’d trim down the advanced biofuel portion of the mandate to reflect actual domestic advanced biofuel and feedstock supplies.

EPA should also scrap the plan to de-value imported fuels and feedstocks, especially when the mandate can’t be satisfied without them. There are other issues as well:

Not every advanced biofuel production facility or refinery in the United States has equal or economic access to domestic soybean oil. In fact, it would add significant time and cost if coastal facilities far from the U.S. Heartland were made to run solely on domestic feedstocks.

Refineries and biofuel manufacturing facilities often have long-term feedstock contracts, some of which already extend into the 2026 RFS compliance year. Feedstock origin has never been part of the RFS credit value calculus, and EPA cannot suddenly insert that into the program, particularly since major business decisions have been made in the years since the RFS was enacted based on an understanding of how the federal government viewed and valued biofuel feedstocks.

There are mile-wide loopholes in the import penalty plan. EPA’s proposal would punish U.S. fuel manufacturers who import ‘crushed’ feedstocks into the United States to make biofuels here. It would, likewise, punish imports even if they were made from U.S. soy, but crushed elsewhere, before being imported back into the United States. However, foreign soy that gets imported and crushed here, would get full credit under EPA’s RFS proposal. That’s illogical.

Just on the news of EPA’s proposal, RFS credit prices and soybean oil commodity prices jumped because the market recognizes there’s a scarcity of domestic feedstocks and fuel to fully satisfy EPA’s proposal. For an administration that prioritizes American energy dominance and affordability, this RFS proposal is way out of line.

It's EV Charging - GovTech,"Skip Descant, www.govtech.com, Skip-Descant.html",,,,,https://www.govtech.com/transportation/the-next-must-have-amenity-in-apartments-its-ev-charging,"Installing electric vehicle (EV) charging in apartment building parking lots and garages can be a costly, problematic upgrade that still holds an uncertain payoff in many parts of the country.
The United States includes some 23 million apartments, Theresa Kaiser-White, vice president for asset management and procurement at Willow Bridge Property Company, reminded panelists during a webinar Wednesday organized by Forth Mobility, on the issue of EV charging at multifamily housing.
“We are starting to see developers advancing some of their initiatives for EV charging.
Kaiser-White compared charging to television cable service “in the old days.” “You’ve got to have service,” she said.
“EV adoption has grown extremely rapidly over that few years,” Hazelton said Thursday during a Transportation Research Board panel on EV charging at airports.","Installing electric vehicle (EV) charging in apartment building parking lots and garages can be a costly, problematic upgrade that still holds an uncertain payoff in many parts of the country. But the future is pointing toward charging as an increasingly expected parking amenity.

Onsite charging for EVs has long been seen by many advocates as an essential feature of apartment living, if the technology ever has a chance of breaking into the mainstream.

The United States includes some 23 million apartments, Theresa Kaiser-White, vice president for asset management and procurement at Willow Bridge Property Company, reminded panelists during a webinar Wednesday organized by Forth Mobility, on the issue of EV charging at multifamily housing.

“We are starting to see developers advancing some of their initiatives for EV charging. And then there’s also states that are mandating EV charging,” Kaiser-White said during the panel, as she urged her colleagues in the multifamily housing sector to become more informed about how to plan for charging infrastructure, and the many different approaches this can take. That’s because on the one hand, she said, more states and regions are requiring new construction to at least be wired for chargers; and, on the other, residents are increasingly coming to expect chargers as they would any other amenity.

Kaiser-White compared charging to television cable service “in the old days.”

“You’ve got to have service,” she said. “People demand the service. And it has to be good service. It can’t be marginal.”

That service can take many forms. One approach often used is to simply let a third party install and operate the chargers, with residents paying to use them, much like they might pay to use a charger in a parking garage or retail location. In this model, the property owner or manager could, Kaiser-White said, even work out a revenue-sharing agreement.

That arrangement could raise eyebrows among residents, however, Randy McCourt, honorary member of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, said, noting multifamily housing residents “are really clamoring” for EV charging at a fair rate where third parties are not setting charging rates at an astronomically expensive level.

When a third-party vendor gets involved, “the user is feeling that’s not really good for them,” McCourt said during the panel. “I’m not sure we’ve landed on the right solution quite yet.”

The growth and transition to EVs continues to press forward, experts say. Rex Hazelton, senior associate at the Cadmus Group, a consulting firm, said EV adoption is as high as 30 percent in some parts of the country, as electric vehicles made up about 10 percent of new vehicle sales last year.

“EV adoption has grown extremely rapidly over that few years,” Hazelton said Thursday during a Transportation Research Board panel on EV charging at airports.

Hazelton said he expects to see “a slight slowdown” in the next two years, as federal purchase incentives wind down. However, electric cars will “continue to be a large portion of new vehicle sales.”

It’s not just apartment building owners, managers and developers who need to understand the nature of shared EV charging; charge-point providers and policymakers designing incentive programs also need to understand the many nuances of the multifamily housing industry.

The developer who builds a property with the plan to immediately sell is “a different business model,” and charge-point operators need to understand how the car-charging system they propose or install needs to work within this scenario, said Whitaker Jamieson, a senior specialist at Forth, during Thursday’s panel.

“That is something I have not seen, incentive providers really understanding and creating incentives that are geared toward that specific build-construction setup,” he said. “I want to see more incentive providers looking at these different build scenarios and retrofit situations, based on different market segments, based on the age of the building.”

And likewise, building planners and operators need to understand the nature of charging, various development codes, and the need to collaborate with utilities and other stakeholders before deploying EV infrastructure.

“You just can’t put chargers in and have them there,” Kaiser-White said. “You have to have a systematic approach to managing and monitoring the performance of the chargers, and the maintenance of the chargers.

“There’s a lot more to it than just sticking some chargers in the garage, and trying to satisfy the requirement, or what you believe is a need for residents,” she said.

Data generated through the program is used not only to assist federal and state officials, but also stakeholder groups, affected communities, researchers, and more.

The program—fully authorized under the Clean Air Act—imposes minimal burdens on companies, requiring only that affected sources measure and report their greenhouse gas emissions to EPA, and only applies to sources that emit more than 25,000 metric tons per year of carbon dioxide or its equivalent. The program has been a vital source of data for EPA’s Inventory on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks, an annual report that the United States government must submit to the United Nations according to international treaty.

The proposed elimination of the program is the latest in a series of actions by EPA to systematically dismantle, delay, or undermine the many climate and clean air standards that safeguard the health and wellbeing of families and communities. These include proposals to disavow EPA’s authority to control greenhouse gases and gut federal vehicle emission standards; draft rules that eliminate strengthened protections against mercury and ozone-forming compounds, delay badly-needed methane standards for oil and gas equipment; and handouts to dozens of coal-fired power plants that allow them to avoid Biden-era limits on air toxics.

In response, Sierra Club’s Director of Climate Policy and Advocacy, Patrick Drupp, released the following statement:

“EPA cannot avoid the climate crisis by simply burying its head in the sand as it baselessly cuts off its main source of greenhouse gas emissions data. The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has been a major success for more than 15 years, providing incredibly useful emission data without any real drawbacks to affected companies. The agency has provided no defensible reason to cancel the program; this is nothing more than EPA’s latest action to deny the reality of climate change and do everything it can to put the fossil fuel industry and corporate polluters before people. The Sierra Club will oppose this proposal every step of the way.”

But President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill this year delayed collection of the so-called Waste Emissions Charge until 2034, and EPA argued in a press release Friday that Trump’s law permitted it to propose suspending the reporting requirement for climate pollution until that year as well.

EPA told POLITICO’s E&E News that it still plans to propose revisions in July 2026 to reporting methodologies for emitters under subpart W of the Inflation Reduction Act — which covers onshore and offshore oil and gas development, processing, transmission, storage, and export activities.

The Friday proposal would exempt about 8,000 entities in a wide array of sectors from reporting their emissions if they exceed 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in a given year. EPA said in its press release that the proposal would save $2.4 billion in compliance costs by canceling a program that is not tied to any regulations and thus “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.”

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

The agency heard from several industry groups prior to releasing the draft who argued that the reporting program benefited them by compiling comprehensive, methodologically sound data across key industries.

Carbon capture and storage developers are among them. Treasury Department rules for tax credits benefiting the industry utilize EPA data drawn from the reporting program to determine eligibility.

“This announcement from EPA will not advance carbon storage — something Administrator Zeldin has publicly supported,” said Jessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition. “By canceling parts of the [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program] that are linked to the election of the 45Q tax credit, this proposed rule endangers millions of dollars in investments from American businesses in these technologies.”

Joe Goffman, who led the EPA Office of Air and Radiation in the Biden administration, said it would take years to rebuild the emissions reporting program and database if EPA mothballs it. That would set climate policy back in future administrations, he said, because good data is needed to inform regulations.

“This administration is sort of the Baskin-Robbins of climate policy destruction,” he said in an interview prior to the proposal’s release. “Every day there’s a new flavor of the day. One day it’s the power plant repeal flavor. The next day it’s the car and truck emissions repeal flavor. And the next day after that, it’s the endangerment finding withdrawal flavor.

“Today’s is proposing to shut down … or heavily curtail the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program,” Goffman said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/37/41/831d7c2d4bc98d5a2ff3b3bc5e2c/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2231529607,N,,2025-09-12 18:03:05.622654

By contrast, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas expect high growth in total electricity demand.
ICF modeled the types of energy generation resources likely to be built in the future, leveraging data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The report notes that advancing these programs could help meet over 10% of the national peak electricity demand by 2030.
Fortunately, many states, localities, utilities, and grid operators are working on solutions—including distributed energy resources and advanced transmission technologies (ATTs)—to modernize the energy grid.","The overall demand for energy from the electric grid in the United States, also known as “load,” is projected to increase 25% by 2030 and 78% by 2050, according to a new report by consulting firm ICF. After over a decade of minimal change, this growth is due to a combination of transportation- and building-sector electrification, the power needs of data centers for artificial intelligence and cloud services, and industrial manufacturing.

To help manage this increase—while keeping energy costs down and reliability high for customers throughout the U.S.—governments and utilities will need to make significant upgrades to the grid and scale innovative energy technologies.

Potential customer impacts

In the report, ICF analyzed four utilities across the country and projects that residential electricity rates for consumers will increase 15% to 40% by 2030, compared with 2025 rates. DTE Energy customers in Michigan, for example, may see an increase from just over 20 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in 2025 to nearly 30 cents per kWh in 2030. By 2050, electricity rates could double for some utilities.

Regionally, the increase in demand is expected to vary throughout the country. For example, the Intermountain West is expecting relatively modest overall and peak electricity demand growth through 2035. By contrast, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Texas expect high growth in total electricity demand.

Reliability at risk

Utilities reliably operate the grid by always having more electricity available than they’ll need to meet peak demand—an excess called the “reserve margin.” Reserve margins vary by region but are typically 15%-20% of peak demand. However, many parts of the U.S. will experience below-target reserve margins as soon as 2030, according to the report. And without new resources—such as solar and batteries—for utilities to tap into, new interconnection requests from growing industries, including data centers, may be denied.

New generation is needed

To meet the growing electricity demand, the U.S. will need to build about 80 gigawatts (GW) of additional capacity per year over the next 20 years. That’s up from the 40 GW average of new capacity built annually over the past five years. ICF modeled the types of energy generation resources likely to be built in the future, leveraging data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The report shows that new solar, wind, and battery storage are projected to be installed more than any other types of generation by 2050. Specifically, ICF forecasts that solar will make up around 30% of that new capacity, battery storage will be around 20%, and onshore wind just under 20%. The remaining 30% of new capacity would come from a mix of natural gas, offshore wind, nuclear power, and other resources.

Adding new generation quickly can be a challenge, hindered by supply chain constraints and efforts to make necessary upgrades to transmission and distribution systems. Nevertheless, utilities, grid operators, and local governments are looking to offset the growth in electricity demand by improving how they manage load through solutions like rooftop solar and battery storage—technologies that can generate and deliver energy on site. Other approaches to enhance load management include employing demand response programs – voluntary incentive programs that reduce or shift a customer’s electricity usage during peak periods – and promoting energy efficiency. The report notes that advancing these programs could help meet over 10% of the national peak electricity demand by 2030.

Fortunately, many states, localities, utilities, and grid operators are working on solutions—including distributed energy resources and advanced transmission technologies (ATTs)—to modernize the energy grid. Indiana and Utah are among the states advancing ATT solutions, with each state recently passing laws encouraging ATT deployment to enable their transmission system to deliver more power to customers, including through new generation. Energy researchers are also exploring how new data centers can operate more flexibly to ease the strain on the grid.

With energy demand set to grow rapidly in the U.S., it’s critical that governments and utilities adopt pragmatic and affordable solutions and scale them as fast as possible to reduce the burden on the grid and deliver benefits to consumers.

Building new combined cycle gas turbine plants, which leverage abundant, low-cost natural gas and provide baseload power is also impractical as an immediate solution.
One immediate solution exists: convert natural gas peaker plants to full-time combined cycle gas turbine plants.
The study identifies approximately 30% of U.S. peaker plants as high-potential candidates for conversion to combined-cycle plants, with another 11% showing moderate potential.
The path for increased baseload energy requires a pragmatic and innovative approach, particularly as American technology companies navigate an intensifying AI arms race with global competitors.","The artificial intelligence (AI) arms race is sparking an unprecedented surge in energy demand, with $400 billion of capital investments pouring into new data centers across the U.S. This influx is set to push electricity demand beyond existing supplies, raising critical questions about how to meet the country’s power needs through 2030. As the clock ticks down, it is essential to identify reliable and immediate sources of power.

Intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar, while relatively quick to deploy, cannot reliably meet the round-the-clock power needs of data centers without extensive and expensive energy storage and grid backup.

Advanced nuclear power, such as small modular nuclear reactors, can help provide dispatchable baseload power. Yet, regulatory approval processes are likely to delay operation of small nuclear reactors well into the 2030s.

Building new combined cycle gas turbine plants, which leverage abundant, low-cost natural gas and provide baseload power is also impractical as an immediate solution. Wait times (i.e., interconnection queues) for new combined cycle plants to connect to the grid range from 3 to 5 years, and supply chain constraints for new gas turbines have not only doubled their price but also pushed current orders well into the 2030s, restricting the feasibility of new combined-cycle natural gas plants as a practical solution.

Taken together, these options are too slow, too costly, or too unreliable to meet today’s demand. One immediate solution exists: convert natural gas peaker plants to full-time combined cycle gas turbine plants.

Peaker plants are gas-turbine powered facilities that operate intermittently, meeting peak power demands and running between 5 to 15% of the time. By adding water boilers and steam turbines to these existing plants, they can run continuously and increase their generation capacity by 50%. This conversion process enhances efficiency, extends capacity factor, and supports baseload operation, all while leveraging existing interconnection points, zoning, and infrastructure. As a result, permitting hurdles are reduced compared to new builds. With no significant supply chain constraints for boilers and steam turbines, peaker conversion can occur within a year, presenting an immediate addition of reliable and dispatchable electricity to the grid.

A recent nation-wide assessment of the U.S. gas peaker fleet sought to address this possibility by analyzing the policy environment, site feasibility, economic margins and gas turbine suitability for conversion. The study identifies approximately 30% of U.S. peaker plants as high-potential candidates for conversion to combined-cycle plants, with another 11% showing moderate potential. Converting these plants could add between 858 and 1,170 terawatt-hours to the grid, exceeding projected energy needs of planned data centers through 2030. This conversion strategy offers a practical approach to bridging the gap between energy demand and supply while utilizing existing generation assets.

Although gas peakers are already connected to the grid, they still require grid operator approval for conversion. To unlock the potential of peaker plant conversions, grid operators must streamline their approval processes. A sensible step would be for operators nationwide to offer ‘fast-track’ permissions, or conversion approval within a few weeks, akin to PJM's recent Reliability Resource Initiative. Implementing these simple reforms can unlock a surge in power generation capacity, reducing the likelihood of debilitating blackouts.

The path for increased baseload energy requires a pragmatic and innovative approach, particularly as American technology companies navigate an intensifying AI arms race with global competitors. By recognizing the unique role that gas peaker conversions can play in providing immediate baseload power, we can ensure that the U.S. maintains its edge in the global AI landscape.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required all developed countries to provide data on their domestic emissions each year.","The Environmental Protection Agency moved on Friday to stop requiring thousands of polluting facilities to report the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that they release into the air.

The E.P.A. proposal would end requirements for thousands of coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills and other industrial facilities across the country. The government has been collecting this data since 2010 and it is a key tool it uses to track carbon dioxide, methane and other gases that are driving climate change.

The Friday announcement comes as the Trump administration has systematically erased mentions of climate change from government websites while slashing federal funding for research on global warming.

“Alongside President Trump, E.P.A. continues to live up to the promise of unleashing energy dominance that powers the American dream,” Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in a statement. “The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

Mr. Zeldin said that ending the program would save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in compliance costs. The New York Times could not independently verify that claim; representatives for E.P.A. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Critics said the proposal could hobble federal efforts to fight climate change, since the government cannot reduce emissions if it cannot measure how much is generated and where it is produced.

“With this move, they’re taking away the practical and material capacity of the federal government to do the basic elements of climate policymaking,” said Joseph Goffman, who led the E.P.A.’s air office during the Biden administration.

For the past 15 years, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program has collected data from about 8,000 of the country’s largest industrial facilities. That data has helped guide numerous decisions on federal policy and has been shared with the United Nations, which has required developed countries to submit tallies of their emissions.

In addition, private companies often rely on the program’s data to demonstrate to investors that their efforts to cut emissions are working. And communities often use it to determine whether local facilities are releasing air pollution that threatens public health.

The E.P.A. proposal would not directly eliminate emissions reporting requirements for certain oil and gas facilities, including pipelines transporting natural gas. That is because those reports were required by Congress as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Instead, the E.P.A. is proposing to allow those specific oil and gas facilities to postpone emissions reporting until 2034. Congressional Republicans already delayed a related requirement for the facilities to pay a fee on their methane emissions until 2034.

Representatives for oil and gas industry trade and lobbying groups, including the American Petroleum Institute, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The proposal follows a rapid-fire series of steps by the Trump administration to weaken or dismantle environmental protections.

In July, the E.P.A. moved to repeal the scientific finding that underpins the government’s legal authority to combat climate change. And in recent weeks, the White House has directed a half-dozen agencies to thwart the country’s offshore wind industry, a key source of emissions-free electricity.

Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the United Nations has required all developed countries to provide data on their domestic emissions each year. But the United States missed an April deadline to submit its data, and Mr. Trump began the year-long process of withdrawing from the Paris pact on his first day back in office.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/12/multimedia/12cli-emissions-btcq/12cli-emissions-btcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 15:59:39.762451

However, that's for global sales.
But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.
EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024.
""Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,"" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester.","Here's some good news for a Friday afternoon: For 2025 through August, global electric vehicle sales have grown by 25 percent compared to the same eight months in 2024, according to the analysts at Rho Motion. That amounts to 12.5 million EVs, although the data combines both battery EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs for the total.

However, that's for global sales. In fact, EV adoption is moving even faster in Europe, which has grown by 31 percent so far this year (Rho says that BEV sales grew by 31 percent but PHEV sales by just 30 percent)—a total of 2.6 million plug-in vehicles. In some European countries, the increase has been even more impressive: up by 45 percent in Germany, 41 percent in Italy, and by 100 percent in Spain.

But despite a number of interesting new EVs from Renault and the various Stellantis-owned French automakers, EV sales in France are down by 6 percent so far, year on year.

Tesla has seen none of this sales growth in Europe, however—as we noted last month, this region's Tesla sales collapsed by 40 percent in July.

China had bought an additional 7.6 million new EVs between January and August of this year, although this growth slowed in July and August, partially as a consequence of robust sales during those months in 2024 thanks to Chinese government policies. And as also noted last month, BYD recently saw a drop in profitability and has downgraded its sales target by 900,000 vehicles (down to 4.6 million) for this year.

Meanwhile, here in North America, things aren't quite so hot. EV sales are still growing but barely—up just 6 percent between January and August 2025 compared to the same time period in 2024. August was actually a good month for EV sales in the US as consumers rushed to dealerships to take advantage of the IRS 30D tax credit for clean vehicles, which disappears at the end of September.

That's a result of anti-EV policies put in place by President Trump and Republicans in Congress, and it's far from the only one. Other tax credits intended to foster EV adoption by businesses are also being eradicated. The Environmental Protection Agency is no longer fining automakers for failing to meet fleet averages, and the Trump administration has clawed back money earmarked for charging infrastructure.

""Global EV sales have now reached 12.5 million units in the opening eight months of the year,"" said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester. ""The North American market has reached a record monthly high as consumers in the US accelerate purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expires at the end of September.

Abstract

Our study reviews the current status of global electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure development, emphasizing policy drivers, market dynamics, and technological advancements in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other regions. By referencing recent research and survey data, the study identifies the primary challenges faced by the current charging infrastructure, including high construction costs, lack of standardization, grid load pressure, low usage efficiency, and insufficient policy support. Specifically, by the end of 2023, the global number of fast charging stations reached 50,000, with an annual growth rate of 50%; China's public charging stations exceeded 1.3 million, with a 44% annual growth rate; the United States had 150,000 public charging stations, while Canada had 30,000. In Europe, the number of public charging stations exceeded 400,000, with Germany having 120,000, the Netherlands having 150 stations per 100 square kilometers, and Norway having 20,000. The study also examines recent advancements in charging technology, such as fast charging stations above 350kW, wireless charging technology, the promotion of ISO 15118 charging standards, and the application of smart grids and energy management systems. Despite numerous challenges, the development of EV charging infrastructure is experiencing unprecedented opportunities. Moving forward, it is essential for governments, enterprises, and research institutions to enhance policy support, technological innovation, market incentives, and international cooperation to collectively improve charging infrastructure and advance the EV market.",https://authorea.com//d197for5662m48.cloudfront.net/assets/blog/default_image-be9182bca7b6523bb6c72e32e5c12398f36b92d81f6ee7882327b6145744bf1f.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 19:01:31.369676

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-12 18:58:11+00:00,New Orleans CityBusiness,U.S. lawmakers are hoping to overhaul the federal permitting process | New Orleans CityBusiness,The Center Square,,,,,https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/blog/2025/09/12/speed-act-energy-permitting-reform/,"Lawmakers in Washington are worried that future could be limited by the cumbersome and costly permitting process that businesses are saddled with and are bringing a package of bills to address it.
If the proposal becomes law, the National Environmental Policy Act would be less scrutinous and easier for businesses and industries to work around.
Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., called the environmental law “broken,” noting that related litigation takes an average of 4.2 years to resolve.
“The delta here is enormous – one of the huge problems is the pace of our permitting process,” Hochman said.
The section “would effectively block most, if not all, challenges,” said Robert Glicksman, a law professor from George Washington University.","On Wednesday, Jim Burke, an energy business man and board member of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said that the future of energy development will happen along the Gulf Coast.

“There’s just an incredible concentration of assets between between here and Baton Rouge, right though Houston,” Burke said at the Tulane Future of Energy Forum.

Lawmakers in Washington are worried that future could be limited by the cumbersome and costly permitting process that businesses are saddled with and are bringing a package of bills to address it.

The U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Natural Resources debated that package on Wednesday, with the marquee proposal – the SPEED Act – under particular scrutiny. If the proposal becomes law, the National Environmental Policy Act would be less scrutinous and easier for businesses and industries to work around.

Federal agencies are required to carefully consider the environmental impacts of their actions before making decisions. For major projects such as highways, pipelines, or energy facilities, the law typically requires the preparation of an environmental assessment or a more detailed environmental impact statement that evaluates potential effects on the environment.

Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., called the environmental law “broken,” noting that related litigation takes an average of 4.2 years to resolve. The bill would clarify which federal actions trigger the law’s guidelines, set clearer requirements for environmental reviews, and require lawsuits to be filed within 150 days by someone who participated in the public comment process.

The bill also limits courts’ authority in NEPA cases, allowing judges only to send projects back to agencies for further review rather than halt them outright – a provision Westerman and other Republicans said would prevent projects from being killed by lawsuits.

“This is about durable reforms that create predictability for all energy sources,” said Jeremy Harrell, a lobbyist for ClearPath. Harrell described the bill as “technology-agnostic” and aimed at providing regulatory certainty for everything from fossil fuel projects to renewable energy.

Supporters also framed permitting reform as essential to U.S. economic competitiveness and national security. Lawmakers warned that permitting delays threaten critical energy infrastructure and slow the deployment of new electricity generation just as artificial intelligence is driving a surge in power demand.

“It already takes us 29 years on average to develop a new mine – second worst in the world, just ahead of Zambia,” said Thomas Hochman with the Foundation for American Innovation, adding that slow permitting puts the U.S. at risk of falling behind China in next-generation energy technologies.

Hochman also pointed to Anthropic’s estimate that America will need 50 gigawatts of new electricity for artificial intelligence by 2028, but the last two nuclear plants took 16 years to bring just 2 gigawatts online.

“The delta here is enormous – one of the huge problems is the pace of our permitting process,” Hochman said.

Much of the committee remain unconvinced, and brought their own witnesses before the committee to explain why.

Robert Glicksman, a George Washington University law professor, warned that one section of the bill would make it nearly impossible to challenge deficient reviews.

The section “would effectively block most, if not all, challenges,” said Robert Glicksman, a law professor from George Washington University. “The statute would require any litigant to prove that an agency’s failure to consider their input caused direct harm. But that’s nearly impossible.”

Perhaps most controversial is the bill’s ban on injunctions.

Glicksman said that even if a court finds an agency’s review was inadequate, the project could continue while the analysis is redone.

“That runs contrary to decades of precedent under the Administrative Procedure Act, which gives courts the authority to halt unlawful agency action,” Glicksman said.

By removing this remedy, agencies would have little incentive to take the “hard look” the National Environmental Policy Act requires, knowing projects would move forward regardless of compliance, said Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Maine.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/09/2.-Depositphotos_oil-rig-well.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:00:37.317034

In this evolving landscape, companies that bridge traditional infrastructure expertise with renewable energy innovation are poised to capture significant value.

, a mechanical and electrical construction services leader, has positioned itself at the intersection of these forces through its involvement in high-impact sustainability projects and energy-efficient solutions. While direct financial metrics for 2025 remain opaque, the company's existing initiatives and industry alignment suggest a compelling growth trajectory.

A Proven Track Record in Renewable Energy Infrastructure

EMCOR's Capricorn Ridge Wind Project exemplifies its strategic focus on decarbonization. By generating 662.5 megawatts of clean energy—enough to power 220,000 homes—the project not only reduces carbon emissions but also creates 20,000 metric tonnes of carbon credits, a valuable asset in markets prioritizing environmental accountability EMCOR Group, Inc. - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. Such projects align with global trends: the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that wind energy capacity will expand by 80% by 2030, creating sustained demand for infrastructure developers and operators.

Beyond large-scale renewables, EMCOR's Facilities Services division has demonstrated agility in optimizing energy use for clients. A notable example is its HVAC replacement initiative for a retail banking portfolio, which has cumulatively saved $4.1 million in energy costs EMCOR Group, Inc. - Wikipedia[ 1 ]. These efficiency-driven solutions cater to corporate clients under pressure to meet ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) targets, a market segment expected to grow as institutional investors prioritize climate resilience.

Strategic Positioning in a Fragmented Market

EMCOR's expertise in industrial and energy infrastructure provides a critical advantage. The company's ability to execute complex mechanical and electrical systems—skills honed over decades in sectors like healthcare and data centers—translates seamlessly to renewable energy projects. For instance, the technical rigor required for solar farm grid integration or geothermal plant construction mirrors the precision demanded in traditional infrastructure, a niche where

has long excelled.

While specific market share data for 2023–2025 is unavailable, the company's historical presence in energy infrastructure and its alignment with sector-wide decarbonization goals suggest a strong foundation. Analysts at BloombergNEF note that firms with hybrid capabilities—combining traditional construction with green technology—will dominate the next phase of the energy transition, a category where EMCOR's profile fits squarely.

Growth Potential Amid Regulatory and Market Tailwinds

The absence of 2025 financial data does not negate EMCOR's long-term prospects. Policymakers in the U.S. and Europe are incentivizing renewable energy adoption through tax credits and infrastructure spending bills, creating a favorable environment for contractors. For example, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allocates $370 billion for clean energy initiatives, directly boosting demand for project developers and service providers. EMCOR's existing renewable energy projects, such as Capricorn Ridge, position it to benefit from these fiscal stimuli.

Moreover, the company's client-centric approach—evidenced by its energy-saving HVAC programs—highlights a scalable business model. As corporations face stricter carbon reporting requirements, demand for energy efficiency services is projected to grow at a 7.5% CAGR through 2030, according to a 2024 report by McKinsey & Company. EMCOR's ability to deliver measurable cost and emissions reductions could further solidify its relevance in this expanding market.

Conclusion

Rho Motion found that EV sales in North America, which included the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, are up 6% year-to-date.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashed billions of dollars in clean energy tax credits that the Biden administration enacted through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

The megabill, signed by Trump on July 4, eliminated the IRA’s EV tax credits, which offered consumers up to $7,500 for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for a used one. The credits are set to expire on Sept. 30.

The EV tax credits were intended to encourage consumers to purchase battery-powered vehicles. But Trump and Republicans have criticized the tax incentives and regulations meant to boost EVs as costly and coercive.

“Growth has increased due to an increase in EV sales in the U.S. in August 2025 as consumers bring forward purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it ends on Sept. 30, 2025. We also expect September sales to be strong, followed by a large reduction in monthly sales in the final quarter of the year,” Rho Motion wrote.

With the tax credits set to expire, industry experts believe EV adoption will likely decline. Still, U.S. automakers such as Ford are adapting to these changes. For instance, the auto manufacturer announced plans to produce a midsize pickup truck priced around $30,000 by 2027.

“Sales in the rest of the world have taken off as emerging markets are leapfrogging over the gas car phase and moving directly to electric vehicles,” Ingrid Malmgren, the senior policy director of Plug-In American, said in a statement.

“EVs are here to stay,” Malmgren added. “They save drivers all over the world money by eliminating reliance on gasoline, they improve air quality in cities globally, and they provide a superior driver experience with less maintenance. They are simply better vehicles.”

Sales are up in other regions such as Europe, with a 31% year-to-date rise in sales. China is also experiencing a 25% year-to-date increase in sales.

Rho Motion noted that year-over-year growth in the Chinese market slowed in July and August in comparison to last year, when there was a significant rise in EV demand due to an increase in subsidies.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25238683773408.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-12 15:00:49.078108

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides significant relief for Americans by offering up to $3,200 annually for qualifying energy-efficient home improvements – helping households lower utility bills and reduce overall living costs. Families using the credit not only saved an average of $882 on their taxes, but also lowered their energy bills by an average of about $130 in the first year according to analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit was created on a bipartisan basis in 2005, and expanded by Congressional Democrats as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The letter reads, in part:

If our colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly intended to eliminate [the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit], they should have cited the law correctly – Congress writes laws, and sloppy drafting is no excuse for the Treasury department to substitute its policy preferences for the language of the law as enacted.

Reps. Horsford and Gomez released the following statement:

“The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit has helped Americans make ends meet and modernize their energy consumption for two decades,” Rep. Horsford said. “In Nevada, these tax credits make clean energy solutions affordable for more people, help lower energy bills, protect my constituents from extreme heat in the summer, and foster good paying jobs in our community.

“Despite Republican claims, these credits remain in effect for seven more years,” Horsford continued. “As such, the IRS must update its website to provide accurate information about the program. As President Trump raises costs on everyday goods, the American people deserve to know that programs still exist to help lower energy costs.”

“I wrote the Home Energy Savings Act, which was signed into law through the IRA, because working families deserve to get real savings on their energy bills,” Rep. Gomez said. “Despite Republican efforts to repeal this tax credit, 25C is still the law of the land through 2032, and families should keep getting the savings they were promised. I led the fight to create this credit, and I’ll keep leading the fight to protect it.”

Toyota is adjusting production at its assembly plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, to make room for a pair of upcoming electric SUVs. While the company hasn't released many official details about the duo, it has confirmed to Car and Driver that the new three-row EV SUVs will both be built in Kentucky. Toyota is also making changes at its Indiana plant by expanding production of the Grand Highlander.

""To improve manufacturing efficiencies and better serve customers based on market demand, Toyota is strategically transitioning production across our plants in Kentucky and Indiana,"" the company said in a statement. ""Toyota Indiana will continue to assemble the Grand Highlander in its west plant and add assembly of the vehicle to its east plant to accommodate increased production volume.""

Toyota declined to discuss any details about the forthcoming EV SUVs, but a recent report from Reuters suggests that they will be based on the Land Cruiser and RAV4. The news outlet claims that this is according to an anonymous source familiar with the situation. We've also already seen images of the Land Cruiser Se concept, which could preview a production version. As for the reported RAV4 EV, it could fill the gap between the recently revealed CH-R EV and an electric pickup truck, based on the image above that Toyota showed earlier this year.

Sales in the United States accelerated to reach a monthly record in August, due to the upcoming expiry of the tax credits in September, Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, said.

Emissions legislation continues to underpin sales in the top European markets Germany and the UK, while China’s growth slowed compared to high sales numbers a year ago at the start of the Chinese trade-in scheme.

“Y-o-y growth in the Chinese market slowed in July-August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,” Lester said.

Year to date, global EV sales rose by 25%, with Chinese growth also at 25% and Europe’s sales increase at 31%.

North American EV sales rose by 6% between January and August, but there is high uncertainty from the fourth quarter onwards, in view of the end of the tax credits.

The rush to take advantage of the tax credits pushed the U.S. electric vehicle market to its highest-ever monthly sales in August, with over 175,000 units sold, Rho Motion’s EV & Battery Database showed earlier this week.

Under the OBBBA, the 30D purchase credit and the 45W leasing credit – both worth up to $7,500 on eligible EVs – will end.

Knight Frank reported that 2024 electricity production was dominated by wind, solar, hydro and nuclear energy, which collectively for almost two-thirds of the generation that year.
“With the UK Government setting an ambitious target of 95% low-carbon energy by 2030, there are significant opportunities for investors, developers and operators.","Drax’s findings are backed up by data from real estate consultancy Knight Frank, which has found a surge in all low-carbon energy industries, with significant opportunities available for investors and developers.

Drax’s report, produced by Imperial College London, shows that the carbon intensity of electricity in Britain has fallen below 100g of CO2 for the first time – and is now more than 350 gCO2/kWh lower than a decade ago.

Solar power is key to this reduction in carbon-emitting energy sources, with more than 3GW of solar generation capacity having been added in Britain since 2023.

The nation now hosts around 20GW of solar. Solar’s contribution to the country’s energy mix reached 40% of the total in May 2025, and June saw the cleanest day in Britain’s history, with grid emissions averaging only 28 gCO2/kWh.

Dr Iain Staffell, lead author of Electric Insights at Imperial College London, said: “This data shows just how quickly Britain’s electricity mix is changing. Solar generation is now making a visible dent in our national emissions, helping to drive the grid to its cleanest quarter on record.

“While these results are encouraging, we cannot underestimate the scale of the challenge. Hotter summers and rising demand for cooling are creating new pressures, and the curtailment of renewable power shows that our infrastructure is not yet keeping pace with supply.

“The next stage of our energy transition is about locking in the benefits of clean generation all year-round by expanding storage, strengthening the grid, and finding smarter ways to balance the system.”

The UK Government is notably striving for gas to account for no more than 5% of the electricity mix by the end of the decade. This is known as its ‘Clean Power 2030’ ambition.

Knight Frank research

Research by Knight Frank has backed up Drax’s report, finding that renewable energy capital is continuing to drive and accelerate the UK energy transition.

Investment in renewables is booming, the report found, with £4.4bn of mergers and acquisitions involving ready-to-build and operational renewable assets occurring in 2024 alone.

Peak capacity of transacted onshore wind, solar and battery storage reached 6GW in 2023, and just below 5GW in 2024.

Knight Frank reported that 2024 electricity production was dominated by wind, solar, hydro and nuclear energy, which collectively for almost two-thirds of the generation that year. However, to continue this trend, the company said, planning approval timescales and grid capacity must significantly improve to facilitate new projects and expand at scale.

Currently, median planning times for projects which obtained planning were 1.5 years for onshore wind, and ten months for large-scale solar ground and ground & roof projects. For those projects which have submitted planning that is not yet granted, refused or withdrawn, the median time to approval sits at one year for large-scale solar, 18 months for onshore wind and eight months for battery energy storage projects.

Construction timelines are also a significant challenge, with around 70% of projects with planning permission ‘awaiting construction’.

Knight Frank’s head of ESG and sustainability research, Flora Harley, said: “There is an encouraging picture across all low-carbon energy sources, with solar standing out as the furthest advanced and gathering pace – there has already been more solar generated in 2025 than in the entirety of 2024.

“With the UK Government setting an ambitious target of 95% low-carbon energy by 2030, there are significant opportunities for investors, developers and operators. Supportive policies such as the Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan and the Solar Roadmap will help galvanise these efforts across the UK and sustain momentum during the transition.”

,North Carolina Environment,2025-09-12 16:50:38+00:00,Reasons to be Cheerful,One City's Race to 'Solarize Everything We Possibly Can' - Reasons to be Cheerful,"Peter Yeung, Elizabeth Ouzts, Chris York",,,,,https://reasonstobecheerful.world/bordeaux-france-solar-city-race/,"“We have to solarize everything we possibly can,” says Claudine Bichet, the deputy mayor responsible for climate change and the energy transition at Bordeaux City Hall.
In 2020, Bordeaux produced just three percent of its own energy.
The future of urban solar in Bordeaux, therefore, is bright.
A survey published in May 2024 found that 87 percent of French people have “a positive opinion of solar energy,” compared with 67 percent for wind energy and 59 percent for nuclear power.
Solar energy also must be combined with other energy sources, adds Reinders, since the sun is not always shining.","Bordeaux’s submarine base was once a place of battle. Built by the Germans during the Second World War, the hulking concrete edifice in the north of the wine-loving French city was used to launch attacks against the Allied Forces. Today, however, the site is fighting a different kind of fight — the war on fossil fuels.

Its ammunition is 6,600 photovoltaic panels, which are being transported from the ground somewhat spectacularly by helicopter, reducing emissions five-fold compared to using cranes, according to city authorities. The outcome: A 13,000 square meter solar power plant, set to produce 3.4 megawatts of energy, which when completed in March 2026 will be the largest urban rooftop solar site in France.

“We have to solarize everything we possibly can,” says Claudine Bichet, the deputy mayor responsible for climate change and the energy transition at Bordeaux City Hall. “We believe in this approach and we are advancing very quickly.”

Since the election of Bordeaux’s ecologist mayor Pierre Hurmic in 2020, the ninth biggest city in France has undergone an electrifying transformation, underlining the growing potential and need for urban solar. In 2020, Bordeaux produced just three percent of its own energy. By the end of 2026, the proportion is set to reach 41 percent, largely thanks to solar but also through other renewables like wind and biomass.

That incredible transformation is in significant part thanks to the 60,000 square meters of solar panels that are being installed across the city on municipal buildings and in public spaces, from the roof of the iconic submarine base to schools, sports facilities, city hall, parking lots, cycle paths and even the city’s ring road.

It’s a shining example of harnessing sun-sourced energy and Bichet is unequivocal about the city’s goal: “We want to become France’s number one solar city.”

By the end of 2025, more than half of the targeted 60,000 square meters of solar will have been completed, according to Bichet, and she says the city is confident of reaching its ultimate goal by the end of next year.

One phase of the strategy focuses on what can go on the city’s rooftops. Bordeaux, which receives nearly 2,100 hours of sunshine per year, estimates that 354 of its municipal buildings are sufficiently exposed to the sun’s rays to produce significant amounts of solar energy.

Then there’s the transport infrastructure. Bordeaux aims to cover as much of its roads and cycle paths in solar as possible. As part of this, it has put out a call for proposals for the creation of a photovoltaic cover over two sections of the 275-kilometer ReVE cycle network, which should provide riders with shade in the summer and shelter from rain in the winter. Similarly, plans are underway to cover the city’s ring road with photovoltaic panels.

Ultimately, Bordeaux authorities see banking on solar energy as an affordable and accessible way of achieving its broader goals of shifting away from more polluting energy sources, like gas, towards electricity in the coming years, as well as cutting carbon emissions enough to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. At the same time, the overall objective is to reduce energy consumption by 25 percent across all sectors and uses.

The approaches to achieving these shifts have been wide-ranging.

For one, it is now obligatory for solar to be used on the roofs of new or renovated buildings of a certain size. The city has also encouraged private and public stakeholders to work together, launching a program in June 2024 to facilitate this called The Alliance for Solar. Dozens of businesses, social housing providers, and public and private developers have signed up, including for a project at the Bordeaux Lac exhibition center.

Bordeaux has also opened an online portal for citizens to propose renewable energy “production acceleration zones” — in effect, allowing them to highlight abandoned roads, undeveloped parking lots or vacant lots where panels can be installed.

“We have to encourage everyone,” says Bichet. “We have had meetings, shared learnings. We want to have an open door.”

Yet one particular challenge for Bordeaux, home to a UNESCO-protected historic center that includes 347 listed buildings, has been finding a way to preserve its buildings while installing solar on them. In-depth studies have been carried out to analyze technical constraints, the weight of frames and, indeed, sun exposure.

“We engaged with UNESCO and with other cities, and we did big internal work [at city hall],” says Bichet. “Heritage must develop with the challenges.”

That has not always been a smooth process. For example, not all of the submarine base’s roof will be covered in panels in order to avoid it being visible from the ground – some claimed it would be a blight on the historic building, yet others, underlining the urgency of the climate crisis, said the entire space should be used. Nonetheless, the project, even with the imposed limitations, will avoid the emissions of 800 tons of CO2 per year (the equivalent of 400 round trips between Paris and New York) and businesses located within a one kilometer radius will be able to consume this electricity at a stable price, providing benefits to locals.

Maria Wall, a professor at Lund University’s Energy and Building Design department in Sweden, commends the “very impressive” developments in Bordeaux and in particular its success in managing to roll out solar while preserving its historic heritage.

In the past, many permits for construction were rejected due to preservation protections, but after obtaining a relaxation of UNESCO rules, that’s changed. In 2024, Bordeaux processed 261 requests for solar panel permits, more than seven times the number in 2020 (37). What’s more, 100 percent of those applications in 2024 received a favorable opinion, compared to 62.2 percent in 2020, reflecting a better institutional understanding of the process.

Technological advances such as the ability to produce transparent solar panels, or ones styled like building materials such as terracotta, have made urban solar integration easier than ever, according to Angèle Reinders, a professor of design of sustainable energy systems at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands.

“These products already exist,” says Reinders, who co-authored a paper on building-integrated photovoltaics in May 2025. “In urban areas, it is already possible to make this integration seamlessly, reducing issues when it comes to building regulations and rules on use of property. If we are serious about the energy transition, then policy makers must help us overcome these permitting issues.”

Reinders also says that developing urban solar faces other restrictions that don’t pose an issue in rural areas, such as limited space and access to land. “Bordeaux’s plan to focus on municipal buildings is great and effective, since they own them,” she explains.

The future of urban solar in Bordeaux, therefore, is bright.

In France more broadly, solar appears to be the most appealing of all energy among the public. A survey published in May 2024 found that 87 percent of French people have “a positive opinion of solar energy,” compared with 67 percent for wind energy and 59 percent for nuclear power. And beginning in 2026, solar installations will be required on a significant number of buildings across the European Union, and public bodies will need to retroactively install solar on their buildings.

Solar energy also must be combined with other energy sources, adds Reinders, since the sun is not always shining. But she estimates that a city like Bordeaux could realistically source as much as 60 percent of its energy from the sun.

“Solar,” she says, “is such an abundant source of power.”",https://reasonstobecheerful.world/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1995036410-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 14:03:26.175587

Following the tightened tax credit eligibility laws outlined in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, municipalities and communities that are sticking to renewable energy goals are under pressure to accelerate project timelines.

Trenton Allen, whose company Sustainable Capital Advisors works to provide sustainable finance for clean energy developers, alongside other activities, sees a market ready to make the most of what’s left in the short term.

He explained that many municipal clients are now prioritizing projects to ensure they can fully leverage the federal incentives, such as the investment tax credits (ITCs) for projects in the residential and commercial sectors, which are now being removed earlier than planned. Developers are moving quickly through their procurement processes to identify and prioritize projects that are most likely to be completed within the required timeframe to secure maximum incentives.

“Prioritization is incredibly important because it allows developers to focus on projects that have the best chance to get done,” said Allen. “Other projects, they’re moving to the back burner, though these are still nice to have. There really is a prioritization that we’re seeing happening with many of our clients as they try to hit these windows to maximize the incentives that are available from these projects.”

Capital markets appear ready to support a high volume of projects on an accelerated timeline through commercial banks, community banks, and community development financial institutions (CDFIs). Allen said he foresees an uptick in green bonds and other municipal finance projects, as school districts and city governments seek to utilize their own credit to fund these initiatives.

“There’s a great opportunity available here in the short run,” said Allen. “Being able to meet this moment and to accelerate as much of these projects as we possibly can is incredibly important and will strengthen our overall energy system.”

Community solar

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to claw back all $7 billion of grants that were made available through the Solar For All program. There is likely to be ongoing litigation to decide the fate of these funds, and for now uncertainty clouds the outcome.

Solar For All provided grant funds primarily for community solar projects across the United States. Community solar offers a pathway for residents to access low-cost solar energy without having to invest in an on-site project.

Allen highlighted a successful community solar program in Washington, DC, which has significantly reduced household energy bills, by more than 50% in some cases. These savings provide real cash flow to households.

Beyond help for households struggling with their energy bills, these projects create local economic opportunities through jobs in construction and ongoing operations and maintenance. Here, Allen sees the need for policymakers to ensure a stable market that provides greater certainty to businesses investing in the projects. This is crucial in allowing them to take a long-term view on hiring and other investments – creating a market, not just a one-off project.

State support

As support for renewable energy is being phased out from the federal government’s plans, Allen sees both an opportunity and a responsibility for states to step in and fill this role.

He cited New York as a successful example, highlighting how the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) has helped overcome a major bottleneck by providing funding for early-stage, pre-development costs – the stage where many promising community-led projects fail.

State-level policies like this are key to avoiding a cliff and ensuring that the economic opportunities and energy resilience provided by solar and storage continue to strengthen communities and the overall energy grid. As the renewables sector across the United States adapts to new realities, Allen stressed the importance of using this period of acceleration to build momentum that will endure even after federal tax credits wind down.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/pexels-markusspiske-14384695-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 20:01:44.782313

Lawmakers in Washington are worried that future could be limited by the cumbersome and costly permitting process that businesses are saddled with and are bringing a package of bills to address it.

The U.S. House of Representatives’ Committee on Natural Resources debated that package on Wednesday, with the marquee proposal – the SPEED Act – under particular scrutiny. If the proposal becomes law, the National Environmental Policy Act would be less scrutinous and easier for businesses and industries to work around.

Federal agencies are required to carefully consider the environmental impacts of their actions before making decisions. For major projects such as highways, pipelines, or energy facilities, the law typically requires the preparation of an environmental assessment or a more detailed environmental impact statement that evaluates potential effects on the environment.

Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., called the environmental law “broken,” noting that related litigation takes an average of 4.2 years to resolve. The bill would clarify which federal actions trigger the law’s guidelines, set clearer requirements for environmental reviews, and require lawsuits to be filed within 150 days by someone who participated in the public comment process.

The bill also limits courts’ authority in NEPA cases, allowing judges only to send projects back to agencies for further review rather than halt them outright – a provision Westerman and other Republicans said would prevent projects from being killed by lawsuits.

“This is about durable reforms that create predictability for all energy sources,” said Jeremy Harrell, a lobbyist for ClearPath. Harrell described the bill as “technology-agnostic” and aimed at providing regulatory certainty for everything from fossil fuel projects to renewable energy.

Supporters also framed permitting reform as essential to U.S. economic competitiveness and national security. Lawmakers warned that permitting delays threaten critical energy infrastructure and slow the deployment of new electricity generation just as artificial intelligence is driving a surge in power demand.

“It already takes us 29 years on average to develop a new mine – second worst in the world, just ahead of Zambia,” said Thomas Hochman with the Foundation for American Innovation, adding that slow permitting puts the U.S. at risk of falling behind China in next-generation energy technologies.

Hochman also pointed to Anthropic’s estimate that America will need 50 gigawatts of new electricity for artificial intelligence by 2028, but the last two nuclear plants took 16 years to bring just 2 gigawatts online.

“The delta here is enormous – one of the huge problems is the pace of our permitting process,” Hochman said.

Much of the committee remain unconvinced, and brought their own witnesses before the committee to explain why.

Robert Glicksman, a George Washington University law professor, warned that one section of the bill would make it nearly impossible to challenge deficient reviews.

The section “would effectively block most, if not all, challenges,” said Robert Glicksman, a law professor from George Washington University. “The statute would require any litigant to prove that an agency’s failure to consider their input caused direct harm. But that’s nearly impossible.”

Perhaps most controversial is the bill’s ban on injunctions.

Glicksman said that even if a court finds an agency’s review was inadequate, the project could continue while the analysis is redone.

“That runs contrary to decades of precedent under the Administrative Procedure Act, which gives courts the authority to halt unlawful agency action,” Glicksman said.

Practical considerations An obvious question to come out of Georgia Power’s decision is why support fossil fuel plants at a time where the energy transition is more urgent than ever?
However, the RMI spokesperson tells PV Tech Premium that the financial argument in favour of fossil fuels is less compelling than ever.
“This is an example of what we’re seeing nationwide, unfortunately, that is particularly in Republican-led states, there is a lot of political pressure to support expansion of fossil fuels and increased dependence on fossil fuels, flowing from this federal administration on down to the state level,” he says.
However, he also suggests that the business model used by a number of utilities does not necessarily align with greater renewable energy deployment.","However, when asked if this IRP is the sort of robust middle ground that could help set a precedent for effectively transitioning from fossil fuel-dominated resource plans to ones that rely on renewable energy, Sean Garren, chief programs officer at advocacy group Vote Solar, tells PV Tech Premium that, “you’re probably being a little generous to the Georgia Power IRP.”

“This IRP, in general, is skewed so heavily towards fossil fuels and locking us into further dependence on fossil fuels and their unpredictable prices and market dynamics,” he continues. “I think the reality is that the gigawatts of renewable capacity in Georgia Power’s latest IRP are simply an admission that renewable energy is the only technical path forward – or at least a critical piece of the only technical path forward – to serving the growing demand for energy in the US.”

This shift towards greater reliance on fossil fuels in state IRPs is present across the US; when asked about the state of IRPs in the US at present, a spokesperson from think tank RMI says that more states are expecting to use more fossil fuels in the coming years.

“Utility resource plans now include 53GW more gas capacity than wind and solar capacity in 2035,” says the spokesperson. “This is a stark contrast to our Q2 2024 IRP review, in which planned wind and solar capacity in 2035 were nearly equivalent to planned gas capacity.”

With many utilities incentivised by market dynamics and their own business models to support fossil fuel developments, rather than renewable and distributed energy projects, questions remain as to how solar and storage projects can be better integrated into state IRPs in the future.

Practical considerations

An obvious question to come out of Georgia Power’s decision is why support fossil fuel plants at a time where the energy transition is more urgent than ever? To an extent, there is an increasing demand for electricity to meet – figures from RMI show that utilities that updated their IRPs in the second quarter of this year plan to increase project load by 2% through 2035 to meet growing electricity demand – and commissioning as much new power generating capacity from as many sources as possible is a route to meeting this demand.

However, the RMI spokesperson tells PV Tech Premium that the financial argument in favour of fossil fuels is less compelling than ever.

“With demand for gas turbines reaching new heights and tariffs further threatening international supply chains, costs for new gas plants are soaring,” says the spokesperson. “We see that the cost assumptions used in planning are growing year-over-year, and exceeding the levels commonly assumed in industry benchmark studies.”

The spokesperson notes that Duke Indiana’s latest cost estimates for its Cayuga combined-cycle gas plant, for instance, are 36% higher than in previous years’ resource plans. This translates to an US$900 million increase over planned costs for just one fossil fuel plant in the state.

“We know that there’s a multi-year waitlist for new gas turbines, that the waiting time to build out new fossil gas infrastructure to deliver gas to plants is really long and constrained,” adds Garren, highlighting administrative delays associated with fossil fuel plants.

As a result, Garren says that the combination of fossil fuel unattractiveness and the low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for solar means that large-scale solar deployment is the only viable option to meet growing electricity demand.

“Solar-plus-energy storage [and] solar-plus-wind, and energy efficiency and demand-side management – where you’re controlling customer demand at certain points – is getting to the place where it provides reliable 24-hour power,” says Garren.

“With that reality, and layering on the economics of solar being so cheap, as compared to any other energy resource, really, you are going to win in any open-source competition, for essentially any type of energy you need.”

Perhaps most strikingly, he suggests that utilities such as Georgia Power are actively working against these trends and the very spirit of competition by continuing to include fossil fuels in their IRPs.

“That is something that the Georgia Power IRP skews away from, open competition, because they want to put their finger on the scale for fossil generation.”

Shifting responsibility from the federal to state governments

With the impracticalities of fossil fuel plants clear, particularly in relation to solar projects, Garren suggests that the political climate of the US is driving utilities towards an otherwise surprising level of support for fossil fuel projects.

“This is an example of what we’re seeing nationwide, unfortunately, that is particularly in Republican-led states, there is a lot of political pressure to support expansion of fossil fuels and increased dependence on fossil fuels, flowing from this federal administration on down to the state level,” he says.

Much of this stems from the president himself, whose “drill, baby, drill” rhetoric has led to significant policy shifts to disadvantage clean energy projects, most notably in the form of shortened timelines for projects to receive tax credits once guaranteed by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Even without this federal-level political context, the RMI spokesperson notes that regulatory frameworks often used by utilities are “a barrier to building the smarter, cleaner, more affordable systems,” suggesting that there are administrative delays, as well as political ones, to shifting to a greater reliance on renewable energy in state-level IRPs.

However, Garren notes that this situation grants individual states greater responsibility for setting their own energy agendas, and while this has proven damaging to the clean energy transition in Georgia, there are examples of other states whose IRPs encourage a greater reliance on clean power.

“If you look at a place like Texas, which is largely skewed towards very open-source [energy generation] – ‘whatever resource can provide what we need, we’ll go with that’ – we’re talking about the fastest-growing renewable energy market in the country,” he explains, calling Texas a “shining example” of how a state government can embrace a technology-agnostic approach to energy policy, and one where the more favourable economics of renewable energy in general, and solar in particular, are evident.

Indeed, Texas’ commitment to its solar sector is well-known, boasting the most new solar capacity additions among the US states in 2024. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) expects the addition of a staggering 37.6GW of new solar capacity in the next five years – again the most in the US – and notes that close to US$60 billion has been invested in the state’s solar sector.

Steps towards the next IRP

Garren suggests that much of the reluctance to include more renewable power in a state’s IRP comes from the risk associated with tinkering with an energy mix that has, historically, relied heavily on fossil fuels.

“There’s a certain risk to doing something that feels new and innovative, like building a programme that uses 100 local solar projects instead of one massive gas plant, and I think that decision-makers are nervous about taking risks at a time in which they know that people’s bills are going to go up,” he says, suggesting that fear of being blamed for rising bill prices is affecting utilities’ decision-making.

“Even if it was a way to save people money, the challenge is you’re so afraid of getting blamed for rising rates that you tend to be reticent to take risks,” Garren ads.

However, he also suggests that the business model used by a number of utilities does not necessarily align with greater renewable energy deployment. A single centralised grid system, where a single operator is responsible for, and profiting from, grid expansion and project approval, is fundamentally different to, say several residential solar-plus-storage systems providing power generation and grid-balancing services, each on a much smaller scale.

“The reality is that building lots of big wires to connect these projects [and] investing in fossil generation that you’re going to operate for the rest of its life are all part of the utility business model that make them a great deal of money,” says Garren.

“Running a more efficient system that needs less wires [and] involves more private customers and developers that are offering different, innovative solutions is an exciting future for us as ratepayers, but it’s a daunting future for utilities that have a very cushy business model now, and are not interested in changing it.”

This has been particularly evident in California in recent weeks, where the California Solar and Storage Association (CALSSA) has called for fines to be levied against two utilities operating in the state for not reaching approval decisions on solar and storage projects within their targeted timeframes.

Speaking at the time, Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager for CALSSA, suggested that the utilities’ business models are so threatened by the growing storage industry, in particular, in California that they see local storage projects as a direct competitor to their commercial interests, and that they are able to “get away with suppressing what they consider to be their competition”.

Ultimately, with states granted more autonomy in setting their energy policies, separating those states’ utilities from older business models that incentivise fossil fuel deployment, and reforming grids to make better use of renewable and distributed energy sources, could yield positive results in the future.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/origis.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 13:00:39.768082

Researchers in China found a way to fix a major flaw in powerful next-gen batteries called lithium-metal batteries. These batteries typically fail fast because of tiny, spiky crystals called dendrites.

Think of these dendrites like damaging rust that grows inside the battery, short-circuiting it and dramatically shortening its life. But the researchers discovered that adding a common amino acid, L-cysteine, acts like a protective shield, effectively preventing this damaging growth from ever starting.

The results are a big deal. The study, published in the journal National Science Review, found that this simple addition ""achieves a 10-times increase in the cycling lifespan"" of the battery.

To put that in perspective, if a current battery lasts for just a few hundred charge cycles, this new technology could push that number into the thousands. For an EV driver, that could mean a battery that lasts for years longer than current models, saving a lot of money on expensive replacements.

This discovery is part of a bigger push happening everywhere. Other scientists are looking at different additives, with one experiment using a key ingredient in sugar to improve battery life. Meanwhile, some companies are creating entirely new designs, like solid-state batteries that remove the flammable liquid altogether for added safety. It's all leading to real-world progress that you can see today; some new EVs can already add 300 miles of range in just 20 minutes.

A better battery isn't just about convenience; it's about making clean energy more practical. A longer-lasting EV helps your wallet and makes it easier to move away from gas cars, which means cleaner air and healthier communities.

That clean energy journey can even start on your own roof. When you're ready, installing solar panels at home means you can generate your own power, bringing your EV charging costs down to almost nothing and protecting your budget from unpredictable energy prices.

EV nickel demand maintaining compound annual growth rates of 12-15% through 2030 anchors long-term investment conviction despite current cyclical pressures.
Long-term structural trends supporting EV growth remain intact, with global EV sales projected to represent half of all vehicle sales by 2035.","The expiration of the US $7,500 EV tax credit on September 30, 2025 will immediately reduce affordability for middle-class EV buyers, slowing adoption rates.

This policy shift is expected to weaken near-term Class 1 nickel demand, the critical input for high-energy-density NMC and NCA battery chemistries.

Nickel markets are already under stress from a 198,000t surplus forecast in 2025, with inventories exceeding 230,000t and prices stuck near US$15,000/t.

High-cost operators, particularly HPAL projects requiring >US$18,000/t, face mounting margin pressures, while low-cost Class 1 producers in stable jurisdictions retain a strategic premium.

Canada Nickel’s Crawford Project exemplifies how large-scale, low-cost, ESG-aligned Class 1 supply in Canada could benefit once policy-driven volatility subsides and long-term EV demand growth resumes.

September 2025 Policy Shift & Immediate Market Implications

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit represents a material policy inflection point for battery metal markets. The ""One Big Beautiful"" spending bill, signed into law on July 4, 2025, formally ended the US$7,500 per vehicle rebate that served as a cornerstone of the Inflation Reduction Act's consumer incentive framework. This policy reversal disproportionately affects middle-class consumers who relied on these incentives to bridge affordability gaps in EV purchases.

The immediate consequence is straightforward: reduced EV sales volumes translate directly into lower Class 1 nickel consumption. High-energy-density batteries powering premium EVs require nickel-intensive chemistries like NMC and NCA, where Class 1 nickel comprises the primary input for cathode materials. Without the tax credit, EV price premiums over internal combustion engine vehicles widen significantly, creating demand elasticity pressure precisely when the market can least absorb it.

Beyond direct sales impact, the policy shift undermines confidence in charging infrastructure investment and broader EV supply chain development. Private capital allocation decisions for battery manufacturing, charging networks, and related infrastructure projects now face heightened uncertainty regarding the pace of US EV adoption. This policy-driven demand destruction compounds existing structural oversupply pressures that have already pushed nickel prices to multi-year lows.

Dollar Strength, Inflation & Commodity Pressure

The Federal Reserve maintains tight monetary policy amid persistent inflation, with headline Consumer Price Index readings at 2.7% and core CPI at 2.9%. Robust employment data has effectively eliminated market expectations for rate cuts in both July and September 2025, reinforcing the likelihood of prolonged higher rates. This ""higher-for-longer"" stance supports continued dollar strength, which depresses demand for dollar-denominated commodities like nickel by making them more expensive for international buyers.

Higher financing costs simultaneously squeeze producer working capital and increase inventory carrying costs. For nickel producers already operating near breakeven levels, elevated borrowing costs compound margin pressures and accelerate potential shutdowns among marginal operations.

Persistent Oversupply & Inventory Build

Indonesia continues expanding nickel output despite periodic quota discussions, leveraging its dominant position in the global supply chain. Combined London Metal Exchange and Shanghai Futures Exchange inventories surpassed 230,000 metric tons by mid-2025, representing a substantial increase from previous years. The International Nickel Study Group projects a surplus of approximately 198,000 tons in 2025, while S&P Global analysis corroborates this oversupply outlook.

Current pricing near US$15,000 per tonne reflects multi-year lows, with brief periods in early 2025 touching levels not observed since 2020. This pricing environment has already forced approximately 32% of global production capacity offline, yet oversupply persists due to continued expansion in low-cost Indonesian operations.

Compounding Effects

The convergence of policy-driven demand reduction, structural oversupply, and persistent dollar strength creates sustained downward pricing pressure that extends beyond typical cyclical patterns. Investor sentiment has turned increasingly defensive, with institutional capital focusing on cost curve durability and jurisdictional resilience rather than growth-oriented metrics. This fundamental shift in risk assessment prioritizes operational sustainability over expansion potential in current market conditions.

Class 1 Nickel Demand in the EV Supply Chain

Class 1 nickel, with purity exceeding 99.8%, serves as the critical input for nickel-intensive battery chemistries that define premium EV performance. NMC and NCA batteries dominate high-range electric vehicles, offering superior energy density that enables longer driving ranges while reducing weight and footprint constraints. These nickel-intensive formulations are projected to constitute nearly 1,320 megawatt-hours of battery capacity by 2030, representing approximately 80% of forecasted EV lithium-ion battery applications.

Battery-grade nickel demand from the EV sector is expected to exceed 50% of total Class 1 consumption by 2027, fundamentally altering traditional demand patterns historically dominated by stainless steel applications. This structural shift toward battery applications carries compound annual growth rate projections of 12-15% through 2030, assuming continued EV adoption momentum.

Substitution & Technology Risk

The increasing market penetration of lithium iron phosphate batteries introduces nickel intensity uncertainty across EV segments. LFP batteries, which contain no nickel, are gaining share in lower-cost EV segments due to improved energy density and cost advantages. This substitution trend reduces overall nickel content per vehicle in certain market segments, creating long-term demand elasticity concerns that compound near-term policy-driven headwinds.

Technology evolution in battery chemistry continues to influence nickel intensity calculations, with manufacturers balancing energy density requirements against cost optimization and supply chain security considerations. These technological transitions introduce additional uncertainty layers beyond policy-driven demand fluctuations.

Global Policy Contrast

China accounts for 63.5% of global nickel demand in 2025, with government strategic stockpiling programs leveraging current low prices to bolster reserves. Chinese ""anti-rat race"" competition policies provide temporary price support, while strategic stockpiling creates demand floors during oversupply periods. Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act explicitly prioritizes supply from allied nations, creating jurisdictional bifurcation in pricing and investment flows.

The contrast between sustained support in China and Europe versus US policy volatility underscores the fragmented nature of global EV policy coordination. While Chinese and European demand may partially offset US reduction, the scale of the American market makes policy-driven demand destruction material for global nickel consumption calculations.

Economics & Cost Curve Stress

Current pricing near US$15,000 per tonne has rendered approximately 32% of global nickel production capacity uneconomical, forcing widespread operational suspensions and mine closures. High-Pressure Acid Leaching projects, which typically require nickel prices above US$18,000 per tonne to generate positive cash flows, face particularly acute margin pressures. Recent shutdowns in Kosovo and the Dominican Republic illustrate the immediate impact of sustained low pricing on marginal operations.

‍

The cost curve compression affects both mining and processing operations, with integrated producers maintaining slight advantages over standalone operations. Working capital constraints intensify as producers face inventory write-downs and reduced cash generation from core operations.

Industry Consolidation Outlook

Prolonged low-price environments historically accelerate industry consolidation through distressed asset acquisitions and strategic combinations. Current market conditions favor well-capitalized, low-cost operators positioned to acquire complementary assets at attractive valuations. This consolidation process typically eliminates marginal capacity while concentrating production among financially resilient operators.

Merger and acquisition activity is expected to intensify as private equity and strategic acquirers target distressed assets with strong fundamental characteristics but challenged near-term economics. Jurisdictional considerations increasingly influence transaction structures and valuations.

Jurisdictional Bifurcation

Western-aligned jurisdictions, particularly Canada and Australia, command increasing premiums among institutional investors focused on supply chain security and ESG compliance. The Inflation Reduction Act and EU Critical Raw Materials Act explicitly incentivize sourcing from allied nations, creating sustained demand premiums for compliant producers.

Conversely, Indonesia's consolidation of global supply positions it as the ""OPEC of nickel,"" with increasing ability to influence global pricing through production management. This geopolitical concentration introduces supply security concerns for Western end-users, reinforcing the strategic value of diversified sourcing from allied jurisdictions.

Mark Selby, Chief Executive Officer of Canada Nickel, observes this dynamic:

""Indonesia is starting to flex its muscle as the OPEC of nickel, which creates opportunities for strategic Class 1 producers in stable jurisdictions like Canada to serve Western supply chains seeking alternatives to concentrated Asian supply""

Market Positioning

Canada Nickel's Crawford Project exemplifies this positioning as the world's second-largest nickel reserve and resource, designed specifically for Class 1 nickel production serving battery applications. The project demonstrates compelling economics with a Net Present Value of US$2.8 billion at an 8% discount rate and an Internal Rate of Return of 17.6%, maintaining viability even under current depressed pricing conditions.

The Crawford operation targets C1 cash costs of US$0.68 per pound with All-In Sustaining Costs of US$1.54 per pound, positioning it among the global cost curve leaders. These metrics provide substantial margin buffers against current pricing volatility while supporting long-term cash generation potential.

Environmental & Development Strategy

Environmental differentiation increasingly matters for Western supply chains, with carbon-negative production capabilities commanding premiums among ESG-focused end-users. Canada Nickel's NetZero Metals initiative aims to deliver carbon-negative nickel production through In-Process Tailings Carbonation technology, potentially sequestering up to 1.5 million tonnes of CO₂ annually. This environmental positioning aligns with increasing ESG requirements among Western battery manufacturers and automotive original equipment manufacturers.

Development execution remains critical during prolonged low-price cycles, with successful operators maintaining project momentum despite challenging market conditions. Near-term development catalysts for Crawford include Front End Engineering Design completion in March 2025, Environmental Impact Statement finalization with federal permits expected by Fall 2025, and production targeting for 2027-2028. The company's ability to advance from fifth drill hole to federal permitting in under six years demonstrates execution capabilities in a challenging regulatory environment.

Strategic Funding & District Scale

Strategic funding arrangements reduce traditional equity dilution concerns that plague many development-stage mining companies during capital-intensive construction phases. Crawford benefits from US$600 million in refundable tax credits from the Canadian government, Samsung SDI's option to acquire 10% with US$100 million funding, and US$500 million Letter of Interest from Export Development Canada as Mandated Lead Arranger. This diversified funding structure positions the project for construction decision without significant shareholder dilution.

District-scale opportunities provide additional strategic value through resource base expansion and operational leverage. Mark Selby, Chief Executive Officer of Canada Nickel, emphasizes this potential:

""Having the kind of district scale which will make Timmins the largest nickel sulfide district in the world, and then being able to take what we build at Crawford and simply cut and paste it four or five times to build what should and could be the world's largest nickel sulfide district production wise, bigger than what Norilsk produces, bigger than what Jinchuan produces today""

The broader Timmins Nickel District encompasses nine separate resources, with the Mann West deposit alone containing over one billion tons with 2 million tons of contained nickel and nearly one million ounces of platinum group metals.

Operational Advantages

Infrastructure advantages matter significantly for operational cost structures, particularly in established mining jurisdictions with existing supplier networks and workforce capabilities. Crawford's strategic positioning in Ontario leverages established mining infrastructure, local supplier networks, and residential workforce capabilities that contribute to operational cost advantages. The proximity to existing communities within an hour's drive enables a residential workforce model that enhances productivity while reducing operational complexity.

The Investment Thesis for Nickel

Policy-driven demand adjustments, exemplified by the September 2025 US EV credit expiry, create near-term headwinds for nickel consumption while leaving structural growth trajectories intact. EV nickel demand maintaining compound annual growth rates of 12-15% through 2030 anchors long-term investment conviction despite current cyclical pressures.

Cost curve pressures disproportionately affect HPAL and marginal producers, accelerating industry consolidation that favors low-cost, well-capitalized operators with strategic positioning. This consolidation process typically eliminates excess capacity while concentrating production among financially resilient players.

Jurisdictional premiums for allied-nation Class 1 supply continue expanding as Western governments prioritize supply chain security through explicit policy incentives. The Inflation Reduction Act and EU Critical Raw Materials Act create sustained demand premiums for compliant producers in stable jurisdictions.

Strategic investment opportunities emerge from the convergence of cyclical pricing pressure and structural demand growth, particularly for ESG-compliant Class 1 producers positioned to serve Western battery supply chains. Canada Nickel exemplifies how large-scale, low-cost, carbon-negative Class 1 supply in stable jurisdictions benefits from long-term structural demand despite near-term policy volatility.

Risk-adjusted positioning favors producers with demonstrated cost competitiveness, jurisdictional advantages, and strategic alignment with Western supply chain security objectives, while maintaining caution regarding high-cost operations exposed to prolonged pricing pressure and geopolitical supply concentration risks.

Policy Inflection & Investor Positioning

The September 2025 EV tax credit expiry illustrates how fiscal policy directly influences commodity demand trajectories, creating immediate market implications that extend beyond traditional supply-demand fundamentals. Near-term pressure on US EV adoption will compound existing oversupply conditions, maintaining downward pricing pressure on Class 1 nickel in an already challenged market environment.

Long-term structural trends supporting EV growth remain intact, with global EV sales projected to represent half of all vehicle sales by 2035. The current policy-driven adjustment period, combined with persistent oversupply, creates cyclical entry opportunities for sophisticated investors willing to navigate short-term volatility in pursuit of structural positioning advantages.

Jurisdictional bifurcation increasingly favors secure, ESG-compliant Class 1 supply from allied nations, creating sustained competitive advantages for strategically positioned producers like Canada Nickel's Crawford Project. Investors must balance near-term policy uncertainty against long-term positioning opportunities as markets undergo fundamental restructuring toward supply chain security and carbon intensity reduction objectives.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64523461a75e4b406281bdba/68b4499a3e9c24345f7983ad_ev.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:03:31.943535

Alex Dews is CEO of the Institute for Market Transformation. Opinions are the author’s own.

Since 2000 the United States has grown by 60 million people while GDP has expanded by 170%, yet energy consumption has stayed relatively flat. How did we do that? In part, we made buildings more efficient.

With electricity demand surging, especially from data centers and the growth in artificial intelligence, there is increasing concern over how to meet our power needs while balancing grid resilience, affordability and climate impacts. The supply side of this equation tends to get more attention than the demand side of the equation. How do we get more energy generation across the finish line?

But that’s not a fully informed way to look at the issue; it’s on the demand side that we can make an immediate difference, because increasing energy efficiency in buildings is a proven, scalable solution to both energy affordability and decarbonization. The bottom line is that, for significantly lower cost than new power generation, we can meet a large part of energy demand through improved building energy efficiency and energy use time shifts.

Buildings’ role in energy infrastructure

Buildings use nearly 75% of U.S. electricity and more than a third of natural gas. A McKinsey study, “Powering a new era of US energy demand,” leads with a graphic showing that buildings comprise the majority of demand, but the study does not mention buildings in its analysis or proposed solutions. Similarly, as the federal government wipes out clean energy investments, talk about climate action in this new context largely ignores the role of buildings. A recent episode of the Ezra Klein Show, entitled “Is Decarbonization Dead?” mentions buildings exactly zero times even though they are the largest single end-user of energy.

As many as 8 in ten buildings that will be in use 25 years from now are already built, and the EPA estimates that 30% of the energy used in commercial buildings today is wasted. Older buildings, in particular, represent a huge amount of overall energy use, and a major untapped opportunity to reduce demand.

Of course, supply-side discussions matter because the fuels we use to generate energy offer starkly different paths forward. We can take the path of investing in clean technology that reduces air pollution and helps mitigate the worst effects of climate change. Alternatively, we can prop up fossil fuels at great cost to our physical health and financial well-being. In addition to dirtier air, utility customers may be stuck with the bill for stranded assets if AI turns out to be a market bubble.

But demand determines how much energy we need to produce. In essence, energy efficiency should be thought of as a demand-side infrastructure solution. Greater demand raises prices for all fuel types, and it makes power outages more likely. If there’s one thing everyone agrees on, it’s that we don’t want blackouts while waiting for more power to come online.

Addressing affordability and decarbonization

For a fraction of the cost, time and difficulty of adding new power plants, we can improve the way our buildings use energy. In less than a year, building efficiency and demand flexibility — like pre-cooling buildings on summer days — can make a difference in lowering electric demand, improving affordability and keeping the lights on. By contrast, new transmission lines and power plants typically take more than a decade for design, permitting and construction.

Energy use by the building sector has remained relatively flat for the last 20 years, even while adding more square footage and electric devices. That’s because building codes and appliance standards continually improve, making newly constructed buildings more efficient.

Efficient buildings cost less to run, ­­and with smart lease structures, both the landlord and tenant can benefit. Efficient buildings are also more valuable. Six academic studies found that ENERGY STAR certified buildings earn a 5-16% rental premium, a 6-13% sales price premium and 3-6% higher occupancy.

Furthermore, upgrading less-efficient buildings creates local jobs that can’t be outsourced. These jobs can be done by people with a range of skills and experience. Policymakers can intentionally grow these jobs in areas with limited opportunities and target job training to those residents. In 2024, there were2,290,179 energy efficiency jobs contributing to the U.S. economy, constituting the majority of jobs in the clean energy sector and outnumbering all fossil fuel extraction and processing jobs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

For anyone who cares about climate action, buildings are critical. In many urban communities, buildings represent 50%-75% of greenhouse gas emissions. That means there is simply no way to meet climate goals without reducing building energy use. And unlike clean energy, most policies that influence building energy efficiency are passed and implemented by states and localities, making them less vulnerable to changes in federal incentives. More than 50 jurisdictions have benchmarking laws that require building owners to track their energy use and 15 have passed building performance standards that set energy reduction targets.

Policymakers should engage both real estate professionals and residents in efforts to improve buildings’ energy efficiency, creating opportunities for greater civic engagement and discussion about the future each community wants to create. Building energy code advancements have been powerful tools for improving newly constructed buildings. Building performance standards, which drive upgrades to existing buildings, have the potential to reduce energy use dramatically. The National Building Performance Standards Coalition is a group of 49 local and state governments committed to passing such policies. If all members of this coalition adopted BPS policies, the energy savings by 2040 could eliminate the need for more than 100 gas power plants.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IxAsZD6Cx2igjs5ABf6sXmCGfqg2F8N9fQHOXi3SL0k/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDY4Mzk2NzY2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-12 13:00:55.622159

TEMISKAMING SHORES, Ontario, September 12, 2025 – Electra Battery Materials is planning to invest nearly $100 million to establish a battery-grade cobalt sulfate refinery in Temiskaming Shores, Ontario. The refinery will be the first of its kind in North America, filling an important gap in the province’s critical mineral and battery supply chains.

Cobalt sulfate is a key input for lithium-ion batteries used across clean technology applications from electric vehicles to large-scale energy storage. This project will expand Ontario’s critical mineral processing capacity and reduce the reliance on imported materials in battery manufacturing.

We are focused on completing North America’s first cobalt sulfate refinery and unlocking the jobs and economic activity that come with it. We are grateful for the support from Invest Ontario, which will help accelerate construction and reinforces confidence in the strategic importance of our project. Establishing a domestic supply of battery-grade cobalt is essential to reducing reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains, safeguarding economic and energy security, and ensuring that Canada plays a leading role in the global energy transition.

Trent Mell

CEO of Electra

Northern Ontario is home to abundant deposits of nickel, lithium, platinum, cobalt and other strategically important raw materials. This vast mineral wealth feeds into a world-class advanced manufacturing sector in the south, making Ontario a natural destination for projects like Electra’s.

Under the leadership of Premier Ford, our government is building a strong, self-reliant economy that integrates Northern Ontario’s vast mineral wealth with Southern Ontario’s manufacturing might. Electra’s investment in Temiskaming Shores will establish an integral link in the province’s critical mineral processing supply chains and fuel the next stages of Ontario’s leadership in electric vehicle battery manufacturing.

Hon. Vic Fedeli

Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade

Subject to reaching a definitive agreement, the investment will be supported with a loan of up to $17.5 million through the Invest Ontario Fund.

Critical minerals are key to securing Ontario’s leadership in clean energy technologies, and advancing their development and processing is a priority for us. Once operational, Electra’s refinery will mark a significant step towards the province’s goal of building a complete, made-in-Ontario critical mineral supply chain.

These programs are part of DOE’s broader strategy to advance American energy independence and scientific leadership by enabling the development of fusion energy technologies on U.S. soil.

Fusion innovation research engine (FIRE) collaboratives

The DOE is awarding $128 million to seven research teams through the FIRE Collaboratives. These virtual, centrally managed teams aim to build an innovation ecosystem focused on fusion energy science and technology. The goal is to close the gap between basic scientific research in fusion and the growing demands of the commercial fusion energy industry.

The FIRE Collaboratives are designed to complement the DOE’s Fusion Energy Sciences (FES) program with private-sector innovation. By doing this, the program aims to accelerate the translation of fusion science breakthroughs into practical, scalable technologies that could lead to the development of commercial fusion power plants.

The DOE expects to invest up to $220 million in total funding for FIRE over four years. The current $31 million allocation is for Fiscal Year 2025, with future funding subject to congressional approval.

Innovation network for fusion energy (INFUSE)

In addition to the FIRE Collaboratives, the DOE is providing $6.1 million to fund 20 projects through the INFUSE program. This initiative is specifically designed to reduce barriers to collaboration between private companies and DOE’s national labs or academic institutions.

The INFUSE program supports projects in various technical areas that are crucial to fusion energy development. These include materials science, laser technology, high-temperature superconducting magnets, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for modelling and simulation. The program also focuses on enabling technologies needed to reduce costs and improve the feasibility of commercial fusion energy.

Each INFUSE project receives between $100,000 and $500,000 and is selected through a competitive peer-review process. Leadership teams at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory manage the program.

Advancing fusion as a viable energy source

Fusion energy promises to replicate the same process that powers the sun, potentially providing a near-limitless, clean, and reliable energy source. Unlike current nuclear power, fusion does not produce long-lived radioactive waste and carries a much lower risk of catastrophic failure.

The Energy Act of 2020 laid the foundation for DOE to pursue stronger public-private partnerships in fusion. Both the FIRE and INFUSE programs reflect this direction, supporting not only scientific innovation but also American manufacturing, energy security, and national defence.

While selections have been announced, funding will only be finalised after negotiations between DOE and the selected applicants. The agency reserves the right to cancel negotiations or rescind selections at any time during the process.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/iStock-2160790660-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 12:04:47.320083

He plans to become an approved vendor under Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, and develop residential arrays for the many friends and acquaintances who have asked him about solar.","At 15, Kyle Barber started working at the Captain coal mine in southern Illinois — ​“following in the footsteps of my forefathers,” he says.

It was 1996, and the mine was closing, so his job involved swinging sledgehammers and scrambling down dangerously steep hillsides to retrieve huge rolls of discarded chain-link fence. He knew this was not the industry he wanted to spend his life working in.

Barber had long been fascinated by clean energy; he even won a grade school contest designing a solar canopy to go over highways. After graduating from college, he connected with the southern Illinois solar company AES to learn the trade, and in 2010 founded his own solar company, EFS. In 2017, he began teaching in a solar workforce training program in Peoria, Illinois, that was created by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA), which went into effect that same year.

Now, Barber is spreading the gospel of solar from the Scott Bibb Center at Lewis and Clark Community College in the southwestern Illinois city of Alton, on the banks of the Mississippi River. It’s one of 14 clean energy jobs hubs created by the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), successor to FEJA. And it shows how even in the wake of dire federal cuts to clean energy programs, a well-funded and thoughtfully implemented state program can foster a robust transition to renewables on the local level.

Barber has been on the faculty at Lewis and Clark since February 2020, originally teaching classes on solar through a program funded by the U.S. Department of Energy. After the pandemic, Barber saw interest in the solar training program surge. CEJA allowed the school to bolster its offerings with wraparound social services and basic education, helping a wider range of students overcome barriers and prepare for careers in the industry.

With one of his former students, Richie Darling, Barber cofounded a nonprofit, Solar Workforce Development, to teach courses on solar installation, marketing, technology, and other aspects of the business at CEJA workforce hubs and elsewhere around the state, including Richland Community College in Decatur, where leaders are pinning their hopes on electric vehicle manufacturing.

Darling was this summer named manager of the Alton CEJA hub based at Lewis and Clark. Barber teaches classes there and also owns the residential and commercial solar company BKJ, having sold his interest in EFS.

Another of Barber’s proteges, Austin Frank, founded a solar company called ARF that installed a 100-kilowatt array on the Bibb Center roof. Thanks to federal and state incentives and labor donated by Frank’s company, the system cost the school nothing and saves the institution about $5,000 a month in energy bills, covering 40% of the building’s energy, he said. Frank has hired multiple graduates from Lewis and Clark.

“It all starts with Kyle,” said Darling. ​“It’s like vertical integration. We’re training people in solar, getting contractors set up, and then we have solar on the roof.”

Transitioning from coal

For six decades, residents of Alton breathed pollution from the nearby Wood River coal plant. The plant closed in 2016, taking around 90 jobs with it, and the facility was spectacularly imploded in 2021. Clean energy advocates have proposed a solar farm be built on the site.

Alton was founded more than 200 years ago at the confluence of the Mississippi, Illinois, and Missouri rivers. The city was once a booming industrial and commercial center, but its fortunes have declined as has its population, which now hovers near 25,000, though a smattering of trendy breweries, restaurants, and antique stores attract visitors from the St. Louis area and beyond.

The college qualified to be a workforce training hub under CEJA because the Alton area is home to a closed coal plant and because the state has deemed that the community was historically excluded from economic opportunities. CEJA prioritizes job creation and clean energy deployment in such spots, to make sure the clean energy transition benefits those who were harmed by or left out of the fossil fuel economy.

Advocates applauded the law’s impact at a celebration of the Alton hub at Lewis and Clark last month. ​“Now because of CEJA,” said Francisco Lopez Zavala, climate policy program associate of the Illinois Environmental Council, hubs like the community college ​“are helping to build Illinois’s clean energy future, which in turn makes our air easier to breathe, our communities healthier, and our grid more resilient.”

Under CEJA, students are paid to take the clean energy and related basic skills courses. At Lewis and Clark, students can choose from four tracks: solar, energy efficiency, HVAC/ heat pumps, and a Climate Works pre-apprenticeship program affiliated with labor unions. Since launching last fall, the school’s program has graduated 57 students in 10 cohorts — five focused on solar, one on energy efficiency, one on HVAC, and three in pre-apprenticeship. Ninety-five percent of enrolled students have graduated, and eight companies, including ARF, have already hired graduates.

CEJA also sets aside money to reduce barriers for students, who can apply for funding for everything from car repairs and bus passes to electric bills and child care. This opportunity lasts for a full year after graduation. Each hub has a navigator organization that administers the aid; in Alton’s case, that’s Senior Services Plus, a social service agency that helps people of all ages.

During the August event, current students enthused about the program and the opportunities it creates. In one of the HVAC classes, Michael Mahon Jr. said he wants to set a good example for his daughter, and John Bone said he wants to solve the problems of greenhouse gases and ozone.

Chase Ellinger said that he is excited about the chance for a real career after bouncing between minimum-wage jobs in warehouses, bars, and landscaping. ​“I want to make a better world and contribute to something for real,” he added.

Other students were learning how to build energy-efficient tiny houses in a workshop on the college grounds.

Up on the roof of the Bibb Center, Frank’s employees were installing the latest addition to the solar array. Frank started his career in construction, working with his father. After a number of customers asked them about solar, ​“we were like, ​‘Holy cow, this is the next big thing. We’ve got to get educated,’” Frank said. He enrolled in Lewis and Clark’s solar training program before it was funded by CEJA.

Following his graduation, he founded ARF Solar in 2021 and became an approved vendor for the Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All programs created by FEJA and expanded by CEJA. Illinois Shines provides incentives for residential, commercial, and community solar, and Illinois Solar for All offers even more robust support for deploying solar in lower-income or environmental justice areas and hiring employees who meet equity-focused criteria.

ARF has installed systems on fire stations and other municipal buildings around southern Illinois, as well as schools and churches. Frank is also hoping to branch into community solar, which allows individuals to subscribe for access to energy from a shared array.

“The state had my back,” Frank said. ​“It created a program for small contractors like myself to come in and have a safe space where we’re able to grow.”

Opening doors

People with criminal records are among those prioritized for CEJA’s equity-minded incentives, and at Lewis and Clark, multiple students and graduates said the solar training could provide a crucial job opportunity especially given barriers they’ve faced due to their pasts.

“I come from a background of poverty, addiction, and mental illness. I didn’t have anyone to teach me how to do life things,” program graduate Taryn Sensmeyer told visitors. ​“By the time I found recovery, I had created a lot more barriers to entry,” including ​“my colorful criminal history.”

She heard about the program from a friend who described it as ​“this weird thing you are totally going to love,” and she said the friend was right.

“I thought I’d just be showing up to learn how to install solar panels, but I got comprehensive knowledge of the whole industry and a deep passion for the environment.”

She’s now participating in an apprenticeship that will prepare her to become a journeyman electrician.

“For the first time, I can put food on the table without any outside help,” Sensmeyer said. ​“It’s had a ripple effect on everyone I come in contact with.”

Zachary Resmann, a current student in Barber’s class, grew up on an Illinois dairy farm and worked in solar sales. But he felt he was being taken advantage of by out-of-state solar companies flocking to the Illinois market to cash in on incentives, especially for community solar. He joined the CEJA program in hopes of becoming a contractor himself, and his background qualifies him to tap into the law’s equity funds and services. He plans to become an approved vendor under Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, and develop residential arrays for the many friends and acquaintances who have asked him about solar.

“Solar power is power by the people for the people,” said Resmann, who founded the company Resolute Energy Solutions, which helps customers interested in solar, energy efficiency, and other services get quotes and connect with suppliers. ​“With four kids and a felony, it was hard to get hired. This has changed my life and given me hope.”

With such demand plus state incentives and training programs, Barber is confident the solar industry has strong prospects in Illinois, despite federal rollbacks.

“Under CEJA, there is truly no limit to the number of jobs, companies, projects we can create,” he told visitors to Lewis and Clark in August. ​“There is no magic; it’s just hard work and determination to create a cleaner and brighter future here in Illinois.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/IMG_1289.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=8b744f91f46c8bce9510c3207849d6c7,N,,2025-09-12 11:00:50.184368

Supported under ARENA’s Advancing Renewables Program, the initiative focuses on refining Daylight Photoluminescence (DL) imaging to detect panel faults, down to the individual cells, with greater precision and at lower costs.

In contrast to the current practice of performance monitoring through various methods like inverter-level current-voltage data, visual inspection, and other imaging techniques, this assessment will be easier to use than traditional approaches, explained ARENA.

While photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) tests are conducted in carefully designed, light-tight enclosures, Lab360’s DPL imaging technique reduces the need for heavy equipment and simplifies operations. It also scores over the other approach of night-time EL (nEL) imaging, the agency adds.

“This technology (Lab360 DPL imaging) has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and complexity of solar farm diagnostics. By spotting issues early and reducing the need for heavy equipment and associated labour, this innovation helps operators get the most out of their solar panels and supports Australia’s clean energy future,” said ARENA CEO Darren Miller.

Backed by ARENA, Lab360 plans to combine DPL hardware with a commercial drone and related software to create its final product. It has exclusive rights to key UNSW patents and aims to commercialize the technology through this project by developing better luminescence-based testing for large solar farms.

“Once rolled out commercially, first in Australia and then globally, it will be central to ensuring that photovoltaic panels are a reliable and sustainable cornerstone of the future energy mix, by enabling better monitoring, early fault detection and long-term performance of solar assets,” said Lab360 CEO Thorsten Trupke.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-09-12%2F8t8deibx%2FLab360.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-12 13:00:43.644061

Strategic Investment Details

TotalEnergies has inked agreements with NextDecade Corporation to acquire a 10% direct stake in the joint venture developing Train 4 of the Rio Grande LNG (RGLNG) facility, strategically positioned in South Texas. Beyond this direct investment, the French energy major will hold an additional indirect stake of approximately 7% through its existing 17.1% shareholding in NextDecade, bringing its total exposure in Train 4 to around 17%.

The Final Investment Decision, reached in collaboration with NextDecade (holding 40%) and prominent partners including Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP, 36.9%), Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC (7.9%), and UAE’s Mubadala (5.2%), green-lights the development of the fourth liquefaction train with an estimated project cost exceeding $7 billion. The financing structure, comprising approximately 40% equity and 60% debt, reflects the industry’s confidence in long-term LNG demand fundamentals.

Expanding US LNG Footprint

This fourth train, boasting a substantial capacity of approximately 6 million tons per annum (Mtpa), will elevate the Rio Grande facility’s total capacity to an impressive 24 Mtpa upon commissioning in 2030. For context, this expansion positions Rio Grande LNG among the largest LNG export facilities globally, competing directly with established players like Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass and Cameron LNG terminals.

“We are very pleased with the FID of RGLNG Train 4. This project from which we will offtake 1.5 Mtpa strengthens our LNG export capacity from the United States,” commented Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies. “It gives TotalEnergies access to competitive LNG thanks to its low production costs.”

The significance of this investment becomes clearer when examining TotalEnergies’ broader US LNG strategy. The company’s involvement in Train 4 will boost its American LNG export capacity to over 16 Mtpa by 2030, substantially enhancing its ability to serve global markets while maintaining its impressive 10% worldwide market share.

Market Context and Competitive Landscape

The global LNG market has experienced unprecedented growth, with demand projected to increase by 3-4% annually through 2030. This surge is driven primarily by Asia-Pacific markets, where countries like China and India are transitioning from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas for power generation and industrial applications.

TotalEnergies’ strategic positioning comes at a critical juncture. The company currently ranks as the world’s third-largest LNG player, managing a global portfolio of 40 million tons annually in 2024. This places it behind industry leaders Shell and Qatar Energy but ahead of major competitors like Chevron and BP in terms of LNG trading volumes and integrated operations.

The Rio Grande project’s competitive advantages are particularly noteworthy. Located in South Texas, the facility benefits from direct access to the prolific Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale formations, ensuring abundant, low-cost feedstock supply. Additionally, the facility’s proximity to major shipping channels provides efficient access to both Atlantic and Pacific markets, a crucial factor in today’s geographically diverse LNG trade.

NextDecade Partnership Strengthens

Matt Schatzman, NextDecade’s Chairman and CEO, emphasized the strategic value of deepening the partnership with TotalEnergies: “We are pleased to have TotalEnergies, our largest LNG customer and equity partner for Phase 1 of Rio Grande LNG, extend their commitment to our project through Train 4. LNG exported by TotalEnergies from our project will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to customers around the world.”

This relationship extends beyond mere commercial arrangements. TotalEnergies previously secured a comprehensive Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with NextDecade for a 20-year offtake commitment of 1.5 Mtpa from Train 4, demonstrating long-term confidence in both the project’s viability and NextDecade’s operational capabilities.

The French energy giant’s existing involvement in Rio Grande LNG Phase 1 further underscores this commitment. TotalEnergies holds a 16.7% interest in the initial phase, which encompasses three liquefaction trains currently under construction, with commercial operations expected to commence in 2027. From Phase 1 alone, TotalEnergies will offtake 5.4 Mtpa, establishing Rio Grande as a cornerstone of its North American supply portfolio.

Global Energy Transition Implications

The investment aligns seamlessly with TotalEnergies’ broader energy transition strategy. The company has articulated ambitious plans to increase natural gas’s share in its sales mix to approximately 50% by 2030, positioning gas as a crucial bridge fuel in the global transition away from higher-carbon energy sources.

This strategic emphasis on natural gas reflects broader industry recognition of LNG’s role in reducing global carbon emissions, particularly in regions currently dependent on coal for power generation. Studies indicate that switching from coal to natural gas for electricity generation can reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 50%, making LNG a vital component of near-term decarbonization efforts.

TotalEnergies has committed to reducing carbon emissions across its operations while working to eliminate methane emissions associated with the entire gas value chain. The company’s partnership with NextDecade includes provisions for implementing advanced methane detection and reduction technologies at the Rio Grande facility, setting new industry standards for environmental performance.

Infrastructure and Logistics Advantages

The Rio Grande LNG facility’s strategic location offers significant logistical advantages that enhance its competitive positioning. Situated along the Port of Brownsville ship channel, the facility provides direct access to deep-water shipping lanes capable of accommodating the latest generation of ultra-large LNG carriers.

This infrastructure advantage becomes increasingly important as LNG shipping costs represent a significant component of delivered LNG prices. The facility’s location enables efficient access to key demand centers in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with typical voyage times of 15-20 days to major Asian markets and 7-10 days to European destinations.

Financial and Market Outlook

The LNG market’s robust fundamentals continue to attract substantial capital investment despite cyclical pricing volatility. Industry analysts project global LNG demand could reach 700-800 million tons annually by 2040, driven by ongoing coal-to-gas switching in developing economies and the fuel’s role as a backup for renewable energy systems.

TotalEnergies’ integrated approach across the LNG value chain positions it advantageously in this growing market. The company operates interests in liquefaction facilities across multiple geographic regions, maintains access to over 20 Mtpa of regasification capacity in Europe, and operates extensive trading and LNG bunkering operations.

Conclusion

TotalEnergies’ commitment to Rio Grande LNG Train 4 represents more than a strategic investment—it exemplifies the evolving dynamics of global energy security and the increasing importance of diversified supply chains. As the world navigates the complex transition toward cleaner energy systems, projects like Rio Grande LNG provide essential infrastructure for delivering reliable, lower-carbon energy to markets worldwide.

The project’s 2030 commissioning timeline positions it well to capture anticipated growth in global LNG demand while supporting TotalEnergies’ ambition to maintain and potentially expand its leadership position in the global LNG market. For NextDecade, the continued partnership with TotalEnergies validates its development strategy and provides crucial financial and operational support for one of America’s most ambitious LNG projects.

As global energy markets continue to evolve, strategic partnerships like this one between TotalEnergies and NextDecade will likely become increasingly important in developing the infrastructure necessary to meet growing global energy demand while supporting the transition to cleaner energy sources.

LIUNA members build and operate power plants for utilities across the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota Power.","The Trump administration’s targeting of clean energy is complicating the path to 100% clean electricity in northern Minnesota.

As of now, Minnesota electric utilities are on track to comply with a 2023 state law requiring them to sell only carbon-free power to customers by 2040. But the road ahead looks more challenging — and more expensive — thanks to Republicans’ rollback of several Biden-era efforts to accelerate the transition from polluting power plants.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed by President Donald Trump in July, eliminated or severely restricted hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants, loans and tax credits for renewable energy and other low- or zero-emission technologies. The administration has also effectively halted once-routine federal permitting for large-scale wind and solar projects and rescinded permits for some previously approved projects.

The federal turmoil comes at a particularly sensitive time for Minnesota Power, the investor-owned utility serving 150,000 customers across northern Minnesota.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission could vote as soon as next month on a proposed merger between Allete, the utility’s parent company, and an investment group led by a subsidiary of BlackRock, the private equity giant.

Earlier this year, BlackRock lost a $17 billion book of business with a Dutch pension fund that was concerned it wasn’t doing enough to address climate risk. At a news conference last week outside Allete’s downtown Duluth headquarters, DFL State Sen. Jen McEwen and environmental advocates questioned BlackRock’s sustainable bona fides, citing its extensive investments in heavy industry and fossil fuels.

Minnesota Power and its prospective buyers beg to differ. BlackRock and CPP Investments say they have committed nearly $5 billion toward Minnesota Power’s infrastructure plans — support the utility says it needs to meet the state’s carbon-free electricity mandate.

“Advancing the clean-energy future requires significant investment and the long-term, experienced investors we have chosen as partners will give us the access to capital needed for this energy transition,” Minnesota Power spokesperson Amy Rutledge told the Minnesota Reformer last month.

Skeptics say it’s far from certain that the buyers will make good on that promise. A judge warned in July that the new owners could pursue “financial engineering” that weakens the utility’s financial position and its transition plan. And Minnesota Power’s long-range strategy relies heavily on new wind power, the technology hurt most by recent federal policy changes. Meanwhile, the utility proposes adding enough new gas-fired generation to power several hundred thousand homes, a deficit it would need to make up through renewable energy purchases from outside its system — potentially at significant cost to ratepayers.

“We still think, for better or worse, that [wind and solar] will be the cheapest way to build new power generation … but the cheapest way to build new power generation will become more expensive, and that is highly inflationary,” Pete Wyckoff, Minnesota Department of Commerce deputy commissioner of energy resources, said in an interview.

Industrial growth could move the clean electricity goalposts

Minnesota Power already generates 50% to 60% of its power from wind, solar and hydroelectric facilities, up from just 5% in 2005. It aims to meet a state mandate for 80% clean energy by 2030 and hit 90% renewables while phasing out coal by 2035.

In a 15-year resource plan filed with the Public Utilities Commission this year, Minnesota Power proposed adding at least 400 megawatts of wind power and 100 megawatts of energy storage capacity to 700 megawatts of renewable resources already under development. The plan would also add about 1,000 megawatts of gas-fired capacity by 2030 and at least 100 megawatts of industrial demand response — paying energy-intensive customers to ramp down their loads when the grid is stressed.

If industrial customers like taconite mills, lumber processors or a possible data center in Hermantown push power demand higher than expected, Minnesota Power could add up to 1,800 megawatts of additional wind, 200 megawatts of additional energy storage and 200 megawatts of solar.

That “Growth Plan” could serve up to 1,100 megawatts of new load over the next decade-plus, the utility says.

Minnesota Power hasn’t said how much of that load could come from large-scale data centers, but Xcel Energy and the state’s largest wholesale electric cooperative say they expect up to 2,300 megawatts of new data center demand by the early 2030s. Data centers could consume as much 12% of U.S. electricity output in 2028, the U.S. Department of Energy said in December.

“We work closely with all our existing and new customer requests on their upcoming energy needs,” Julie Pierce, Minnesota Power vice president of strategy and planning, said in an email. “[We have] a long history of serving some of the largest industrial customers in the country and Northeast Minnesota would welcome additional industry to locate in this part of the state.”

Even if new industrial demand fails to materialize, Minnesota Power’s heavy reliance on wind power — and, to a lesser extent, solar — looks like a vulnerability these days.

President Trump routinely rails against “windmills,” which he blames for spoiling the view from a golf resort he owns in Scotland. Though he supportscarbon-free resources like nuclear and geothermal power, Energy Secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright is a hardened renewables skeptic who spouts blatant misinformation about solar power and has characterized wind power as a technology in decline despite double-digit global growth.

Minnesota Power is confident it can continue clean energy progress

If Pierce and her team worry that a hostile federal government could derail Minnesota Power’s energy transition plans, they’re not showing it.

“Implementation of new energy projects is a long journey and [we] have a history of navigating permitting and policy changes,” Pierce said.

Minnesota Power has enough capacity to serve customers in the near term and is “committed to meeting the requirements of the Minnesota 2040 law,” she added.

One question the utility will need to answer definitively in the coming years is what to do with the coal-fired Boswell Energy Center, its nearly 1,000-megawatt Iron Range workhorse. Its latest resource plan calls for adding an 85-megawatt solar array in the next few years, converting the smaller of its two operating units from coal to gas by 2030, and developing non-coal options for the larger unit by 2035.

That could mean a range of “firm” carbon-free power sources, such as enhanced geothermal, gas with carbon capture technology, long-duration energy storage and advanced nuclear, Minnesota Power says.

Utilities elsewhere are bullish on small modular reactors, which proponents say are safer and cheaper to deploy than conventional large reactors like those at Xcel’s Prairie Island and Monticello power plants. Boswell is one of hundreds of aging coal power plants in the United States, most of which the U.S. Department of Energy says could feasibly host small nuclear reactors.

“Minnesota Power supports an all-of-the-above energy strategy and is pleased to see the progress being made [on small reactors] … we look forward to learning more as the critical first implementations of this technology are completed,” Pierce said.

Efforts to lift Minnesota’s moratorium on nuclear power development face an uphill climb in the state legislature. The biggest hang-up is the complicated legacy of the “temporary” nuclear waste storage facility on the Prairie Island Indian Community’s doorstep that has effectively become permanent.

State leaders who otherwise support clean energy are skeptical that advanced nuclear will help Minnesota utilities decarbonize by 2040. The most recent U.S. commercial nuclear project took more than a decade to build and ended up billions of dollars over budget, DFL Rep. Larry Kraft noted in an interview.

“Even if things go well, it’s not going to help us for 10 years, and we need to largely decarbonize by then,” Kraft said. “People place too much emphasis on that discussion.”

All roads run through North Dakota?

Among the dozens of Trump administration executive actions that could complicate Minnesota Power’s path is a sweeping July order that requires Interior Secretary and former North Dakota governor Doug Burgum to personally approve permit applications on federal lands. Experts say the order is broad enough to hinder many projects on private lands.

Bergum’s home state got 36% of its electricity from wind in 2023. It’s home to much of Minnesota Power’s existing renewables, which power Minnesota via a 465-mile transmission line. North Dakota is also where the utility hopes to energize a new, 200-megawatt wind farm in about two years.

That project, called Longspur Wind, is “midway through its permitting process with state and local agencies” and positioned to meet the deadline to qualify for federal clean energy tax incentives, Pierce said. Those incentives could reduce the net cost of its power by 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour, or about 15% of the average retail power price paid by Minnesota customers.

Minnesota Power’s close working relationship with state and local officials in North Dakota should work to its benefit as it seeks approval for Longspur, Kevin Pranis, marketing manager for the Minnesota and North Dakota chapter of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, said in an interview. LIUNA members build and operate power plants for utilities across the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota Power.

“Allete has been doing business in North Dakota for years, so it helps to be a known quantity,” he said. In an ironic twist, Pranis said that good will stems in part from Allete’s ownership of BNI Energy, a North Dakota-based coal miner.

But Longspur could be a rare bright spot in a more challenging environment for renewable energy development toward the end of the decade.

“We think we have a busy two years of projects, but after that it’s less clear,” Pranis said, citing the loss of federal tax incentives and the “weaponization of the permitting process.”

“If your construction start is more than three years out, you’re working through some big questions,” he said. Still, “with our [climate] goals in Minnesota, we’re just going to keep rolling ahead.”",https://d5c1j5k5drfk7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25169563230246-2-2000x1333-1.webp,N,,2025-09-12 11:00:55.216693
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-12 12:06:19+00:00,The New Lede,Rooftop solar is in a slump. Are dark days ahead? - The New Lede,Brian Bienkowski,,,,,https://www.thenewlede.org/2025/09/rooftop-solar-california-utilities-clean-energy/,"In the first quarter of 2025, the trend continued: residential solar installs declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2024.
“California leaders have basically turned their back on rooftop [solar energy],” Dave Rosenfeld, executive director of the Solar Rights Alliance, said.
The messaging has been a key factor in the current slump hitting rooftop solar, according to solar advocates.
Lyser said NEM 3.0’s intent was to prompt more solar storage — not kill rooftop solar — by making midday solar exports less valuable and evening power more lucrative.
“And rooftop solar customers trend much wealthier compared to other customers, and so we do see this as an equity issue,” she added.","A decade ago Greg Sparks and his wife put 20 solar panels on the roof of their home in California’s Sacramento Valley, hoping that using sunlight to power their electrical needs would reduce their utility bills and help the planet.

“My assumption was that (electrical utility) rates will go up,” Sparks said. “And it was just the right thing to do.”

The panels paid off. Sparks estimates his neighbors now pay about $250 a month for electricity, while his monthly bill is zero. Sparks is one of roughly 1.8 million homeowners who have helped make California a national leader in the adoption of residential solar, typically installed on rooftops.

From 2015 to 2023, California’s small-scale solar capacity, generated largely from residential rooftops and shared community panels on rooftops and solar farms — rose roughly six-fold, according to data from California’s three largest electric utilities. Nationally, small-scale solar capacity grew nearly five-fold over that time frame.

But while supporters champion the benefits of residential solar, including a reduction in reliance on polluting fossil fuels and lower bills, critics say the systems that save money for individual homeowners cause costs to rise for those without the systems as increased rooftop solar creates challenges for utilities that must maintain the stability of a power grid infrastructure with fewer paying customers.

Now, the popularity of residential solar is seeing a steep reversal due to shifting state and federal policies driven by powerful utility interests. And while some say the decline is simply a mild adjustment, others fear the market for residential solar may be on the brink of a long-term slide.

Forty-two states saw a decrease in residential solar installs last year, with residential solar capacity down 39%, according to the most recent report from the US Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). In the first quarter of 2025, the trend continued: residential solar installs declined 13% compared to the first quarter of 2024. More than 100 solar companies filed for bankruptcy in 2024.

The decreases in home solar installs started before the Trump administration took office in January, but are expected to accelerate given the administration’s moves to gut key clean energy programs and wipe out tax credits for residents installing solar panels, according to analysts. “It’s not looking good. I don’t know how long I’ll take for it to recover,” Grace Wu, an assistant professor in the environmental studies program at University of California, Santa Barbara, said.

California, the leader in adoption, now is leading the reversal. The state accounted for roughly 48% of last year’s nationwide decrease in residential solar installations.

The backpedaling is angering environmental advocates who say every possible solar panel is needed to reduce harmful greenhouse gases generated by traditional energy sources.

“California leaders have basically turned their back on rooftop [solar energy],” Dave Rosenfeld, executive director of the Solar Rights Alliance, said. “As a result, we’re going backwards.”

A charged debate

Overall, solar energy capacity continues to grow in the US, but most of that growth is generated by utilities installing their own solar panels. In 2024, US utilities increased installed solar capacity 60% compared to 2023. Solar power production increased by 25% in 2024 over the previous year, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

The agency forecasted earlier this year that other energy sources will remain at the same capacity over the next couple years while renewables, specifically solar, will “drive the growth of US power generation.”

Last year, 24 states generated more than 5% of their electricity from solar — California generated the most at 32.4%. These two divergent paths for solar energy generation — increasing at utilities and lagging at homes — is fueling a national debate over the path forward, and nowhere is the debate more charged than in California, the state with the most solar energy, capacity, potential and controversy.

The debate largely boils down to who should pay — and how much. California utilities and regulators argue that incentives for residents with home solar cost residents without solar more than $8.5 billion in electric bills last year. But solar advocates say that number is wrong and there actually is a $1.5 billion net benefit.

Amid the debate, utility rates are rising. The average cost of electricity for US consumers is 5.5% higher today than last year, and an estimated 59 electric and gas utilities raised or are proposing to raise utility bills this year — representing a nearly $38.3 billion increase for consumers.

A July analysis from the non-partisan think tank Energy Innovation predicts new federal policies will increase rates another 9% to 18% by 2035.

In August, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced it was ending a key federal program known as Solar for All, which had earmarked about $7 billion for installation of rooftop solar at an estimated 900,000 lower- and middle-income households.

“California leaders have basically turned their back on rooftop [solar energy].” Dave Rosenfeld, Solar Rights Alliance

Calling the program a “boondoggle,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency no longer has the authority or the funds to administer the program. The move followed the passage of the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which makes significant cuts to solar incentive programs — including ending a tax credit that allowed homeowners who installed solar to deduct 30% of the system’s cost from their taxes.

For Shelly Lyser, the program manager for electricity pricing & customer programs at California’s Public Advocates Office, whose mission is to lower bills for California utility customers, rooftop solar is an important part of the energy mix, but she said rooftop customers need to pay the cost of their service on the grid.

“We believe in having a program where you can have rooftop solar where customers are getting incentives that encourages development … but isn’t six times as expensive as other renewables,” she said.

A long battle

The battle over residential solar began more than a decade ago. In 2012, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association that represents US investor-owned electric companies, had an executive meeting that focused on how to keep making money as more and more residents installed rooftop solar. One bullet point from a presentation made the challenge clear: “How do you grow earnings in this environment?”

That EEI meeting was the unofficial beginning of a campaign: More than a decade ago utilities, often working through EEI, started to change their messaging about rooftop solar. They pushed this message through PR firms, lobbied regulators and lawmakers using model legislation and funded community organizations to amplify talking points about how residential solar shifts costs to those without solar at their home. (EEI did not return requests for a comment.)

The messaging has been a key factor in the current slump hitting rooftop solar, according to solar advocates.

One of the key wins for the utilities came in 2022 in a policy called NEM 3.0 (short for net energy metering). Under NEM 3.0, California regulators slashed rates paid to customers with solar installations for their excess energy by around 75% from previous rates under NEM 2.0, with the idea that it would make bills more affordable for all customers. The change was for anyone who installed solar at their home after April 2023 — while those with it installed before that would get the previous rate for the length of their contracts.

Some major environmental groups — including the Natural Resources Defense Council — agreed with the need for reform, even if they didn’t agree with all of NEM 3.0 changes.

Lyser said NEM 3.0’s intent was to prompt more solar storage — not kill rooftop solar — by making midday solar exports less valuable and evening power more lucrative. “What we most need is to reach those goals as renewables during the peak period of 4 o’clock to 9 o’clock at night, which obviously solar can’t always fill… so you need solar paired with storage,” she said.

“We believe in having a program where you can have rooftop solar where customers are getting incentives that encourages development … but isn’t six times as expensive as other renewables.” -Shelly Lyser, California’s Public Advocates Office

Lyser attributed the downward trend in rooftop solar installation in 2024 to a surge in installations in 2023.

The encouragement for more storage appears to be working.

Terrie Prosper, director of strategic communications for the California Public Utilities Commission, which has authority over the state’s investor-owned utilities, said “the percentage of solar installs that now include battery storage is up to 60% of rooftop solar installations as of 2024 in comparison to 10% under NEM 2.0,” citing a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory May report.

Elaine Kahan, a California Energy Commission spokeswoman, said while rooftop solar is an important part of the state’s resource portfolio, “it comprises a small portion compared to utility scale solar.”

She said early data trends from the commission for the first quarter of 2025 show residential solar rates closer to what they were four years ago before the slump.

But NEM 3.0’s future hangs in the balance: the California Supreme Court in August sided with environmental groups who challenged an earlier ruling on NEM 3.0 and the state’s Court of Appeal will rehear the case. While rooftop solar’s spread in California could hinge on that decision, the arguments that underpin it — how to properly and fairly incentivize and compensate rooftop solar energy — continue.

Cost-shift controversy

Lyser said her office calculates residential solar’s value by crediting avoided costs such as generation, distribution and emissions and then subtracting what solar customers still impose on the grid: fixed costs, backup capacity, maintenance, nighttime use. The gap is what they call the “cost-shift.” The Public Advocates Office estimated an $8.5 billion cost-shift in 2024 to utility customers without rooftop solar.

Prosper said this accounts for approximately 21% to 27% of the average non-solar customer’s bills.

“If your usage goes down to zero, that doesn’t mean the grid isn’t still paying for you to have power at night, when it’s cloudy, or for the basic maintenance of the grid,” Lyser said.” “If you’re avoiding all those costs, then other customers are paying for that.”

But Nathan Phelps, the managing director at Vote Solar’s regulatory advocacy hub, said the cost-shift argument is misleading. “When you just focus on cost, you’re not talking about benefits provided. When we see local solar deployed, not just solar customers benefiting, everyone benefiting … when we suppress (energy) demand, we alleviate the need for expensive new projects.”

A counter analysis in February from the California Solar & Storage Association alleged the $8.5 billion cost-shift estimate is “error-ridden and takes an analytical approach that does not match the technical questions they purportedly seek to address.”

“Correcting their analysis changes the $8.5 billion cost shift to a $1.5 billion net benefit,” the report said, alleging the state analysis assumes customers are obligated to buy all of their electricity from the utilities, ignores that solar installed in low-income homes reduces subsidies needed, “intentionally ignores” that the average customer with home solar still pays $80 to $160 a month, among other alleged errors.

The report found that utilities’ spending — and incentives for spending — are a major driver in the state’s rate spike, citing data that utilities’ spending on grid infrastructure such as poles and transmission lines has increased between 130% to 260% for each of the state’s utilities over the past eight to 12 years.

Over the same time, customer rates have increased at a high rate: At three of the state’s largest utilities PG&E, SDG&E and SCE rates increased 104%, 81% and 74%, respectively.

“It’s really in crisis proportions,” said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar & Storage Association. “About a fifth of all Californians are behind on paying their utility bills.”

Record profits

David Feldman, an energy researcher and analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said “a lot of utilities are trying to make good faith efforts to support rooftop solar” but for investor-owned utilities “it’s not just that they care about the operations of the grid and having reliability and stability … they have to make a profit.” And many utilities are incentivized to spend to make that profit.

In California, for every ratepayer dollar spent on transmission and distribution, utilities earn a guaranteed profit of roughly 10%. PG&E, the state’s largest utility, had record profits in 2024 at roughly $2.47 billion. It was its second straight year of record-breaking profit.

“Electricity prices are so high because of utilities spending increases on poles and wires and other infrastructure,” Rosenfeld said.

The spending trend is national: spending by major US utilities to produce electricity decreased 24% from 2003 to 2023, according to federal data. However, over the same time period, utility spending to transmit electricity nearly tripled over this time and spending to distribute energy increased 160%. “Capital spending on overhead lines, poles and towers increased the most,” according to the report. Just a little over 1% of utilities’ infrastructure costs over this time were on customers’ property, including meters and rooftop solar installations.

“When you just focus on cost, you’re not talking about benefits provided. When we see local solar deployed, not just solar customers benefiting, everyone benefiting.” – Nathan Phelps, the managing director at Vote Solar

In California, utilities point to wildfire risk as causing a spike in spending — with customers paying an estimated $35 billion in wildfire-related utility costs since 2019.

Lyser said reports like the California Solar & Storage Association’s ignore that even customers with net-zero usage still rely on the grid for backup, maintenance and reliability. “And rooftop solar customers trend much wealthier compared to other customers, and so we do see this as an equity issue,” she added.

However, when looking at household income, the largest group in California that has solar energy at their homes is households making between $50,000 and $100,000 a year, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

“Sixty percent of all rooftop solar users in California are middle and working class,” Rosenfeld said, referring to households making less than $150,000 a year.

Households making less than $50,000 a year, however, do have the lowest rates of solar at their home, representing just 12% of the state total, but behind the rate (14%) for the highest earners making more than $250,000 a year.

“The idea that now is the time to eliminate solar when the most vulnerable populations could now most benefit from solar is backwards … we’re seeing more equity in solar happen,” Phelps said.

Rosenfeld said these arguments didn’t happen by accident. California utilities donated roughly $212 million in campaign contributions over the past 25 years — including $2.6 million to Governor Gavin Newsom.

“Newsom has taken more money from the utilities than [former governors] Schwarzenegger and Brown combined,” Rosenfeld said. “And you can see that in the direction that his administration has gone in rooftop solar.”

Governor Newsom’s office directed questions about residential solar to the state’s Energy Commission and Public Utilities Commission.

While the fate of NEM 3.0 rests in the courts, other battles continue: just this summer California Assemblymember Lisa Calderon put forth a bill that would have broken more than two million contracts backed by the state that guaranteed solar systems installed at homes had a 20-year net metering plan with utilities, regardless of whether the home was sold. The bill was defeated.

“The new administration turns right around in less than two years after promising these people that their contract was going to be safe and push a bill to break the contract,” Rosenfeld said. “We defeated that effort, but it took a massive effort.”

“The sun is going to keep shining”

Despite headwinds, many advocates of rooftop solar remain convinced it is the long-term answer to consumer energy demands.

“The sun is going to keep shining and utility bills are incredibly high,” Heavner said. “Solar is still a very good investment for customers.”

Phelps said residential and rooftop solar can be much more nimble with urgent energy needs.

“When it comes to large scale projects, when they come online – it’s a large amount of solar coming online at once but there are also delays in those projects,” he said. “Large projects can take years, local solar can take just months.”

California alone has the potential to produce more than five times more energy from solar on rooftops and in parking lots and commercial buildings, according to estimates.

Phelps said there are a couple states that have found ways for rooftop solar to fit better within the utilities’ best interest. In 2021, Hawaii, for example, adopted “performance-based regulation,” which ties utility revenue to performance on things like reliability, cutting bills and expanding clean energy rather than the previous spend more, earn more model.

Hawaii saw a 7.5% increase in solar systems, most of which are residential. Dozens of other states — including New York, North Carolina and Minnesota — have adopted some performance-based regulations or are considering it.

But performance-based regulation is imperfect. Hawaii still has some of the highest electric bills in the nation, however, the state’s utility commission estimates the performance-based changes will have saved customers more than $70 million over the past four years.

Sparks, the Sacramento Valley resident with rooftop solar, said he hopes that even with reduced incentives his fellow neighbors can find ways to take advantage of rooftop solar’s benefits — for their bills and for the planet.

“We’re just trying to do what we can to reduce our carbon footprint and this is one of the easiest ways that it can happen,” Sparks said.",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/getty-images-2d_ReXUzgoU-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 09:58:30.434514

China continues to be the world’s biggest EV market, but sales growth cooled to 6% in August compared to a year earlier, when the Chinese sales surged with the introduction of the trade-in scheme.

Total global EV sales in August reached 1.7 million units, including 1.16 million Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 570,000 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), according to Rho Motion’s data.

Sales in the United States accelerated to reach a monthly record in August, due to the upcoming expiry of the tax credits in September, Rho Motion Data Manager, Charles Lester, said.

Emissions legislation continues to underpin sales in the top European markets Germany and the UK, while China’s growth slowed compared to high sales numbers a year ago at the start of the Chinese trade-in scheme.

“Y-o-y growth in the Chinese market slowed in July-August 2025, however, this is compared to a period where subsidies for the auto trade-in scheme increased last year, which spurred on EV demand in the country,” Lester said.

Year to date, global EV sales rose by 25%, with Chinese growth also at 25% and Europe’s sales increase at 31%.

North American EV sales rose by 6% between January and August, but there is high uncertainty from the fourth quarter onwards, in view of the end of the tax credits.

The rush to take advantage of the tax credits pushed the U.S. electric vehicle market to its highest-ever monthly sales in August, with over 175,000 units sold, Rho Motion’s EV & Battery Database showed earlier this week.

Under the OBBBA, the 30D purchase credit and the 45W leasing credit – both worth up to $7,500 on eligible EVs – will end.

“There’s high uncertainty of how big the EV sales drop off will be in Q4,” said Will Roberts, Automotive Research Lead at Rho Motion.

Automakers are already adjusting to this expected dip. VW has announced plans to scale back ID.4 production in the U.S. from October, while GM will cut output at several EV facilities, Rho Motion noted.

Speaking at the State Review Meeting on Renewable Energy organised by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), the Minister said the country is expanding its efforts beyond modules to include wafers and ingots, paving the way for a comprehensive solar manufacturing ecosystem within India.

Shri Joshi emphasised that this move will reduce import dependence, generate employment, attract investment, and strengthen India’s position as a global leader in clean energy manufacturing. He appreciated the efforts of various states in advancing renewable energy initiatives, noting that these contributions are helping India move towards its 2030 vision of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil capacity. With 251.5 GW already installed, the Minister described this milestone as evidence of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visionary leadership, which is driving clean energy growth and manufacturing in the renewable sector.

Progress Under PM Surya Ghar and PM-KUSUM

The Minister highlighted that nearly 20 lakh households have benefitted from the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, urging states and distribution companies to ensure quality compliance and offer optimal tariff credits. On the PM-KUSUM scheme, he noted its growing popularity across states and announced that the second phase will be launched after March 2026.

Addressing concerns regarding free electricity, Shri Joshi stated that benefits must be delivered in a financially sustainable way. He pointed out that about half of the beneficiaries under PM Surya Ghar currently enjoy zero electricity bills, demonstrating a sustainable model that balances relief with long-term viability.

Renewable Capacity and Ease of Doing Business

India has achieved the milestone of 50% of installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of schedule. However, the Minister cautioned that capacity additions must be matched with effective utilisation. He urged states to expedite Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs), power purchase agreements (PPAs), and land allotments, warning that delays in procurement could undermine broader goals.

Calling for strengthened Ease of Doing Business, Shri Joshi encouraged states to adopt single-window clearance systems, reduce compliance burdens, and address right of way and law-and-order challenges. He further urged wind-rich states to develop time-bound roadmaps for site allocation and transmission readiness.

The Minister welcomed the recent GST reduction from 12% to 5% on renewable energy devices, making technologies such as solar, wind, biogas, and waste-to-energy systems more affordable.

Domestic Manufacturing Achievements

Highlighting successes in domestic manufacturing, Shri Joshi pointed to the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, with an outlay of ₹24,000 crore. Under this scheme, India has established 100 GW of module manufacturing capacity, attracted ₹50,000 crore in investments, and created over 12,600 direct jobs.

The Minister reaffirmed that India’s energy transition would require collaborative action from the Centre, states, industry, and citizens, and assured full support from MNRE while inviting stakeholders to share ideas for accelerating renewable energy deployment.

Supporting Remarks from Other Leaders

Union Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy, Shri Shripad Naik, praised the PM-KUSUM and PM Surya Ghar schemes as central to India’s mission for energy security and sustainability. He noted that over 16 lakh solar pumps have been installed or solarised, reducing diesel consumption by 1.3 billion litres annually, cutting 40 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions, and saving foreign exchange. The PM Surya Ghar scheme is installing 4,500 systems daily, supported by 18,000 vendors nationwide, empowering farmers and households while reducing emissions and creating jobs.

MNRE Secretary Shri Santosh Kumar Sarangi underscored that India’s green energy transition is vital to meeting its net zero target by 2070, with ambitions of 1,800 GW renewable capacity by 2047 and 5,000 GW by 2070. He highlighted successful state initiatives, including Maharashtra’s PM-KUSUM implementation, Gujarat’s renewable clusters, and Karnataka’s land facilitation efforts.

State-Wise Assessment and Future Roadmap

The review meeting featured a state-wise assessment of the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana and PM-KUSUM, with presentations from states detailing progress and challenges. Industry associations shared insights on sectoral issues, and stakeholder consultations were held to align policy reforms with the design of PM-KUSUM 2.0.

With stop-work orders, red tape, and wild claims about whale-killing electromagnetic fields, the White House has stepped up its war on wind.

The flashpoint is Ørsted’s $5 billion Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island, which was weeks from delivering 700 megawatts of clean power to New England, and now frozen by federal order. The threat against the project is more than a local fight: It signals that even fully permitted, nearly finished clean energy assets can be derailed for political leverage.

Analysts warn that this is sending shock waves through the entire energy sector, raising the cost of capital for everything from solar farms to advanced nuclear.

Katherine Hamilton: Plus, what you do there has to stay there, so that’s inefficient.

Jigar Shah: Well, not if you’re podcasting. We are like, “We are going to change that today.”

Stephen Lacey: Okay. You’ve been going to RE+ formerly known as SPI for a lot of years. Pop quiz for you. Do you remember who the keynote speaker was in 2008?

Jigar Shah: No. Was it Obama?

Stephen Lacey: No. It was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean we definitely have our share of duds.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. On his first day in office, Trump laid out his wind policy in one simple sentence, “We are not going to do the wind thing,” he said, before halting approvals for wind projects. And that was certainly true and was just a preview. With stop work orders, red tape and wild claims about whale killing, electromagnetic fields and underwater drone threats, America is indeed not doing the wind thing anymore.

We’ll look at the carnage in the wind industry and more importantly why it matters for all clean energy. Plus layoffs are sweeping around clean energy. What does it mean for the broader economy when the jobs’ engine sputters. And finally, Amory Lovins is arguing the AI boom won’t save nuclear, but Silicon Valley and the Trump administration are betting it will, who is right?

Welcome to the show, I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m joined by Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah are my co-host. Katherine is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions and the executive director of Common Charge. Hi, Katherine.

Katherine Hamilton: Hello. Instead of heading out to Vegas tomorrow, I’m heading up to my alma mater Cornell to give some talks to the engineering school and the business school. So I’m super excited about heading back to Ithaca.

Stephen Lacey: What’s the thesis of the conversation?

Katherine Hamilton: Kind of transition in a time of chaos, like what’s happening? How is the transition going? And I’m there to buck them up, I think.

Stephen Lacey: Jigar is a clean energy investor. He’s the former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. Jigar, what is on the docket for RE+? What’s the vibe check right now?

Jigar Shah: It’s a fascinating thing, right? I have been traveling a lot this year because there’s a lot of people who want to understand how to process this moment. I think they feel the aggression that has come for our industry and they did not expect it because many folks here frankly are conservative.

And I think that they are now recognizing that they have a lot of opportunity in front of them, particularly on the distributed generation side. And that they need to actually look inward and figure out how we cut costs by 40% and figure out how to meet this moment. In the same way that the fracking industry frankly did when the Saudis came after them in 2014, 2015 and they rationalized their supply chain, they figured out where all the bloat is.

I have been very impressed by how many residential solar installers in particular have dramatically changed the way that they’re doing customer acquisition. They’re moving away from door-to-door sales, they’re moving to AI enabled tools to dramatically reduce the cost of bringing a contract to installation. And so I think a lot of people believe in the Tesla white paper that they can cut 40% of the cost of their installation over the next 18 months.

Offshore wind under siege

Stephen Lacey: Okay, let’s roll into the show. So let’s tackle offshore wind, the problems in that industry and what it means for everything else that needs to get deployed quickly. So 20 years ago, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cut the head off a dead whale with a chainsaw and strapped it to the roof of his car. That is a real story recounted by his daughter, and I can think of no better metaphor for what the Trump administration is doing to offshore wind.

The past eight months have brought frozen permits, yanked funding and flimsy investigations into electromagnetic fields and drone attacks under offshore wind farms. A few weeks ago, his administration ordered work to stop at Orsted’s $4 billion Revolution Wind Project off Rhode Island. A project that was 80% complete and weeks from delivering 700 megawatts of clean power to Connecticut and Rhode Island. And now the administration is pulling back hundreds of millions of dollars in port funding that was approved under Biden. So I could go on and on and on here. Katherine, give us the lay of the land. Have you ever seen anything like this in your career?

Katherine Hamilton: No, although there are a lot of different angles to this. So there are five offshore wind projects actually under construction, two of which have been issued stop work orders. So that still leaves three under construction. And I’ll just say first there’s a really big pushback. So as you noted, Orsted, the Revolution Wind Project, challenged the DC, District Court, they filed for preliminary injunction this last Friday night on that stop work order.

They have people stranded on a ship in the water until they know what they’re supposed to be doing. All their labor forces out there, Connecticut and Rhode Island have filed in the Rhode Island district also about Revolution, US Wind in Maryland and then 17 states in the district are suing the government and challenging the presidential authority from the day one executive order. And they’ve done an oral argument but no ruling yet.

And what that shows is that this is a big industry and a lot of these projects are mostly done. Some of them like Vineyard’s already generating electricity, even though their project is not completely done, they’re already starting to generate electricity. And these are projects that are ready to go. Those that have already been under construction are ready to put electrons on the grid and this administration is with a lot of misinformation, and we can dive into what that is, has just decided that it doesn’t like it.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I think a big part of this is that Trump personally hates wind, but another question is whether this is a tactic to extract concessions from governors. So you mentioned the offshore wind project in New York and that was allowed to move forward after supposedly Kathy Hochul made concessions on approving gas pipeline infrastructure. I think her office denies that exactly. But many are speculating whether this is just going to be another way that Trump can extract concessions from people and exercise raw power. What do you guys make of that element of this stop work order?

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean it’s clear that the reporting at least is that he did successfully do that in New York. So if a playbook works, you sort of continue to do it again. But I want to make sure that we hearken back to episodes that we did back in 2017, 2018, 2019 to talk about the fact that we predicted that this would happen.

Stephen Lacey: What did we predict?

Jigar Shah: Well, when projects are fully approved for construction, like XL Pipeline was fully approved, like Mountain Valley Pipeline was fully approved, and then later an administration cancels the permit after it was fully approved. Then the challenge with that is that, and I’m not suggesting this equivalency, what we’re talking about here is completely and utterly beyond any sort of logic that I could possibly think of, but I think that we have so politicized energy in this country now that we are now in a place where everything is on the table.

And I think that that is a really bad thing. I think that we should understand that having an abundant energy supply in our country is what allows us to be innovative. It’s what allows us to be artistic, it’s what allows us to do all the things that we do and we sort of politicize all these things to our peril.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, that’s an interesting point. I think there’s a long history of energy infrastructure being politicized. When you look at a lot of the fracking bans, many of the pipeline bans, a lot of cities creating regulations to push gas connections out of buildings. I think people inside the Trump administration and a lot of people on the right generally would say the left has been doing this for a long time. To your point, I think it’s important to separate just how different the Trump administration’s tactics are, but I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there who see them as part of the same story.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah. So that may be true, but I also feel like this is different and very specific and maybe you can find linkages. I just hadn’t quite thought of those linkages, but in the case of the wind projects, it feels like a very emotional rationale for stopping something that is just electrons that are ready or already being fed to the grid. That New England ISO, which is not exactly right, left leaning group, they’re just like, “Hey, we’re just the ISO New England. We’re just the guys that control the grid.” They’ve basically said that stopping Revolution Wind would undermine system reliability. That is a big deal.

But if you look at what the rationale is from the government, they’re just making things up. So they said that there’s something about national security because of underwater drones being able to attack when why would that not also affect sub-sea oil and gas lines or sub-sea internet service? They’re just things that they’re making up and they’re all kind of in it together. And I would say RFK Jr., the whale head dude, he’s been saying a couple of things. One is that it’s super expensive, that it’s 34 cents a kilowatt-hour.

It’s not. The fixed price contracts are between seven and 15 cents a kilowatt-hour. Revolution Wind is 9.80 cents a kilowatt-hour. That is not 34 cents a kilowatt-hour. And then RFK Jr.’s also saying that this is very harmful, that there are 109 whale groundings in 22 months. Zero whale groundings have been linked to wind at all. None. Whale groundings are linked to vessels and fisherman’s nets and climate change migration and all kinds of other things but not wind. And so it just feels like they’re coming up with things pre-textual, like, “We’re going to find things that are wrong to make up for the fact that this is a very emotional decision on the part of the president.”

Stephen Lacey: Mm-hmm, and it’s been just such an extraordinarily hard time for the offshore wind industry. They got hit particularly hard by inflationary pressures and this Revolution Wind project was so close to being done, it is so close to being done. But, Jigar, Orsted now says it needs like nine and a half billion dollars to keep this project afloat. Is this project financeable? Is offshore wind generally financeable still in the US?

Jigar Shah: You’d have to think twice. And remember, it’s not just this project. I think that part of this is recognizing that the work that we’re doing here is impacting our relationships with Denmark broadly in the same way that the raid in Georgia affects our relationship with South Korea broadly, these are countries who have decided to invest billions of dollars into our country and bring their expertise, which is considerable.

And I would think twice, but more than that, remember they also have invested in supply chain jobs. So when you think about the towers and you think about all the ships that are being produced, part of this is the ship that was used here was produced in Steve Scalise’s district down in Louisiana. I just think that the shock waves of this project being paused, but also the jobs that are being impacted across the entire country is profound.

And it’s something that I have a really hard time wrapping my brain around. Because if you’re the Danish government and you get wronged on this front, would you invest in circular economy projects? Would you invest in other areas where you have expertise that you want to bring in to the United States? I think that they would’ve to think twice.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I just spoke with a wind executive who said that a huge amount of the investment is from upfront lease acquisition, hundreds of millions of dollars, even a billion dollars to acquire a lease. And the good news on that front is that these are long-dated, so 35 years, these are long-term lease arrangements. So that as long as you have that under your belt, if you can bide your time, we might find a way out because a lot of that upfront investment has been made.

Stephen Lacey: To your bigger point, Jigar, what other technologies could this impact? So a lot of analysts are worried about this sending shock waves through clean energy writ large, forcing financiers to reassess risk for everything from gas plants to advanced nuclear potentially. So if government approvals can be undone at will, what is actually safe? How big are the potential casualties across the energy system or the grid system?

Jigar Shah: Well, and remember we also got a cancellation which was illegal of the loan for a Grain Belt Express. And so this is a transmission line that is so desperately needed to bring power from SPP to MISO. And so you’re in this world where there’s a lot of people who provide capital along the way. So I think we think sometimes about capital around at the end of the project so that at the completion of the project you have debt, you have equity, et cetera.

But along the way you have development capital, you have other types of capital, and if routine things, like for instance permits at the Department of Interior might have to provide for solar projects that are on private land but have some sort of routine checkoff from some local office. I’m now hearing that some local offices are working fine as if they got no new instructions from the Trump administration. Other local offices are paralyzed, because they’re not sure what the Trump administration wants them to do in terms of these routine approvals.

And so, if you’re providing development capital to a project, and you’re like, “I don’t know whether that routine approval is going to come through,” do you fund that project? I think that there’s just all this uncertainty and even if things move forward, the cost of capital goes up. And so then now the PPA price that someone needs to sign at the very end goes up. And so I don’t understand on the macro world here, which I think the Trump administration is operating under, is that they believe that there is so much natural gas in this country that if they just built unlimited amounts of natural gas that we could just solve all of our electricity problems with AI, et cetera. And the math is just not on their side.

Just to give you one example, if you take the Permian Basin because you can’t get gas from the Marcellus down to the LNG export terminals, there’s not enough pipeline capacity. So if you take the Permian Basin and you power the entire 500 gigawatts of Stargate data centers with natural gas that would use up a third of all of the natural gas in the Permian Basin through the next 32 years. You’re saying that that would have no impact whatsoever on the cost of natural gas in that region? That that would have no impact on our ability to export LNG gas with the natural gas terminals that have already installed? It’s maddening.

Nobody in their right mind would ever go all in on natural gas when we’re already at 40% natural gas. We need diversification. You need offshore wind, you need solar, we need geothermal, we need to keep our nuclear plants running. All of that stuff needs to happen in this moment if we’re going to meet the load growth. And I just think that all of these data points are confusing to normal voters. They are not looking to become PhDs in electricity design and technologies and development. But I think that for many people, like Trump’s Truth social account is supposed to be telling them that, “We could just do this all with natural gas, but for all these woke leftists.”

Katherine Hamilton: We’re also going to see knock on effects of all these other industries that the administration purports to care about. For example, shipping. Well, the offshore industry has improved ports, Empire Wind improved South Brooklyn. Revolution, New London. Vineyard, New Bedford. These are all improved marine terminals and those are also getting funding reduced when we need more of those.

And those would also help boost those priorities that the president claims to have for building more ships, for doing other kinds of trade. And so there’s always a knock on effect if you curb one industry and offshore wind has created so much additional both supply chain and other types of industries that are surrounding it, that you’re going to have an adverse impact on a bunch of other things too.

Jigar Shah: I think that actually, yes, they’re winning some sort of meme war on Twitter, but they’re not winning the main street argument. And I think the ones who are the most nervous about this that I’m talking to are the electric utilities. They really believe that they are going to be blamed fully for these rate increases and that they believe that Trump is going to aim the Eye of Sauron on them.

Stephen Lacey: Yes, he will.

Jigar Shah: And when that happens, then they are going to have to respond in kind around why they’re doing battery storage and why they’re doing solar and why they’re doing all this other stuff because there’s no other choice. Even if they wanted to do whatever Trump wanted to do, it’s not possible. They can’t build natural gas power plants in time to bring all these loads on board. They can’t build nuclear plants in time to bring all these loads on board. And so they are caught in the middle and right now they’re keeping their mouth shut because they frankly have no political power given the changes at EEI and all the other things.

But what I’m worried about is that this offshore wind piece is giving all of this confidence to people in the administration. And what’s in fact going to happen is that you’re going to see a rallying of all of these different people including oil and gas. Remember the oil and gas industry is not happy with this administration. The steel and aluminum tariffs, all this stuff, has made their profitability go way down, right? Chevron just announced that they’re cutting 20% of their entire global workforce.

And so you’re seeing all of these negative ripple effects and no one is willing to stand up to the president this week. But I think collectively you will see that people will have to stand up to the president at some point because we’re just not going to be able to meet our energy goals.

Katherine Hamilton: But all of those utilities, all of these companies, offshore wind included, they all have employees and people, many of whom voted for this president for very different reasons. Those folks that are stuck on that boat in the middle off the coast because of the revolution stop order, a lot of those I’m sure voted for this president because they didn’t think that their job was a woke job. They just thought it was a really good construction job.

And so I think you’re going to start seeing, if he goes too hard, an erosion of support from people who just want work and they want really good work and they found a good job in an industry that was growing. And I think that’s going to come back to bite all of those folks who are not standing up for the industries that are being kneecapped.

Stephen Lacey: All right. So do you think this is the end of the US offshore wind industry?

Katherine Hamilton: I do not. I actually think they’re going to keep going. I think some of them may kind of wait it out a bit. I think the ones that are about to go online are going to get online. They’re going to find a way through the courts. They’re going to get online. I think some of those who already have leases and have spent gobs of money trying to make sure that they’ve got those in place and that have the long-term contracts and OffTEC agreements, I think they might wait it out because they will see that it will turn around. This is a long-term big infrastructure industry. I don’t think it’s dead.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I would say it a little bit differently, which is that I agree with Katherine, but I think that the president is putting us into a massive recession. Through that massive recession, you’re going to start to see some harmonization of some of the inflation stuff and some of the other sort of cost drivers that were hurting offshore wind. And I think offshore wind will come roaring back strong sort of in that 2030, 2031 timeframe. But it’s just the most maddening thing to see the politicization of energy.

Because what I worry about is that if a Democrat comes back in the White House, they’re going to be pressured to politicize all sorts of other energy sources that we also need to keep the lights on. So I just think that we need to be very careful about politicizing energy sources.

Is the clean energy jobs engine sputtering?

Stephen Lacey: So I just had a news alert pop up on my computer from the Wall Street Journal, “Revised BLS data show the US likely added 900,000 fewer jobs than initially reported over the last 12 months that ended in March.” So that brings us into our jobs’ conversation. We got a weak August Jobs report, job creation was down 75% from last year. The overall clean energy jobs story is a schizophrenic right? On one hand, many of the headlines are pretty brutal. PosiGen shutting down power and in bankruptcy, AES cutting thousands of people. Of course we talked about this E2 study of dozens of projects that have been canceled or downsized, erasing over 15,000 jobs and tens of billions of dollars in investment.

But on the other hand, I have not looked at the latest data that just popped up on my screen here, but the last data that I saw from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that clean energy is still a pretty fast-growing part of the US workforce. They’re expected to add over 40,000 jobs by 2030. And so I want to kind of understand where we are on the macro level where clean energy is a bright spot, but on the micro level, how individual companies are suffering or recalibrating. So Katherine, how do you reconcile those two realities?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, so I think there are a few things at play. There are very specific business models that right now are in real jeopardy and I would say PosiGen falls into that. They’re very much pegged to LMI communities that are reliant on government funding, the Solar for All program, all of those things that the Inflation Reduction Act put into place with a lot of investment. When that was pulled back, some of those entities that had really relied on that to beef up their workforce are now finding themselves without the funding to do so. So those are very specific examples of types of business models.

Now that’s terrible because it negatively affects communities that most need access to solar. And then there’s another piece, and I would say vote solar probably falls into this and a few other entities that rely on philanthropic funding. And a lot of the philanthropies are being pulled in a bunch of different directions including internationally because everything that’s happening with the US government pulling out, so you’re just finding more strain on philanthropic organizations.

So if you don’t have government support and your philanthropies are strained, you have to have something else. You have to have a really strong business model. You have to be able to pivot quickly. You have to be able to rely not just on public policy, but actually on market signals and on cost-effectiveness. And so I think that’s part of what you’re seeing and that the folks that have had strong business models that have been able to pivot or be able to double down on what they do best are going to be okay.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I think that’s a pretty good read of the landscape. Jigar, are there any commonalities among the companies where we’ve seen widespread layoffs?

Jigar Shah: Well, I think when you say layoffs in the clean energy sector, I think we’re talking mostly about bankruptcies. I don’t know that there’s a lot of people that are cutting 10% of their workforce. It’s more people who are like, “We ran out of cash and we have to shut down.” I think that what’s interesting in the broader clean energy marketplace is that we have a lot of weak companies, and those weak companies were, I think buoyed really by low interest rates out of COVID. I think as the interest rates went way up over the last two years, a lot of them faced a lot of strain in their business model and figuring out how they navigated that I think was already quite challenging.

And I think that as Katherine’s suggesting, I think with all the headwinds from the political rhetoric, there’s a lot of investors going, “Do I really want to put more money into some of these companies right now?” The good thing is that there’s a tremendous number of clean tech companies who actually have been quite disciplined over the last two years and they grew a lot less quickly because they’ve been more disciplined, and so they decided to grow more slowly and they are doing fine. And so they are hiring like crazy right now and they are actually taking over the market share from the companies who are going bankrupt.

And so, the overall deployment of clean energy has never been stronger, and I’m more bullish today at RE+ than I was coming in on my airplane flight into Vegas. And so I do think there’s a lot of people with a good head on their shoulders. I don’t think that that means that everyone is going to make this pivot well. I think that there’s going to be some percentage, a healthy percentage of companies that go bankrupt here over the next six months, but I think all of that market share will be taken up by the companies that are healthy. And so, as a result, we will have net job creation through 2030.

I think that people will continue to get jobs in this sector. I think this is the place where young people want to work. As I talked to young people this year, they still want to work in this sector. And so I think the future is very bright and I do think that clean energy also is broad. It’s not just solar. It’s going to be a lot of battery storage over the next five to eight years, which I think is super exciting.

Katherine Hamilton: I would pick up on that and say exactly, I’m seeing a lot of companies that are now scooping up the assets of those that are going under and finding that is tremendous opportunity for growth. As you say, they’ve been kind of lying in wait to see where the detritus landed. And then the other piece is on the job side, Jigar, jobs are changing a little bit because of the way our AI and all these other industries are moving. New manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, some of the jobs are changing, some of the skill needs are different, but that just creates more opportunity I think for people coming out of school.

Stephen Lacey: So the BLS data shows that on the generation side, solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, we could see 41,000 jobs by 2030. While battery and electrical component manufacturing could add almost 50,000 positions. Jigar, do you think there are any particular areas that are poised to grow the workforce faster?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, to Katherine’s point, I think that the jobs are changing radically. So when you look at some of the new companies that I met here at RE+, we have reduced the cost of developing a project by 80%. So it used to cost X dollars to build or to find the right spot for a battery or the right spot for solar. It now costs 80% less than that money.

And why? Because a lot of those standardized reports, a lot of the work around which substations are the best, a lot of that stuff can be done with AI models and with outsourced models and that kind of stuff. And so reports that used to cost $30,000 are now costing $6,000. And so that to me means a lot of jobs are moving out of those places, reports and just reading unstructured data, and AI is doing a lot more of that. And you’re seeing a lot more jobs in revenue maximization.

So the value of some of the revenue streams in battery storage, for instance in Texas, has gone down 82% the last two years because batteries have taken the volatility from the ERCOT market. But you find that there’s actually five additional revenue streams that they’re getting access to now, and they’re stacking a lot of those value streams. And so there’s a lot of new jobs in people who are experts at unlocking those new value streams. So those are jobs that are being created.

But the tried and true jobs that continue to be there are the trades. We still have a shortage of electricians and we still have a shortage of LIUNA workers and the laborers and operating engineers and all of those people. And so every single EPC contractor I’ve talked to in the last 24 hours has said that they are fully booked out through ’26, just no space whatsoever in their dance card and that they are short workers. And so if you know somebody who just graduated from college but doesn’t have a job, they would be happy to take them on as apprentices and figure out a way to get them a meaningful career in the trades.

Stephen Lacey: What do you make of the way the green jobs’ policy political conversation has shifted? We’re like two decades into the mainstreaming of the term green jobs. No one really uses the term green jobs anymore, at least in mainstream political discourse. Katherine, how has it changed?

Katherine Hamilton: Well, I think you were getting people who had environmental leanings to get into industries that are hard tech industries. These are real jobs with real people. As Jigar says, a lot of them are trade jobs, and so you have a confluence of people who are interested in doing things that are mitigating or adapting for climate change.

At the same time, you get people who just want jobs and these are good jobs. And so, I think what that means is that when you bring all that together, it ends up just being economic driver. It doesn’t matter if you want to call it green or not. And right now in some places green, the term, seems to be out of favor, but the result is the same. And I think it’s a good thing that these are just considered good jobs.

Jigar Shah: Well, we also don’t need to classify stuff anymore. I don’t call us alternative energy, I just call us dominant.

Katherine Hamilton: No, right.

Jigar Shah: That’s what happens these days, right? You’re in this place where when you’re 85% of everything that gets added to the grid, I mean so much winning.

Is the AI bubble inflating nuclear?

Stephen Lacey: Speaking of winning, the question we want to ask now is nuclear winning. And Amory Lovins, the longtime nuclear skeptic, the founder of the Rocky Mountain Institute, now RMI, just penned a piece in Utility Dive on why he thinks the AI boom will not rescue nuclear power. He called it a bubble within a bubble, and he writes that, “Nuclear lost the race to power the grid. So new reactors have no business case or operational need at this moment.”

So Lovins main point is that, he’s been arguing this for a long time, but he applies this to the AI era, “While AI-driven data center demand is real, it’s being exaggerated potentially.” And we’ve talked a little bit about whether that load growth number is being exaggerated on the data center side. And he says that, “Renewables can mostly meet that growth at lower costs,” and he argues that, “Nuclear keeps missing the same targets, big reactors that arrive years late and billions over budget. The smaller designs cost more per kilowatt-hour and create more waste per unit of energy.”

And so, I don’t think it’s any surprise that Lovins is writing a piece like this, but it does bring up an important question that I want to tackle with and I think that we will continue to wrestle with, which is that is the current demand picture enough to drive this renaissance in the nuclear industry? So, Jigar, you were in this at DOE, you did a lot within DOE to try to get nuclear back on track, what do you make of Amory’s arguments? I know that you’re probably not going to agree with them, but maybe we start with what do you think he gets right and what is off the mark?

Jigar Shah: Well, it’s very clear that the Western governments have had persistent cost overruns on all the nuclear plants that they built, whether it’s Finland or the UK or Vogtle down in Georgia. And he might actually even be right throughout his piece, but I think that the part that bothers me about this way of thinking, and it’s the same way that Jane Fonda thinks about things or Jerry Brown thought about things, is that they just believe that America can never do big things.

Their point of view is basically all of these projects that don’t benefit from manufacturing excellence, the learning curve that we’ve talked about for so many years, cannot be done by the United States. Whether it’s the Big Dig in Boston or whether it’s large port projects, we just can’t do big things and we’re never going to be better. And I just feel like that point of view is stupid.

Why in the world would you believe that America can never do big things? It’s one thing to say that we do not implement the best practices from Brent Flyvbjerg’s book and some of the other books that have come out recently around how to do big things. You have to spend 10% of the entire budget up front, have to measure 34 times and cut once. You can’t rush into projects. There’s lots of things that we can say that are productive in this time. But saying that, “Nuclear power, which I’ve hated since I protested with Jane Fonda at Diablo Canyon is not going to work and here are the random arguments I’m going to use to actually hurt nuclear power,” why?

Just say that we have a hard time doing big things, whether it’s sustainable aviation fuels, whether it’s clean hydrogen, whether it’s decarbonizing, cement and steel. We have a hard time with all of these big things. Why single out nuclear power?

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, what do you think he gets wrong and what do you think he gets right?

Katherine Hamilton: This is so funny when I hear Jigar saying this, I feel like that’s the argument that the Trump administration is making against offshore wind, “Those are big projects. Can we build big projects?” And given that demand is rising and price of electricity is rising, it seems like we have to use whatever we can get our hands on and if there are nuclear plants that are available and able to be brought online cost effectively and in a way that handles demand.

And the trick about demand that Amory Lovins is completely correct about is that it’s uncertain. We don’t really know what’s going to happen. We know for some places what’s going to happen, but it’s also very localized. So making sure that we match whatever we’re building, whether it’s large or small, with where we think demand is going and with affordability, I think that’s going to be the secret sauce. And whatever is going to be the cheapest quickest to get online I think is what we’re going to need to get in the short term. And then we need to think about what do we want to invest in over the long term?

Because yeah, we may need to invest in big projects. I would argue that we need to invest more in transmission projects. Those are big hard projects to do, but those are going to be able to get us what we need in a lot of ways, whether it’s nuclear or any other kind of large generation source.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. This was not a surprise, as I said, that Amory penned this piece. I think what was interesting to me is thinking about the demand picture for data centers, and I think that a lot of the load growth projections are inflated and that has consequences for what you invest in in the long-term to serve the boom in AI and in computing.

And so I think what he gets right in this piece is that we should be sort of skeptical about some of these long-term demand projections, and we should ask whether that is enough to really drive the nuclear industry in particular forward. So, Jigar, what do you think about the demand signal we’re seeing? A lot of this new demand is coming from the tech industry through partnerships and order books and a verbal commitment to the industry. Do you think it is enough to move the industry forward and get projects in the ground?

Jigar Shah: Well, I think the proof is in the pudding. It’s very obvious that the restart of the TMI plant is because of a contract with Microsoft. So that’s pretty clear, right? It’s very clear that when you look at the announcements that Google has made with Kairos, that Google is quite serious about Kairos. And they believe that that 50 megawatt size range is something that is more manufacturable than the 300 megawatt small modular reactors or the AP1000.

And so Google has gone all in on Kairos, and that is interesting. I think when you look at what OPG in Ontario is doing with GE Hitachi’s 300 megawatt reactor at Darlington, they’ve decided that it’s smarter to build four 300 megawatt reactors and learn from each reactor than it is to build one 1,200 megawatt reactor. And so we’re going to know exactly. Those are projects that are absolutely moving forward. They’ve already gotten financing, they’ve already gotten offtake agreements, they’ve already got these things.

Now VC Summer is supposed to announce very soon, and Lindsey Graham has said that they’re definitely restarting the process there. So we’ll see who they pick. And then I can tell you whether I believe that they’re capable of actually restarting the process of finishing VC Summer or not. Holtec has decided to go public as a publicly traded company, and they’re going to use that balance sheet to build to Holtec 300s at Palisades in Michigan, and they also have a deal that they’ve announced in India. So these are real data points with real commercial contracts, with real things.

Now, there’s lots of stuff that I don’t believe. So there’s like a hundred other companies that have announced that they’re doing stuff, and I have looked into whatever I can there and have found nothing underneath there. So nothing that gives me comfort that they’re going to be real. So of the 150 names that have been floated, I think I named six or five. So those are the ones that I think are real.

Now, separately, I think the question becomes how much wealth creation has our country experienced out of owning the internet? I think a lot, right? Then social media companies, then all these cloud computing companies. And so I think it is very clear that if you believe that the US is unlikely to challenge China to be the manufacturing hub of the world that we were in the 1940s, then we need to continue to have these new acts.

And one of the new acts that we think we want to win on is AI. Do I think that AI is going to be fully powered with nuclear? Unlikely, but there are a lot of really commercial contracts being signed right now by companies. Even in Maryland, there’s a very serious conversation happening with the hyperscalers and building another reactor at Calvert Cliffs. And so that’s real. And so it’s an interesting conversation.

Do I think it’s going to get to a final investment decision? I don’t know. I feel like the Loan Programs Office right now is not a place that I would like to hang my hat around efficiently giving me a loan for any new projects. And I don’t see how a lot of these projects move forward without that loan. So we’re going to have to see where that goes. But I just think that like the enthusiasm that I feel for Fervo and all the geothermal names, I also feel enthusiasm for the three, four, five names in the nuclear space that I think are sober who are reading Brent Flyvbjerg’s book and actually really learning from what it takes to do things slowly, methodically, and better this time around.

Are they going to succeed? Hell if I know, but I believe in the commercialization of technologies that have a much lower carbon footprint. I just do. And I don’t think that we’re going to become bankrupt as a country because we try to build $40 billion worth of next generation nuclear plants when at the same time we’re building $550 billion of clean energy from electric vehicles to solar, plus battery storage, to wind to other things on the other side. I feel like there’s a way to be balanced about this conversation without being hyperbolic.

Stephen Lacey: Very well said. I agree with most of that. I think the biggest bottleneck for me right now, sort of taking the handful of examples of things that could move forward is the disorganization within government and what it could do to the public-private partnerships to eventually finance these plants. And it feels to me like that is the big wild card that could prevent some of these plants from going forward.

Katherine, what’s your read on the way the Trump administration is emphasizing nuclear right now? What’s working and not working and how’s the industry reacting?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, there’s this whole storyline about nuclear being more American as a technology. And I checked to see how about the supply chain for all these different technologies, which is more American? The most American is hydropower, 75% of the equipment in the hydropower industry in supply chain. And second is geothermal. It’s basically oil and gas industry, 65%, geothermal. Wind, 55%. We have a lot of wind manufacturing in this country, so a lot of it is American. Nuclear comes down to at 45% and solar is 30%, so solar is the lowest.

But nuclear mining and conversion happen in Canada, enrichment in the EU, especially France, and then reactors and forging are in Japan, South Korea and Europe. It’s a global industry. So anything that the administration does on international relations is going to impact the nuclear power industry as much as if not more than it impacts others. So it’s just something that if the administration believes it’s more American, that’s a great narrative, but it may not be true, especially when you have to rely other countries and rely on trade from other countries to make it happen.

So that’s just something to keep in mind because this is a global marketplace and in order to build big things, you got to work with other countries to do it. And that’s where I think some of the gaps are and what the administration would like to do, what their narrative is and what may happen on the ground.

Stephen Lacey: I guess the last question that I have is about cost. Are we seeing learning curves in nuclear, Jigar? Are you bullish about cost reductions?

Jigar Shah: So we certainly are seeing learning curves out of China, but I think there’s a lot of people who are worried that we can’t match that here in the United States. I think when you read the Liftoff Report that we published in January of 2025, as we were leaving office, we were very sober, so we said it was going to cost $20 a watt for the first reactor and then it was going to come down. We have an entire cost curve. I’d say that the vast majority of Wall Street as well as the reactor construction folks believe that cost curve, right?

So whether or not it’s true, I can’t tell you, but I think that they think that it was thoughtful and that we made it high enough that they actually thought that if you took the best practices approach, that that is the best case scenario that you could see. And that shows that we never get to Chinese numbers, we never get to like $4,000 of kW. We get down to like $8,000 of kW in the west.

And so the other thing I would say though is with Kairos and then some of the microreactors, so think Oklo, Radiant, some of those types of folks, they really are a manufactured product. So they are a twenty-foot shipping container. You would create a manufacturing facility, you would create a hundred reactors a year that came out of that manufacturing facility, which is similar to offshore wind.

Offshore wind are very complex units, and the manufacturing facilities for offshore wind make 50 of those like nacelles a year. They’re manufactured, but they’re complex. So we have experience on how to do that kind of manufacturing, which could drive down the cost. And so I am bullish on the cost structure. I think that we can consistently get to pick a number, let’s say 9.9 cents a kilowatt-hour. I don’t think it ever gets to 2 cents a kilowatt-hour.

And then remember, the way that nuclear is financed is that these reactors will last 60, the current fleet of reactors now have been permitted to 80 years. And so the cost structure I’m talking about is only for during the first 30 years, right? When the loan program’s office provides a loan, et cetera. So as soon as you pay off the loan, then you drop to where nuclear power plants are today that are on the grid, which are like three and a half to 4 cents a kilowatt-hour depending on whose math you’re using and which reactors.

The last thing I would say is that the value of nuclear is very high. So when you look at the decarbonization scenarios from NREL, the cost of a high clean firm grid is 37% cheaper than a high solar and wind grid. Because you have to build so much transmission, you’d have to 3X the transmission grid to be able to handle 80% solar and wind power with battery storage. And so you can have high specific generating costs while reducing overall system costs. And so that’s important.

And then one more point is people have been talking a lot about the PJM auction and how the costs have come way up and it’s impacted prices in New Jersey and Maryland. The one place in the PJM where you did not see spikes in the capacity auction Illinois. Why? Because it’s 70% nuclear. So part of the challenge here is thinking this through from a systemic point of view. And so I think you could see nuclear continue to be high cost, let’s call it a hundred dollars a megawatt-hour, and still see lower overall decarbonization costs for our entire grid.

Stephen Lacey: All right, Jigar, we’re going to let you go off to RE+, what are you going to do today? You’re not going to sit in the casino, right? You’re going to actually go talk to people.

Jigar Shah: Well, honestly, I am going to hang out with Neil Chatterjee who’s here, whose Fox News piece, by the way, two days ago was a masterstroke in politics.

Stephen Lacey: I didn’t see it.

Jigar Shah: He wrote this great news piece on Fox News that talks about how Trump’s energy policy is going to drive a wedge between Silicon Valley and MAGA, which I thought was a fascinating political analysis. So I’d have everybody watch and read that. And I’m going to go see our friend Nico at the SunCast stage and do his podcast.

And so, I’m super excited about all of the folks who have boosts on the trade show. I am one of those people who always walks the trade show floor just because I find all the cool stuff that people are doing to just be so inspiring. And so I’m going to let myself be inspired.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, good luck at Cornell.

Katherine Hamilton: Thanks so much. Ithaca is gorgeous. So if you like anything about geothermal, that’s the place to go and I can’t wait.

FAQs About Green Lithium for EV Batteries What makes lithium production ""green"" compared to conventional methods?","What is Green Lithium and Why Does it Matter for EVs?

The global transition to electric vehicles continues to accelerate, with EV sales reaching 10.5 million units in 2022 – a remarkable 55% increase from the previous year. As this shift progresses, the environmental footprint of EV production has come under increasing scrutiny, particularly the materials used in battery manufacturing, which can account for up to 40% of an EV's total lifecycle emissions.

Green lithium for EV batteries represents a fundamental shift in how this critical battery material is sourced and processed. Unlike conventional lithium production, which often involves extensive environmental disruption, green lithium prioritizes sustainability throughout the supply chain while delivering the same high-performance battery materials.

The Environmental Imperative Behind Green Lithium

The rapid growth of the EV market has created unprecedented demand for lithium, with projections suggesting a potential 500% increase in lithium requirements by 2030. This demand surge has highlighted the unsustainable nature of traditional lithium extraction methods, which often consume massive water resources in drought-prone regions and generate significant carbon emissions.

Industry leaders like Vulcan Energy's CEO Cris Moreno emphasize the critical importance of developing ""local, low-cost sources of sustainable lithium for European EV batteries,"" reflecting the growing recognition that EVs can only deliver their full environmental promise when their component materials are responsibly sourced.

Defining the Green Lithium Difference

Green lithium is characterized by extraction and processing methods that minimize ecological impact through reduced water usage, lower carbon emissions, and decreased chemical pollution. Key differentiating factors include:

Use of renewable energy throughout the production process

Implementation of water-efficient extraction technologies

Reduced land disturbance compared to traditional methods

Decreased or eliminated dependence on harsh chemical reagents

Regional production that minimizes transportation emissions

These sustainable approaches maintain the same chemical purity and performance characteristics as conventionally produced lithium while dramatically reducing environmental impact. The successful production of Europe's first domestically manufactured lithium hydroxide by Vulcan Energy in November 2024 demonstrated that green lithium can meet rigorous quality standards while adhering to strict sustainability principles.

How Traditional Lithium Production Impacts the Environment

Before examining green lithium solutions, it's essential to understand the environmental challenges posed by conventional lithium production methods that have dominated the industry for decades.

Water-Intensive Extraction Methods

Traditional lithium extraction from salt flat brines through evaporation ponds represents one of the most water-intensive mining operations globally. These operations typically consume between 500,000 and 2,000,000 liters of water per tonne of lithium produced – a staggering volume that has severe implications for local ecosystems and communities.

This water consumption becomes particularly problematic considering that approximately 75% of global lithium reserves are located in the ""Lithium Triangle"" of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile – a region already experiencing significant water stress. In Chile's Atacama Desert, lithium operations have been linked to declining water tables, soil degradation, and ecosystem disruption in one of the world's driest environments.

The carbon intensity of traditional lithium production contributes significantly to battery manufacturing emissions:

Hard rock mining requires energy-intensive crushing and heating processes

Conversion of lithium concentrate to battery-grade lithium compounds involves multiple chemical processing steps

Global transportation of raw materials and refined products adds substantial emissions

Chemical reagents used in processing carry their own embedded carbon footprint

Studies indicate that conventional lithium production can generate between 5-15 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per tonne of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), representing a significant portion of an EV battery's total carbon footprint.

Land Use and Ecosystem Disruption

Traditional lithium operations frequently involve extensive land disturbance:

Evaporation ponds can span thousands of hectares, with the Atacama operations covering over 80 km²

Hard rock mining creates significant surface disruption, including pit development and tailings storage

Road construction and infrastructure development fragment habitats

Chemical contamination can affect soil and water quality beyond operational boundaries

These impacts can persist long after mining operations cease, creating lasting ecological damage that requires extensive remediation efforts.

What Innovative Technologies Are Making Green Lithium Possible?

The transition to green lithium is being driven by several breakthrough technologies that fundamentally reimagine how lithium is extracted and processed.

Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) Breakthroughs

Direct Lithium Extraction represents one of the most promising advances in green lithium production. These technologies selectively extract lithium from brines without requiring extensive evaporation ponds, delivering multiple environmental benefits:

Water consumption reductions of up to 90% compared to traditional evaporation methods

Land footprint reduced by approximately 70% through elimination of large evaporation ponds

Processing time shortened from 18 months to as little as a few hours

Increased recovery rates – typically 70-90% versus 30-40% for traditional methods

Reduced chemical usage and waste generation

Several DLE approaches are gaining commercial traction, including ion-exchange resins, solvent extraction systems, and selective adsorption technologies, each offering specific advantages for different brine compositions and operational contexts.

Electrolysis-Based Processing Innovations

Advanced electrolysis systems are transforming lithium processing by enabling the production of battery-grade lithium compounds using renewable electricity rather than chemical reagents. NESI's NORSCAND® Electrolysers exemplify this approach, using specialized electrodes from Permascand AB to produce high-purity lithium hydroxide through an electrochemical process.

Key advantages of electrolysis-based processing include:

Elimination of most chemical reagents used in traditional processing

Direct production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide without intermediate steps

Compatibility with renewable energy sources, enabling carbon-neutral processing

Reduced waste generation and simplified waste management

Higher product purity with fewer impurities

The successful implementation of this technology at Vulcan Energy's Central Lithium Electrolysis Optimisation Plant (CLEOP) demonstrated its commercial viability, producing Europe's first domestically manufactured lithium hydroxide in November 2024.

Geothermal Lithium Recovery

Emerging geothermal lithium extraction projects tap into naturally occurring lithium-rich brines that are already being pumped as part of geothermal energy production. This approach offers several unique advantages:

Utilizes existing geothermal infrastructure, reducing capital requirements

Produces renewable energy simultaneously with lithium extraction

Avoids additional land disturbance beyond existing geothermal operations

Leverages natural heat to enhance lithium extraction efficiency

Creates potential for carbon-negative lithium production when CO₂ sequestration is incorporated

These geothermal lithium projects are advancing particularly in the Rhine Valley of Germany, California's Salton Sea, and Cornwall in the United Kingdom, where appropriate geological conditions coincide with growing lithium demand.

How Are Companies Implementing Green Lithium Solutions?

Theoretical innovations are rapidly translating into commercial operations as companies race to establish sustainable lithium supply chains.

Vulcan Energy's Zero-Carbon Lithium Project

Vulcan Energy's integrated geothermal energy and lithium extraction project in Germany's Upper Rhine Valley represents a pioneering approach to green lithium production. The company's ""Zero Carbon Lithium"" process extracts lithium from geothermal brines while simultaneously generating renewable geothermal energy.

Key features of this project include:

Co-production of renewable geothermal energy and battery-grade lithium

Carbon-neutral or potentially carbon-negative production process

Regional supply chain development reducing transportation emissions

Enhanced European resource security through domestic production

Minimal land and water requirements compared to traditional methods

This approach has attracted significant attention from European automakers seeking to reduce the carbon footprint of their supply chains while securing reliable material sources.

The Vulcan-NESI Partnership for European Green Lithium

Vulcan Energy's contract with NESI for their Phase One Lionheart Project marks a significant advancement in European green lithium production. This partnership will implement NESI's NORSCAND® Electrolysers at Vulcan's Central Lithium Plant in Frankfurt, enabling the production of high-purity lithium hydroxide using renewable energy sources.

The collaboration builds on the successful operation of Vulcan's Central Lithium Electrolysis Optimisation Plant (CLEOP), which produced Europe's first domestically manufactured lithium hydroxide in late 2024. Key components of this partnership include:

Technology transfer encompassing the NORSCAND® Electrolysers system

Comprehensive services including process engineering and commissioning support

Electrode supply from Swedish manufacturer Permascand AB

Integration with Industrial Park Höchst infrastructure in Frankfurt

Construction timeline commencing in H2 2025

This project represents a crucial step in establishing European lithium independence while maintaining strict environmental standards.

International Collaborations for Sustainable Supply Chains

The Germany-Canada Joint Declaration of Intent exemplifies the growing international cooperation around sustainable critical minerals. Signed in September 2025, this agreement aims to secure green lithium supply chains while accelerating clean energy transitions in both countries.

Such governmental partnerships provide essential support for private sector innovations through:

Regulatory harmonization facilitating international project development

Research funding for emerging green technologies

Market incentives for sustainable material sourcing

Public-private partnerships addressing infrastructure needs

Long-term policy stability enhancing investment confidence

These collaborative approaches recognize that sustainable lithium production requires coordinated efforts across national boundaries, with governments increasingly viewing green lithium as a strategic priority for both environmental and economic reasons.

What Benefits Does Green Lithium Offer for EV Manufacturing?

The adoption of green lithium delivers multiple advantages for EV manufacturers beyond environmental considerations.

Green lithium for EV batteries significantly reduces the embedded carbon in EV batteries, which can account for up to 40% of a vehicle's lifetime emissions. By implementing sustainable extraction and processing methods, manufacturers can reduce the carbon intensity of lithium by 50-90% compared to conventional sources.

This reduction delivers several benefits:

Enhanced environmental credibility for EV products

Improved lifecycle emissions profile for regulatory compliance

Potential carbon credit generation in certain jurisdictions

Alignment with corporate sustainability commitments

Competitive advantage with environmentally conscious consumers

As automotive manufacturers face increasing pressure to reduce scope 3 emissions (those from their supply chain), green lithium represents an important opportunity to address a significant emissions source.

Supply Chain Resilience and Regional Security

Localized green lithium production enhances supply chain resilience by reducing dependence on concentrated production regions. This diversification helps manufacturers:

Mitigate geopolitical risks associated with resource concentration

Reduce transportation costs and associated emissions

Decrease vulnerability to regional disruptions

Establish shorter, more transparent supply chains

Support domestic economic development and employment

The European focus on developing regional lithium production capacity, exemplified by Vulcan Energy's German operations, reflects growing recognition that battery material security represents a strategic imperative for the continent's automotive industry.

Marketing and Regulatory Advantages

As consumers and regulators increasingly prioritize sustainability, EVs powered by green lithium offer manufacturers significant marketing advantages:

Enhanced brand positioning with environmentally conscious consumers

Compliance with emerging supply chain due diligence requirements

Alignment with sustainability-linked financing opportunities

Preparation for future carbon border adjustment mechanisms

Compatibility with emerging battery passport regulations

These advantages become increasingly valuable as markets differentiate between EVs based on their full environmental footprint rather than simply comparing them to internal combustion alternatives.

How Does Green Lithium Compare Economically to Traditional Sources?

The economic viability of green lithium represents a crucial factor in its widespread adoption.

Cost Comparison and Long-Term Economics

While green lithium technologies often require higher initial capital investment, their operational economics increasingly compete with traditional methods:

DLE technologies reduce operational expenses through faster processing times

Reduced land requirements decrease leasing and remediation costs

Decreased chemical inputs lower ongoing material expenses

Higher recovery rates improve resource utilization efficiency

Integrated energy production can offset operating costs in geothermal projects

These operational advantages increasingly offset higher capital costs, particularly as technologies mature and achieve economies of scale. Additionally, as carbon pricing mechanisms expand globally, the economic advantages of low-carbon lithium production are expected to increase substantially.

Premium Market Positioning

Green lithium commands growing premium pricing in certain markets, particularly among luxury and sustainability-focused EV manufacturers. This premium, currently estimated at 10-15% above conventional lithium prices, provides additional economic incentives for producers investing in sustainable technologies.

Several factors drive this premium pricing:

Brand value enhancement for premium EV manufacturers

Corporate sustainability commitments requiring verifiable low-carbon materials

Emerging regulatory advantages for demonstrably sustainable supply chains

Consumer willingness to pay for environmentally responsible products

Potential carbon credit generation in applicable markets

This price premium helps offset the potentially higher production costs of green lithium while the technologies continue to mature and achieve economies of scale.

Investment Trends and Market Growth

Investment in green lithium technologies has accelerated dramatically, with venture capital and public market funding for sustainable lithium projects increasing over 300% since 2020. This investment surge reflects growing confidence in both the technological viability and market demand for environmentally responsible lithium production.

Key investment trends include:

Major automotive manufacturers taking equity positions in green lithium producers

Sovereign wealth funds prioritizing sustainable resource development

Venture capital targeting early-stage extraction technology innovations

Public markets rewarding companies with clear sustainability credentials

Government support through grants, loan guarantees, and tax incentives

These investment flows are enabling the rapid commercialization of technologies that might otherwise remain at pilot scale for extended periods, accelerating the industry's sustainable transformation.

What Challenges Remain for Green Lithium Adoption?

Despite promising advances, several significant challenges must be overcome to enable widespread green lithium adoption.

Scaling Technologies from Pilot to Commercial Production

“Resource planning is critical for evaluating the energy resources that will be most beneficial for customers.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Today, the Iowa Utilities Commission approved a settlement between MidAmerican Energy and stakeholder parties, including Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), Iowa Environmental Council (IEC), and Sierra Club, to authorize 800 megawatts of solar in Iowa. This is the largest solar approval in state history and would quintuple MidAmerican’s existing solar resources. MidAmerican expects the project to produce enough energy to power 144,000 homes.

When assessing different energy resources, MidAmerican’s predictive modeling concluded that expanding the utility’s solar fleet was the most cost-effective choice for customers. The environmental groups conducted their own modeling that confirmed solar as a good option in a range of future electricity cost and demand growth scenarios.

“Building solar is a no-regrets choice for Iowans: It provides consistent, clean power and moves Iowa toward a renewable energy future,” said Josh Mandelbaum, Senior Attorney at ELPC. “This proposal balances MidAmerican’s wind generation fleet to reduce reliance on its polluting coal plants.”

The settlement was unanimously supported among parties participating in the case. It provides advance approval for reasonable costs to build the solar generation and comes as federal tax credits for clean energy projects are close to expiring.

“Solar is a cost-effective resource even without tax credits, but the opportunity to use tax credits for this project makes it a clear win for Iowa customers,” said Steve Guyer, Senior Energy Policy Counsel at IEC. “Our vision for 100% renewable energy in Iowa is one step closer.”

The environmental groups have encouraged MidAmerican to expand its solar resources for several years, including in prior cases. The groups collaborated with other parties in the docket to reach agreement on a future resource planning process, which will provide an opportunity to consider rapidly changing conditions in the energy sector.

“Resource planning is critical for evaluating the energy resources that will be most beneficial for customers. The improved planning process laid out in the settlement ensures involvement for stakeholders and requires MidAmerican to evaluate coal plant retirements and affordable clean energy replacement options,” said Josh Smith, Senior Attorney at Sierra Club. “Iowa communities deserve to know what to expect. This planning process will provide needed transparency into the direction of Iowa’s energy generation.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-12 11:01:02.224731

You’ve probably noticed more electric vehicles (EVs) on the road lately. You might have even thought about buying one yourself. But with prices fluctuating, federal incentives expiring soon and new models launching frequently, it’s hard to know if now is a good time to buy.

Buy now and you might miss out on better technology or lower prices in the future. Wait and you could miss out on the current rebates and incentives. It’s a bit like trying to time the stock market. Keep reading as we look into whether now is a good time to buy an electric vehicle or if it makes more sense to wait.

Also here are EV expenses you may not be aware of.

EV Adoption and Trends

EVs are quickly growing in numbers on the road. According to Rho Motion, approximately 9.1 million electric cars were sold worldwide in the first half of 2025. This is a 28% increase over the first half of 2024. Why is this trend happening? Part of it is because more manufacturers are releasing new electric models, which gives buyers more options to choose from.

Additionally, charging stations are being installed in more convenient locations. Larger cities have them at grocery stores, shopping malls and even in parking lots across town. They can even be found at larger office buildings. However, even though the number of charging stations is increasing, things aren’t ideal for everyone. Small towns have fewer options, making it crucial that owners can charge at home.

One of the biggest issues that’s kept people from purchasing an electric vehicle in the past has been battery technology. But even that’s improving. New electric models can go further without needing a charge. This makes them good for not only city driving, but also people looking to travel out of town.

Reasons To Buy Now

If you’ve been considering an electric car, there are a few reasons why you might want to buy now rather than waiting.

Incentives and rebates: Depending on where you live, your state may have rebates available for electric vehicles. Plus, federal rebates currently offer $7,500 when you purchase a new electric vehicle or $4,000 when you buy used. However, because of the Big Beautiful Bill, these federal rebates will expire on Sept. 30, 2025.

Lower Costs to Run: With the average price of gas being over $3.00 per gallon (per AAA), it’s cheaper for most people to run an electric car as long as you have the ability to charge at home.

Technology Has Improved: Range has always been one of the key reasons why people haven’t made the change from gas to electric. However, new technology has increased the range electric cars can make it without needing a charge.

“Now is a good time to buy an EV,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book (KBB). “There’s a greater choice than ever before. There are various discounts and rebates available, some are regional, some are national. Also, the popularity of some EV models is declining so a little research by the shopper could end up getting them an exceptional deal.”

Reasons To Wait

While there are many reasons why people might want to buy an electric vehicle now, some people might find it better to wait.

Technology continues to improve: Even though technology has improved, delaying your purchase might lead to further improvements. The driving range could improve even more and charging could become faster, all of which drivers desire most.

Drop in prices: As more car manufacturers continue to release electric models, prices could fall even further.

Home charging not available: One of the biggest reasons why a potential buyer might want to wait is that they don’t have access to home charging. This can significantly increase the costs of ownership.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/automobile-car-artificial-intelligence-concept_iStock-1946362176.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 09:58:43.297152

Corporate silence on climate policy puts profits and people at risk

The US Environmental Protection Agency recently announced a proposal to end the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.

Known as the “endangerment finding” and often cited as the legal bedrock for addressing global warming, officials are reconsidering the basic premise that carbon and methane pollution threatens public health.

By seeking to overturn the only rule that allows for the limiting of planet-warming GHG emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas wells under the Clean Air Act, it would end the EPA’s ability to fight and mitigate climate change.

This latest move reminds us that the climate crisis is ultimately a political crisis. The oil and gas lobby, via the Donald Trump administration 2.0, continues to dominate US politics and would have us ignore science and our senses all in the service of maximising profit, while destroying clean air, public health and the environment in the process.

It also follows a long string of anti-climate efforts by the government to cut federal climate science research, repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy provisions, withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and repeal dozens of regulations that aim to keep America’s water and air pollution at bay.

However, the proposed endangerment finding repeal moves beyond predictable regulatory rollbacks and attacks the scientific foundation for climate action.

It is also a deliberate blow to the moral and legal bedrocks of the environmental protection the EPA is tasked with upholding. After all, the EPA’s mission is to protect human health and the environment.

This strategy . . . underscores the administration’s willingness to manipulate our collective understanding of reality

While the government and the polluting oil majors may want us to believe that climate change and the associated pollution pose no threat to public health or the environment, the persistent realities of air pollution and increasingly common extreme weather events such as heatwaves, wildfires and floods persist.

For anyone who has read George Orwell’s 1984, the new administration’s climate denialist moves might remind you of this quote: “The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command.”

This strategy to discredit and undermine climate science and climate action underscores the administration’s willingness to manipulate our collective understanding of reality in service of a broader political and economic agenda that sides with polluters over people.

It is up to us to come to our (literal) senses, wake up and recognise that EPA administrator Lee Zeldin’s chaotic plans make climate denial official US policy.

At risk are even further accelerated climate destabilisation and the health and safety of millions of Americans.

Corporate silence

For more than 15 years, the endangerment finding has limited planet-warming GHG emissions from the oil and gas, power and transportation sectors. Many companies moved to invest in clean tech and emissions reduction strategies, especially given the private sector’s understanding of the inherent material risks of climate change to business.

According to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Business Breakthrough Barometer report, 61 per cent of company leaders predict that increased costs from climate-related disruptions will impact their business, and nine out of 10 companies say they will maintain or increase their transition-related investments and emissions targets.

Businesses know climate change is not going away, despite what American politicians suggest.

Some chief executives are choosing not to break with reality, recognising that the EPA’s move on the endangerment finding is “endangering” US businesses on climate.

Beyond companies simply continuing to do the work of meeting climate commitments quietly — many of which have been driven by concern for the bottom line — businesses should move into more forceful advocacy despite political risks.

Why? If the endangerment finding is repealed and if climate denialism continues to dominate US policy, there will probably be increased legal risk, regulatory disruptions and uncertainty, and the potential for American businesses to fall behind as markets globally continue the shift towards emissions reductions and a cleaner energy economy.

Companies once seen as potential climate leaders, such as Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce, should be using their lobbying power and political influence

Companies have invested billions in renewables — with those investments now at risk from ongoing policy uncertainty — and even most oil and gas companies support a national approach to limiting methane.

Businesses should be speaking up now for long-term regulatory stability and US competitiveness globally. Company leaders should remember commitments to shareholders, employees, customers and American communities.

The attacks on climate action will not slow the realities of climate change, or the associated risks. It is beyond time for companies to wield their influence on climate policy — especially those that recognise the very real material risks involved and who have made strong commitments to act.

For example, companies once seen as potential climate leaders, such as Apple, Microsoft and Salesforce, should be using their lobbying power and political influence to change the corporate climate landscape. With the complete absence of government leadership, there is even more of an imperative for businesses to act.

ClimateVoice continues to call on companies to lobby for climate solutions and publicly endorse climate policies.

Public comments to the EPA defending the endangerment finding can be submitted until September 22. Businesses can urge the EPA to maintain the endangerment finding to ensure a stable policy environment supporting long-term business planning and economic growth, while advancing a cleaner energy future.

Business leaders should band together and advocate openly through public statements and strong lobbying forces, along with urging trade groups to oppose rollbacks.

Companies must urgently consider their role at this critical moment, and end the trend towards corporate silence and complicity in an anti-climate agenda.

Silence will not lead us to a better future. Practising corporate political responsibility and moral courage will, if we act now.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/e442ea64-1b5f-4d18-a9e6-301eb9f8128c.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 07:59:25.621874

. As the EV market matures, Rivian's dual focus on commercial and defense sectors has created a unique first-mover advantage, one that could redefine its role in the broader EV ecosystem. By securing high-profile partnerships with and in the commercial space and laying the groundwork for military applications, Rivian is not merely selling vehicles—it is shaping the infrastructure and workforce of the future.

Commercial EVs: A Proven Track Record

Rivian's commercial EV strategy has been nothing short of aggressive. The company's partnership with Amazon, which includes a landmark order for 100,000 electric delivery vans, has already delivered over 10,000 units to the e-commerce giant's fleetLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ]. This collaboration is not just a win for Rivian's bottom line but a testament to its ability to scale production and infrastructure.

Walmart's commitment to acquiring 4,500 Rivian electric delivery vans further underscores the company's dominance in this spaceLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ]. These partnerships are not accidental; they reflect Rivian's ability to align with corporate sustainability goals while delivering vehicles that meet the rigorous demands of commercial fleets. As of 2025, Rivian's commercial van is available to fleets of all sizes, signaling a shift from exclusive partnerships to broader market penetrationRivian Opens Sales of the Rivian Commercial Van to Fleets of All Sizes in the U.S.[ 3 ].

Defense Sector: A Quiet but Strategic Push

While Rivian's commercial success is well-documented, its foray into the defense sector remains less visible but no less significant. The U.S. military's growing interest in electrification—driven by the need for quieter, more sustainable, and less fuel-dependent operations—has opened a new frontier for EV manufacturers. Rivian's R1T and R1S models, with their 400+ mile range and 835 horsepower, are technically well-suited for military applicationsLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ].

Though specific defense contracts remain undisclosed, Rivian's engagement with military stakeholders is evident. The Pentagon and Detroit automakers are collaborating to modernize the military's vehicle fleet, and Rivian's electric platforms are under consideration for both tactical and non-tactical rolesLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ]. Additionally, Rivian's $6.6 billion federal loan for its Georgia plant$6.6B federal loan for Rivian's Georgia plant finalized[ 4 ] provides the financial runway to pivot toward defense contracts if the opportunity arises. The company's recent workforce development initiatives, such as the Rivian Mobile Service Technician training program at Fort Benning Army Base and partnerships with Tidewater Community College$6.6B federal loan for Rivian's Georgia plant finalized[ 4 ], further signal its intent to integrate into the defense supply chain. These programs not only prepare veterans for EV careers but also create a pipeline of skilled technicians who could support military EV maintenance.

First-Mover Advantage: A Double-Edged Sword

Rivian's early lead in commercial EVs has positioned it as a critical player in the transition to electrification. However, the company's success hinges on its ability to maintain this momentum. Competitors like

The company's focus on high-margin offerings—such as its direct sales model and premium fleet solutionsLeading EV Stocks List 2025 - Electric Vehicles[ 1 ]—suggests a strategy of differentiation rather than price competition, a tactic that could serve it well in both commercial and defense markets.

Conclusion

Rivian's strategic position in the EV ecosystem is defined by its ability to bridge commercial and defense markets. While its commercial partnerships have already validated its first-mover advantage, the defense sector represents an untapped opportunity—one that requires both technological adaptability and political capital. As the EV industry evolves, Rivian's success will depend on its capacity to translate its commercial credibility into military contracts and to scale its workforce development initiatives. For investors, the company's dual focus on sustainability and national security offers a compelling narrative—one that could drive long-term value in an increasingly electrified world.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1757645067448.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-12 12:05:21.636688

The company has already introduced a number of sustainability initiatives, including the switch to 100 per cent recycled plastic for bottled drinks produced on the island of Ireland.

General manager Simon Fitzpatrick described the introduction of biomethane as 'a significant milestone' in the company’s decarbonisation plans.

He said the decision to work with a local supplier also supported the development of renewable energy within Northern Ireland.

“While things are ever-evolving in D.C., it is our understanding that the schools … will be able to access those federal tax credits and be able to save even more money,” said Pennsylvania state Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, who sponsored the Solar for Schools legislation.

Allegheny County schools lead the state in potential for solar energy generation, advocates report

‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ casts shade over Pennsylvania’s solar boom

Pennsylvania’s Solar for Schools program awarded its first round of grant funding to 74 schools this spring. The program helps districts pay for the up-front costs of solar installations that will lower their utility bills in the long term.

Districts were expected to use the state money to take advantage of a federal solar tax credit, which became available to schools for the first time through former President Joe Biden’s climate law.

Fiedler’s office had said that by combining the state grants with the federal tax credit, schools could install solar arrays for free or a fraction of the usual cost.

Rooftop solar tax credits to expire with enough time for schools to install panels

Despite fears that Congress would pass a bill that would have killed the tax credits before the end of the year, a version of the tax bill that ultimately became law gives districts until next summer to start building their projects or start running them by the end of 2027, to still claim the credit.

“That’s not a rush,” said Micah Gold-Markel, founder of Philly-based solar energy installer Solar States. “We can get solar projects started in as little as two weeks. So, to start construction in a year and finish it in two years, that’s easily doable.”

The School District of Philadelphia is still pursuing its Solar for Schools projects, said spokesperson Christina Clark. The district plans to install solar panels at W.B. Saul High School, Northeast Community Propel Academy, Andrew Hamilton Elementary School and Murrell Dobbins CTE High School.

A report released by the nonprofit PennEnvironment found that if all roughly 5,000 of Pennsylvania’s schools installed solar panels, they could produce enough electricity to power around 187,000 homes per year, reduce planet-warming carbon emissions by as much as taking 300,000 cars off of roads and save schools more than $300 million over the lifetime of the solar energy systems.

In reality, fewer than half of the schools in the state would likely be capable of hosting solar on their rooftops, and even fewer would be able to install solar without first upgrading their roofs or electrical systems, Gold-Markel said.

PennEnvironment recommended policy changes that could make it easier for schools to actually install solar, including grants that cover roofing and electrical system upgrades.

“It’s clear that going solar is good for the environment, schools and students, and taking full advantage of Pennsylvania’s solar school potential requires supportive policies at every level of government,” said Flora Cardoni, deputy director of PennEnvironment.

Fiedler wants to see a second round of Solar for Schools funding included in the overdue state budget. She said even after the federal tax credit expires, the program will still benefit schools.

“Everyone who pays an energy bill is aware that energy prices are going up,” Fiedler said. “So everyone is trying to save money where they can, and the sun that’s up there waiting for us to harness its energy is a pretty good place.”

“There is huge demand for this program,” she added. “We believe that that’s going to continue.”",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/climate-change-pa-farmers-6-solar-panel-768x511.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-09-12 07:59:29.981618
