Photos and videos are available in the Greenpeace Media Library.

The messages Greenpeace Brazil projected on the Congress building and on buildings across Brasília, where delegates are meeting, read “COP 30: Act for forests, act for climate” in English; “COP30: Protejam as florestas” in Portuguese.

A staggering 86% of people surveyed in 17 countries across five continents believe that protecting forests is critical in the fight against climate change, according to the new poll, released today, commissioned by Greenpeace International and conducted by Opinium [1]. Results also showed that 82% of people want their governments to take more action on forests, showing overwhelming public support to halt deforestation.

An Lambrechts, Biodiversity Policy Expert, Greenpeace International said: “If we want to keep 1.5°C within sight, COP30 will need to deliver an action plan to end forest destruction by 2030. These poll results show that many people understand the urgency and want governments to act. There is no better moment than at a COP in the Amazon to do so.”

The polling was released during the pre-COP in Brasília, where country delegations, Indigenous communities and civil society are meeting ahead of the UNFCCC COP30 to prepare COP outcomes, including on the need to address climate change and biodiversity loss hand in hand.

Poll respondents expressed wanting to see their governments increasingly addressing forest destruction. Additionally, most agree that the most effective results can be achieved with global cooperation through international agreements to end deforestation (77%), and to commit to a new action plan to halt the destruction of forests and other ecosystems (75%). When it comes to forest protection, respondents place the most confidence in Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (78%), well above national governments (49%) or corporations (42%). 75% agree that Indigenous Peoples should receive funding to protect forests.

Carolina Pasquali, Executive Director, Greenpeace Brazil said: “This overwhelming public support sends a powerful message to governments ahead of COP30, which takes place for the first time in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. World leaders must listen to their people and act on their moral, legal and political responsibilities to end deforestation in order to hold on to the 1.5°C ambition.”

Kleber Karipuna, Executive Coordinator of the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (Apib) said: “This is a significant survey as it expresses not only the opinion of the vast majority of the population on the importance of keeping forests and all biomes standing and preserved, but also reveals society’s trust in Indigenous Peoples to protect the planet’s biodiversity. Science has already proven that Indigenous Peoples are the true guardians of the forest. Now, society is reaffirming this and warning that demarcating and protecting our territories is an effective and crucial policy for combating deforestation and confronting the global climate crisis, because we are the answer.”

For successful forest protection, Greenpeace calls on global leaders at Pre-COP to:

Act on their commitments and the UNFCCC target to halt deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, with a decision that goes beyond voluntary pledges [2].

Provide direct funding for Indigenous Peoples’ and Local Communities’ solutions to protect and restore forests.

Regulate and stop funding those who profit from forest destruction.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/California_Oil_Workers_71412.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 14:01:59.700719

I want to take it back, I was wrong. Not just because UCLA went on to crush Michigan State for its second consecutive win — I guess the Bruins’ interim offensive coordinator figured out how to use his headset — but Northwestern beat Penn State yesterday, and as a Northwestern fan, I now feel strongly that it’s important to celebrate the team that pulls off an upset instead of just crapping all over the team that lost.

Is Penn State really in total freefall, or was it just outfoxed by the mighty Wildcat defense? Come on, guys! Isn’t it more fun to talk about how Northwestern’s offense is clicking with Preston Stone and Griffin Wilde than something boring like James Franklin’s job status? Guys? GUYS?!?!??!?!?!

HOOSIER DADDY

Four years ago, in the midst of a 38-3 loss to Rutgers, several hundred Indiana students ripped off their shirts and began jumping around the completely empty upper deck of Memorial Stadium, overcome with mass-onset Hoosier Madness:

That moment was easily the most most memorable thing about the 2021 Indiana Hoosiers, who finished 2-10 and 0-9 in conference play. Indiana experienced a glimmer of relevance during the 2020 COVID season, but it was still the losingest program in college football history, without a bowl win since 1991. The Hoosiers had no hope and no ambition — nothing to do except rip their shirts off and mosh, as far away as possible from the actual football taking place on the field.

Four years later, Indiana is still the losingest program in college football history, and it still hasn’t won a bowl game since 1991. And yet the undefeated Hoosiers have arguably the strongest resume of any team in the country. They are virtual locks to play in the Big Ten championship and the College Football Playoff after comfortably defeating #3 Oregon in Eugene.

The win was Indiana’s first over a Top 5 opponent since 1967. It had gone 0-46 against Top 5 competition over the previous 58 years. And the Hoosiers didn’t win a flukey, NCAA Tournament-style upset in which the underdog keeps hitting threes and the better team keeps missing layups. (Basketball terms for our adapting Hoosier friends.) Indiana was simply the better team. The Hoosiers moved the ball consistently, tracked down Oregon quarterback Dante Moore like Hoosier homing missiles, and stoned the Ducks in multiple short-yardage scenarios. If not for an atypical Fernando Mendoza pick-six, literally his first interception of the year, the game wouldn’t have been particularly close.

Indiana’s overnight leap in success from 2023 to 2024 was one of the biggest in college football history. Curt Cignetti and his transfers took Indiana to the College Football Playoff out of nowhere in their first year in Bloomington. But Indiana may have taken a bigger leap in Year 2, going from a solid team that was clearly outclassed by the best programs in the sport to a legit national title contender.

Going from bad to good quickly has happened before. Going from good to elite typically takes significantly longer, and requires major structural changes. Just ask Oregon, which has risen from football obscurity to powerhouse status through decades of strategic planning and billions of dollars invested by a single benefactor, the founder and CEO of the largest athletic clothing brand ever. Oregon couldn’t break through overnight. It has had to build wisely by hiring the right people and spending in the right ways, creating systems that would enable it to beat the best teams in the sport. In 2025, the Ducks looked as if they finally made it to the top: They had the right coach, who was able to land the best recruits from all over the country and get them to buy in.

And then Indiana came into their house and kicked their asses with a year-and-a-half of Curt Cignetti and nothing else. These Hoosiers aren’t the result of careful planning. They are just four years removed from being so directionless and incoherent that “shirtless dance party?” was a defining ethos.

Indiana can win the national championship. It hasn’t shown any flaws and, unlike last year, its schedule isn’t lacking. The Hoosiers entered this week as the #3 team in Bill Connelly’s SP+ ratings and just beat the #1 team on the road. Indiana’s opponents this year are 22-4 against Not Indiana, and 0-6 against Indiana.

I can’t explain how Indiana did it. I have no road map for the next team who wants to replicate its success, because there’s only one Curt Cignetti and Indiana already hired him. But Oklahoma State fans had the next-best idea this weekend: A random Shirtless Section during Saturday’s 39-17 loss to Houston in a cargo cult attempt at recreating Indiana’s rise.

See you in the 2030 national championship game, Pokes.

Fun fact about the Hoosier Madness incident: Our friend, Mr. Homefield Apparel, was in the crowd that day, watching all those freezing, frenzied students and all those Rutgers touchdowns:

It was that day that Mr. Homefield came up with an idea: What if people could cover their upper bodies in some form of garment? Perhaps made out some sort of cloth or fabric? Not only could these “shirts” provide warmth and comfort to the wearer, they could feature words or images that represent things the wearer is passionate about.

Everything has changed in the past few years. Indiana has become a national contender. Homefield’s invention of “shirts” has been copied by rival brands, but everybody agrees that they are the originator and the best. They’ve even expanded to products such as their new Homefield Varsity Jackets, which are SICK. (Oregon fans, cheer yourself up with that vintage Duck!)

Oops, they did it again

If its loss to UCLA was an alarm, Penn State hit snooze. It looked just as flat and lifeless against Northwestern as it did the week before. Perhaps even worse. The Nittany Lions started putting up points after falling into a hole against the Bruins. On Saturday they never woke up.

Penn State is now the first team ever to lose back-to-back games as a 20-point favorite. It won’t be a 20-point favorite again this season, especially after quarterback Drew Allar went down with a season-ending injury.

Normally, when I hear people doom-and-glooming about a couple of weird losses, I think they’re being overreactive … but considering the context around Penn State, the reaction feels appropriate. This season was supposed to be the culmination of talent and program-building under 12th-year head coach James Franklin. When I previewed Penn State for Split Zone Duo’s Big Ten preview, I saw a complete team with elite, experienced players at virtually every position. Allar seemed poised for a star turn in his final season after years of development. The biggest question mark was the receiver room, so Penn State spent big on multiple high-quality transfer receivers to plug the gap.

This season was everything Penn State was building towards … and in two weeks, it has crumbled and collapsed.

A Smart move

I’m trying to decide: Is Kirby Smart a liar, a genius, or a just really convincing salesman?

On a key third down in the fourth quarter against Auburn, Smart sprinted towards the officials signaling “timeout.” The refs granted Georgia a timeout with one second on the play clock, preventing a delay of game. However, Smart told the officials that he actually wasn’t timeout. He explained that he was just clapping at them, and in their confusion, they misinterpreted his hand gestures. The officials, remarkably, bought the explanation, and did not charge Georgia with a timeout. The Bulldogs got a fresh play clock, which is the intended effect of calling a timeout, without actually having to use one.

Here’s the weird thing: Smart may have been telling the truth. Yes, he was clearly running down the sidelines doing the “timeout” gesture. But he explained after the game that he was trying to tell the referees that Auburn players were clapping before the snap to trick Georgia into snapping the ball early, simulating the claps the Bulldogs were using to trigger the snap in a loud road environment. Smart said he alerted officials to Auburn’s use of this illegal trick before the game, and that he’d lost games at Auburn because of it. (Not sure which games Kirby is referring to, but Auburn did use a clap to trick Alabama into a bad snap during the Iron Bowl in 2023, setting up a fourth-and-31 … which Alabama famously converted!)

And sure enough, if you look at the play in question, Auburn defenders were clapping before the snap! The Tigers should’ve been given a five-yard penalty.

So I’m a little confused. On one hand, I believe Kirby Smart when he says he was trying to get in the refs’ ears about Auburn’s clapping. The Tigers clearly have a history of doing it, they were clearly doing it Saturday, and Smart is clearly fed up with it. I’m a little skeptical that Kirby would freak out so aggressively just to trick the refs into giving him one free timeout, especially with so much time remaining.

But on the other hand … we have the video, and he was clearly making the timeout gesture and not clapping.

One thing is clear: Auburn can’t stay away from bad officiating scenarios. It had a goal line QB sneak that kinda looked like a touchdown turn into a fumble on Saturday night. And of course, they were on the wrong end of this:

I guess Hugh Freeze freaking out at officials gives them the ick and convinces them to make even more calls against Auburn, and Kirby Smart freaking out at officials causes them to rethink the calls they’ve already made. A useful skill!

Oklahoma rushed QB John Mateer back from surgery on his throwing hand for the big Red River matchup with Texas … and he looked like a guy who got rushed back from surgery on his throwing hand as Oklahoma lost, 23-6.

UNLV stayed undefeated by beating Air Force, 51-48, and has a legit chance at the G6 spot in the College Football Playoff. Air Force is now dead last in the nation in total defense, allowing 497 yards per game. Honestly, I’m a bit worried about our national security at this point.

I’m not writing about the latest embarrassing Bill Belichick loss … because UNC was on bye. We’ll be back next week.

Boise State pulled off the extremely rare botched snap-to-touchdown pass Saturday night. I honestly can’t remember the last time I saw this …

This sort of thing used to happen more often when teams used backup quarterbacks to hold kicks in case the snap went bad and they needed a QB to make a play. But now teams use full-time long snappers who are almost always perfect, and most use a punter as the holder because it’s just easier to let the special teams guys hang out with each other in practice. Long story short: This was an Aussie Rules convert, Oscar Doyle, likely throwing a pass for the first time, under extreme duress … and dropping in a perfectly placed pass with touch on the run!

Oregon State wishes they could do this. The Beavers have had the most disastrous special teams season in recent memory with a variety of blocked kicks, allowed return touchdowns, and missed field goals. They tried to fix their problems by firing their special teams coordinator … and had yet another kick blocked on Saturday.

I’m still stumping for the two-QB offense. Look at this play Washington State ran for a touchdown against Ole Miss:

The ball was snapped to backup QB Julian Dugger, who handed it off to starter Zevi Eckhaus, who the defense clearly read as a runner rather than a QB. He briefly faked an option look before wheeling around and tossing a TD to a wide-open receiver.

Iowa State’s starting kicker was hurt entering Saturday, and then its backup kicker got hurt mid-game. So the Cyclones turned to Carson Rhodes, a 310-pound offensive lineman who punted and played soccer in high school.

Can we get any footage of this 310-pound guy playing soccer?

Kent State won its first game against another FBS team since 2022 … and it wasn’t close! The Golden Flashes beat UMass, 42-6. The winless Minutemen seem significantly worse than any other team at this level.","https://substackcdn.com/image/youtube/w_728,c_limit/ERo1bP2tDqs",N,,2025-10-12 14:02:39.022565

DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor Co. on Thursday said it won’t file for federal plug-in vehicle tax credits for transactions after the program’s deadline, following a similar decision by General Motors Co.

The Dearborn automaker will continue to offer its current lease rates to customers but will not claim the tax credit of up to $7,500. The incentive ended on Sept. 30, but Ford and GM through their finance arms found a workaround to extend that taxpayer-funded discount.

Following pressure from Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican and former auto dealer, to abandon the scheme, however, both companies have withdrawn their plans.

“Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today to continue providing customers with more affordable electric vehicle options,” Ford spokesperson Said Deep said in a statement. “For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0% financing for 72 months and other incentives.”

The automakers had their finance arms put down payments on dealers’ in-stock electric vehicles ahead of the deadline in an effort to extend the discount. CEO Jim Farley had characterized it as a way to “transition” customers away from the government incentive.

Now the companies will foot the discount themselves. Ford’s EV lease deals are expected to extend through the rest of the year.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that India will remain a major export hub for onshore wind components, underscoring the country's expanding role in the global renewable energy supply chain. ""Since 2023, the share of Western OEMs in the domestic market has declined sharply – from over 50% on average between 2018 and 2022 to below 5% – as their focus shifted to core US and European markets. This has left several gigawatts of manufacturing capacity underutilised and oriented towards exports. At the same time, Indian and Chinese manufacturers are planning expansions, says IEA. For the first time, large-scale supply contracts have been awarded to Chinese manufacturers in India and several other countries. India currently boasts more than 20GW of wind turbine manufacturing capacity, catering to both domestic demand and export markets. The country India has established itself as a global manufacturing hub for WTG components, with a strong supplier network and expanding capacities across key Tier 1 (nacelle, blade, tower) and Tier 2 (gearbox, generator, converter, casting) segments, ensuring global competitiveness, according to Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC). India stands at the threshold of becoming a global hub for wind manufacturing — where localisation goes beyond producing turbines and supply chain components for the domestic market. The focus is now on building global competitiveness through advanced capabilities, a skilled workforce, and strong local supply chains,"" Francis Jayasurya, director, GWEC India told TOI. Indian manufacturers account for about 12% of the global nacelle manufacturing capacity, contributing roughly 20GW out of a global total exceeding 165GW. In blade manufacturing, India holds a 10% share, with a capacity of around 16GW from a global base of more than 157GW. For towers, Indian firms contribute 13%, amounting to about 15GW of the global capacity exceeding 115GW. The country's strongest presence is in gearboxes, where it commands 17% of global capacity, equivalent to 29GW out of more than 170GW worldwide, says GWEC data. India aims for 500GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030, including 100GW from wind (30GW offshore). Coupled with expanding manufacturing and localisation, the country is set to meet domestic and export demand while strengthening its role in the global clean energy transition.

Houston has the worst power outages in the nation; how bad is it in your ZIP code? | KPRC Houston

Some zip codes in the Houston area had as many as seven outages in August. There were no hurricanes, no historic heat waves – just a lot of blue-sky outages.

In this story from KPRC, Senator Lois Kolkhorst pledged to do something about it. Good – except Senators said they’d do something about utility failures after Beryl and did very little.

It’s time the Legislature prioritizes pay for performance: give utilities both upside and downside risk based on the total amount of outages and speed to restore service after a storm.

I wrote about it after Hurricane Beryl a year ago:

The government’s own data rebuts Trump’s claims about wind and solar prices | Politico

The Administration continues to make demonstrably false claims about renewables. Politico did an excellent job putting together the evidence.

“Adding more wind and solar to the grid have one guaranteed effect: They make electricity more expensive,” Wright, a former oil industry CEO, told reporters last month in Washington.

But federal energy data undermines those arguments.

“I really think the data say pretty much the opposite” of Wright’s claims, said Joshua Rhodes, an electricity grid expert at the University of Texas-Austin whose research has found that renewable power has lowered electricity prices for customers in Texas, a state where wind and solar produce more than 30 percent of the state’s mix.

According to the EIA figures, Texas’ power cost an average of 10.24 cents per kilowatt-hour in June of this year. That price was lower than electricity costs in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and seven other Southern states. Only Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma had cheaper power in the South.

More broadly, EIA data shows that states that have been the quickest to add wind and solar generation to the grid have had lower power prices.

A majority of the 32 states with the fastest rising renewable resources voted for Trump and have Republican governors. The Administration’s policies will hurt those states.

And it’s not just renewables the Administration is hurting…

High natural gas prices and skyrocketing electricity demands from AI workloads are pushing operators toward this carbon-intensive option, according to a recent report from The Register. The publication highlights how utilities in regions like the Midwest and Appalachia are delaying coal plant retirements or even ramping up production to meet the surge, with data centers projected to consume up to 8% of U.S. electricity by 2030.

This shift comes amid broader industry pressures, where tech giants like Google and Microsoft are racing to expand their computing infrastructure. The irony is stark: companies pledging net-zero emissions are indirectly bolstering the dirtiest fossil fuel, as coal’s reliability trumps intermittent renewables in the short term.

The AI Boom’s Hidden Energy Cost

Analysts at Jefferies, as cited in The Register’s analysis, note that natural gas prices have spiked 50% in the past year due to export demands and supply constraints, making coal economically viable again. Data centers, which can require gigawatts of power equivalent to small cities, are negotiating direct deals with utilities to secure stable supplies, often at the expense of cleaner alternatives.

Environmental advocates warn this could undermine U.S. climate goals, with coal emissions potentially rising 10-15% in key states by 2026. Yet, for operators, the math is simple: AI training models demand constant, uninterruptible power that solar or wind can’t always guarantee without massive battery backups.

Utilities Adapt to Surging Demand

The Department of Energy’s latest report, referenced in related coverage, forecasts domestic data center energy use doubling by 2028, driven by generative AI. This has utilities like those in Virginia and Texas extending coal plant lifespans, with some facilities that were slated for shutdown now being retrofitted to serve hyperscale campuses.

Industry insiders point to specific examples, such as Rainbow Energy’s plans in North Dakota to power a 300MW data center directly from the state’s largest coal plant, as detailed in reports from Data Center Dynamics. Such colocation strategies minimize transmission losses but lock in fossil fuel dependence.

Balancing Innovation and Sustainability

Tech firms are not idle; investments in nuclear small modular reactors and geothermal energy are accelerating, but these solutions won’t scale until the 2030s. In the interim, coal fills the gap, with global data center electricity demand expected to double by 2026, per the International Energy Agency’s findings echoed in The Register.

Critics argue this is a short-sighted fix, potentially inflating energy costs and regulatory scrutiny. For instance, Duke Energy’s updated carbon plan gambles on coal for data center growth, citing Trump-era rollbacks on pollution rules, as reported by NC Newsline.

Looking Ahead: Policy and Tech Intersections

As the sector evolves, collaborations like Babcock & Wilcox’s agreements to convert coal plants to gas hybrids signal transitional paths, though full decarbonization remains elusive. The McKinsey report on AI’s power hunger underscores opportunities for investors in resilient infrastructure, but warns of grid strains without coordinated policy.

Ultimately, this coal resurgence tests the tech industry’s green commitments, forcing a reckoning between rapid innovation and environmental responsibility. With AI’s exponential growth showing no signs of slowing, stakeholders must navigate these tensions to forge a more sustainable path forward.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-fdfcf03b-da8a-4e45-8ce0-943dd4854932.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 15:01:31.797803

Kinew says every day the tariffs remain in place, the harm to Prairie producers deepens.
China charges a 76 per cent tariff on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100 per cent tariff on canola oil, meal and peas.
China also put a 25 per cent tariff on certain Canadian pork, fish and seafood products.
Ford did not mention the canola tariff in his letter to Carney.","Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew is asking the prime minister to scrap Canada's 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles in return for China lifting its tariffs on Canadian canola and pork.

Kinew says in a letter to Mark Carney on Saturday that while he believes protecting Canada's vehicle industry is important, he says the country's approach ""has created a two-front trade war that disproportionally affects Western Canada.""

The premier says in the letter that China's tariffs — widely seen as a response to Canada imposing the electric vehicle levy — have already caused a sharp drop in canola prices and that one vertically integrated pork producer in Manitoba is reporting a $19 million negative impact on an annual basis.

Canada imposed the electric vehicle duty last year in lockstep with the United States, which also has a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles, with Canada arguing the measure is meant to protect the country's automobile industry.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe has previously said he wanted Ottawa to do away with the electric vehicle tariff, but only if the country remained on good terms with the United States, and he has since said removing it would not be a simple fix.

Kinew says every day the tariffs remain in place, the harm to Prairie producers deepens.

""Canada's trade policy must balance long-term industrial goals and national security with immediate economic realities as well as the national responsibility to grow every region of Canada's economy ,"" Kinew said in his letter to Carney.

Kinew noted that the Chinese ambassador to Canada also recently said that China would be prepared to lift its tariffs on canola and pork in exchange for Canada removing the tax on Chinese electric vehicles.

CTV reported that Wang Di made the pledge through an interpreter during an interview for its program Question Period, which aired Sunday morning.

Kinew called it a ""critical moment"" and urged Carney's government to ""seize the opportunity.""

The ambassador said in an opinion piece posted on the embassy's website Thursday that the tariff on Chinese-made EVs contravenes World Trade Organization rules, and removing it ""will once again highlight the image that Canada has been trying to establish as an advocate for a rules-based international economic and trade order.""

China charges a 76 per cent tariff on Canadian canola seed imports and a 100 per cent tariff on canola oil, meal and peas. China also put a 25 per cent tariff on certain Canadian pork, fish and seafood products.

Ottawa has accused Beijing of unfairly subsidizing its electric vehicle industry and flooding international markets with cheap cars to gain a competitive advantage.

Ottawa said last month it was reviewing its decision to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, but is offering no clarity on when the review started or when it might conclude.

The tariffs took effect on Oct. 1, 2024.

At the time, the regulatory order introducing them stated the measure would be reviewed within one year of implementation.

Figures last week show Saskatchewan's canola exports to China have taken a nosedive, with data showing that Saskatchewan's exports to China fell to $96 million in August, a 76 per cent drop when compared with the same month last year.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a letter to Carney last month that Canada must maintain its 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles as Ottawa looks to secure a new trade deal with the U.S. and protect Canada's auto sector.

“This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.” WILMINGTON, Del.
In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.
“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said.
Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source.","“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Matt Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts.”

WILMINGTON, Del. (Oct. 6, 2025) — Energy policy took center stage early Monday as Dave Stevenson, director of the Caesar Rodney Institute’s Energy Policy Center, joined A Better Delaware Chair M. Jane Brady for the latest installment of a weekly public webcast, “A Better Discussion.” At the 8 a.m. session, Stevenson urged Delaware lawmakers to embrace small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and roll back state carbon-pricing mandates, which he says have driven up electricity costs and risked grid reliability heading into winter.

But while Stevenson and Brady see nuclear energy as part of Delaware’s long-term solution, Governor Matt Meyer and environmental advocates are taking a more cautious — or opposing — stance.

In announcing the creation of Delaware’s Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force in September, Meyer said the effort is about exploring all possible options to address rising costs.

“Delaware families and businesses are facing rising energy costs,” Meyer said. “We owe it to them to explore every possible solution to provide reliable, affordable, and clean energy.”

He added that nuclear deserves review, but not without scrutiny.

“Nuclear energy is one option that deserves careful study,” Meyer said. “This task force will bring together experts to evaluate the safety, cost, and environmental impacts before any decisions are made.”

Not all advocates agree the study is worthwhile. In its 2025 Legislative Recap, published in July, the Delaware Chapter of the Sierra Club reaffirmed its opposition to nuclear power as part of the state’s future energy mix.

The group instead urged lawmakers to:

Prioritize renewables such as solar and wind paired with battery storage;

Invest in energy efficiency and demand reduction, the most cost-effective strategies;

Avoid “costly, slow, and risky” nuclear projects that could leave waste and safety burdens; and

Focus on regional grid improvements and renewable integration rather than new nuclear feasibility studies.

The Sierra Club summarized its position by saying that while Governor Meyer believes nuclear “deserves careful study,” the organization sees it as “a distraction from cleaner, faster, and safer solutions.”

Stevenson’s Case for Nuclear

Stevenson said Delaware’s decarbonization mandates — not PJM’s market design — are “the root of reliability and cost problems.” He warned that “we could be looking at a blackout this winter” and claimed the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) adds “about 2 cents per kilowatt-hour for coal and 1 cent for natural gas,” making local generation uncompetitive.

He said Delaware now imports roughly 60 percent of its electricity.

Brady noted that the General Assembly’s new task force will consider small modular nuclear reactors as one potential future energy source. Stevenson said three units could supply Delaware’s entire power needs — “two at the Indian River site and one at Edgemoor.”

“These modern reactors are smaller, safer, and can operate with almost no evacuation zone beyond the plant fence line,” Stevenson said.

Cost, Jobs, and Timeline

Stevenson compared energy costs at about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour for natural gas, 8 cents and falling for nuclear, and 18 to 20 cents for offshore wind, noting that offshore wind “runs a little over a third of the time” and has a lifespan of about 20 years compared with 80 for nuclear.

He said federal tax incentives and grants could make Delaware an early mover.

“With acreage and transmission already at Indian River, you could colocate a data center and use the power on-site,” he said.

Citing University of Tennessee research on a similar project near Oak Ridge, Stevenson said Delaware could generate $3.5 billion in economic impact and 1,800 direct jobs by constructing three SMRs.

Recycling Nuclear Fuel

Stevenson also discussed advances in reprocessing, saying that 95 percent of spent nuclear fuel can now be recycled, turning a waste challenge into a potential $40 billion-per-year national industry.

He said draft federal legislation could allow states to bid for temporary storage and recycling facilities, potentially creating high-wage jobs tied to the next generation of nuclear technology.

Policy Path Forward

Both Brady and Stevenson agreed Delaware should avoid repeating past decisions to close plants before replacements were ready.

“If we act quickly, we could become a net exporter of energy,” Brady said. “Stable, low-cost power could attract businesses and data centers to Delaware.”

Stevenson added that combining SMRs with ending the state’s carbon tax “would restore reliability, lower rates, and position Delaware for growth.”

What Is a Small Modular Reactor?

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact nuclear plants built in factories and shipped for installation. Their design allows for passive safety systems, shorter build times, and smaller sites — often on the grounds of retired fossil-fuel plants that already have grid connections.",https://milfordlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/transmission-electric-lines.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 14:01:43.977820

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.
The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said.
The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.
After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.
“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Supporting displaced workers

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who’ve lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

Life as an oil worker

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he’s enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that’s set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://www.informnny.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2025/10/68eb94eabca6a2.18824617.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-12 14:02:07.914930

The Trump administration has been terrible for climate protection. We can stop some of what the administration is trying to do, and we can slow down some more. Our most powerful tool right now is suing the Trump administration. Federal judges decide “against Trump in about 95% of cases,” according to University of Chicago Law professor Aziz Huq.

The administration’s legal losses have created a wave of headlines: “Trump expresses frustration as judge temporarily blocks troop mobilization to Portland.” “Appeals court blocks Trump from removing Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve board.” “Judges appointed by Trump keep ruling against him”

You might worry the Supreme Court will reverse those Trump-administration losses. It happens, but the Supreme Court rules against the Trump administration about 20% of the time. You may have seen headlines like these: “Supreme Court Rejects, for Now, Trump’s Bid to Fire Government Watchdog.” “Amy Coney Barrett, John Roberts Deliver Trump Brutal Loss in NY Appeal.” “Divided Supreme Court rejects Trump bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid.”

Even when the Supreme Court does decide in Trump’s favor, along the way, the cases slow down the administration. The delays have led to their own wave of headlines: “Recent court rulings are holding up some of Trump’s highest-profile moves.” “Judges are pausing Trump’s policy changes.” “White House officials bristle as the courts throttle parts of Trump’s agenda.”

Legal suits against the Trump administration are now some of the most powerful tools we have, not just for climate protection, but also for protecting democracy. A bunch of websites now provide lists of who is suing the Trump administration and about what. A review of the suits shows some patterns:

Many of the suits are being brought by state attorneys general. Here in Washington state, Attorney General Nick Brown has led or been part of 40 suits suing the Trump administration. Some cities and counties have joined in, including San Diego; Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; King County; Multnomah County in Oregon, and Oakland County in California.

Many cases against the Trump administration have been brought by unions. If you work where you could be represented by a union, but you haven’t yet joined, now’s the time. This is not just to have representation when negotiating employment contracts. This is also to support our unions as they protect our democracy.

The other organizations that most need your support are nonprofits. Your support can buy more legal help, and the more legal help we have on our side, the better the outcomes.

Here are three nonprofits who deserve support for their defense of the climate: the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and EarthJustice.

Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)

The NRDC has been litigating to protect American natural resources for decades. NRDC reports they sued the first Trump Administration 163 times, winning 90% of their cases. This year, they are suing to:

Stop the Department of Energy from forcing aged gas and coal power plants to continue burning fossil fuels past the shutdown dates that were planned by engineers.

Protect fuel efficiency for gasoline vehicles.

Require the Trump administration comply with congressional budgeting for EV Charging stations (NRDC is partnering on this with the Sierra Club).

Sierra Club

In addition to advocating for our global climate and our environment, the Sierra Club organizes member hiking, biking, skiing, and birding outings. If you love getting into some of the wonderful parks in Washington State, you’ll appreciate meeting folks in the Sierra Club. Locally, the Sno-Isle Sierra Club is partnering with Kicking Gas to make heat pumps affordable for families who want to stop their global warming pollution. Nationally, the Sierra Club is suing the Trump Administration to get them to:

Live up to their legally required financing of new public electric vehicle charging stations

Rehire illegally fired employees for National Parks and National Forests.

Stop the ecological devastation of new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean.

EarthJustice

With their slogan, “Because the earth needs a good lawyer,” EarthJustice has been suing the government to protect the environment and protect our global climate for 60 years. This year, they are suing the Trump administration to:

Stop illegal defunding of clean energy projects.

Restore the IRA program to help Americans save money on vehicles and appliances that do not create global warming pollution.

Return climate information that farmers depend on to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website.

There are many other organizations that are suing the Trump administration. If I have missed one that you feel is doing particularly good work, let folks know about it in the comments.

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation is seeking bids for 500 million units of renewable energy annually to power its operations, aiming to increase clean energy reliance.

In a move aimed at increasing its reliance on clean energy, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has invited bids for the supply of 500 million units of renewable energy annually to power its operations, officials said on Sunday.

According to a statement, the DMRC is seeking to select a 'solar power developer' to set up a grid-connected captive generating plant along with a battery energy storage system (BESS) anywhere in India.

The energy produced will be supplied to the DMRC under a 25-year power purchase agreement, with the project expected to be completed within 15 months of award, it said.

At present, Delhi Metro meets about 33 per cent of its power demand from renewable sources. It procures around 350 MU annually from the Rewa Solar Park in Madhya Pradesh and generates 40 MU from rooftop solar installations across its stations, depots, and residential complexes, the statement said.

During daytime operations, the share of renewable energy reaches nearly 65 per cent, it added.

Live Events

With the new initiative, the DMRC said it aims to increase the share of renewable energy in its total power mix to over 60 per cent, including energy requirements for its upcoming Phase-IV network.

""If achieved, it will become the first Metro system in the country to source more than half of its total energy from clean sources,"" the statement said.

The move is part of DMRC's broader efforts to support India's transition to sustainable and low-carbon urban transport systems and comply with the government's 'Panchamrit' climate action goals announced at COP26.

The Public Utilities Commission last week directed its staff to consider proposals for new energy resources sought by Connecticut.

Any developments will have to be vetted by the commission for their benefits to Maine electric customers.

Connecticut put out a request for proposals last month seeking “late stage” projects that could capture federal tax breaks that may make them more cost-competitive for electric ratepayers.

James Fowler, spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said New England states share an electricity grid and working together on procurements potentially benefits regional ratepayers, enhanced grid reliability and affordability. Each state will perform its own evaluation and make its own decisions on whether to select projects, Fowler added.

“But by sharing information and pooling our demand, we hope to find opportunities to improve project viability and efficiency, such as by enabling purchases at larger scales, and capture the greatest benefits and value for ratepayers,” Fowler added.

In a statement, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources Dan Burgess said the state has often sought opportunities to coordinate with neighboring states on energy initiatives including energy procurement.

“By participating in Connecticut’s latest procurement effort, the state can consider its options to deliver more cost-effective clean power within federal tax credit timelines,” Burgess said.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtailed 30% of federal tax credits available to solar and wind developments. Projects now have to start construction by July 2026 or enter service by the end of 2027 and meet other requirements to qualify.

Maine launched its own expedited energy procurement this summer and last month selected five developments for contracts that could provide more than 250 megawatts of electricity.

The deadline for Connecticut’s procurement was Oct. 10.",https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/IMG_8021-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 14:01:54.688670

Over the last fifty years, energy companies have tapped into geothermal sources using machinery to access harder-to-reach reserves.
Geothermal energy contributes just 0.4 percent of the U.S. energy mix, largely due to technological and geographical constraints to accessing geothermal reservoirs.
The firm’s CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli, said, “Geothermal power is one of several renewable energy sources expanding globally and proving to be a vital contributor to advancing sustainable energy development.
Investments in innovative geothermal extraction technologies show great promise for the commercial rollout of new operations across the country.","One of the few renewable energy sources that the Trump administration has not yet criticised is geothermal power, as companies across the United States continue to develop innovative geothermal projects with financial support from Biden-era policies. The sweeping budget legislation that President Trump signed in July preserved most key tax credits for geothermal power. Bipartisan support has encouraged several energy companies and startups to invest heavily in research and development into advanced geothermal operations in recent years, with promising results, giving hope for future clean energy production.

People have been tapping into geothermal energy from natural heat sources worldwide for centuries. Over the last fifty years, energy companies have tapped into geothermal sources using machinery to access harder-to-reach reserves. To achieve this, companies drill a borehole up to several kilometres deep, where the rocks are around 200°C, and inject water and sand at high pressure. This creates fractures in the rocks, which increases their permeability and produces a reservoir of hot water that can be extracted via a second borehole for the water to be used to generate electricity.

Geothermal energy contributes just 0.4 percent of the U.S. energy mix, largely due to technological and geographical constraints to accessing geothermal reservoirs. Existing plants depend on naturally occurring reservoirs of hot water and steam, in regions such as Northern California and Nevada, to power turbines and generate power. However, companies are now exploring new ways to access geothermal resources using techniques developed for oil fracking and innovative new methods to reach harder-to-access reservoirs in unconventional regions.

Sage Geothermal is now using heat and pressure to generate more power than conventional extraction methods through its cycle-based heat recovery approach. The company’s CEO, Cindy Taff, told Forbes, “By using the natural elasticity of the rock, we can bring hot water to the surface without pumps. Unlike traditional approaches, we maintain pressure in the system rather than venting it at the surface, and we hold open fractures with pressure instead of adding bridging materials like sand or proppant. These innovations reduce friction and energy losses, boosting net power output by 25 to 50 percent compared to other next-generation geothermal technologies.”

In August, Sage announced it was partnering with the international geothermal energy developer Ormat Technologies to roll out its next-generation technology at an Ormat facility in either Nevada or Utah. This is expected to help Sage speed up the development of its first commercial power-generation facility by around two years. Taff said, “For us, the ability to scale faster with Ormat is huge… But it’s also a great opportunity for Ormat to reach a deeper [geothermal] resource than what they’re targeting now.”

In September, Sage signed an agreement with the geothermal startup Fervo Energy to advance their geothermal activities. The two companies have both invested heavily in research and development into alternative geothermal extraction methods and could work together to advance this work. Fervo recently signed a deal with tech giant Google to provide it with clean power, while Sage has completed an agreement with Meta.

Houston-headquartered Fervo Energy was approved to deploy 2 GW of geothermal power in Beaver County, Utah, by the Department of the Interior last year, with its facility set to begin generating power in 2026. The company uses an Enhanced Geothermal Systems (ESG) proprietary technology to drill horizontally into geothermal reservoirs, allowing it to access multiple wells from a single location and showing promise for greater unconventional geothermal energy generation.

In September, the energy technology company Baker Hughes was contracted by Fervo Energy to supply equipment for five of its power plants in the Cape Station project in Utah. The plants are expected to produce 300 MW of electricity once fully operational, enough to power about 180,000 homes. Baker Hughes will supply engineering and manufacturing equipment as well as turboexpanders and the BRUSH Power Generation generator.

The firm’s CEO, Lorenzo Simonelli, said, “Geothermal power is one of several renewable energy sources expanding globally and proving to be a vital contributor to advancing sustainable energy development. “By working with a leader like Fervo Energy and leveraging our comprehensive portfolio of technology solutions, we are supporting the scaling of lower-carbon power solutions that are integral to meet growing global energy demand.”

In September, Bill Gates visited Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project alongside Senator John Curtis. He described the company’s horizontal drilling method as a “truly innovative approach” and discussed the role companies like Fervo will play in maintaining America’s energy independence. The founder of tech giant Microsoft said, “Geothermal is one of the most promising ways to deliver clean energy that’s reliable and affordable.”

As the outlook for renewable energy in the United States becomes more uncertain, following the Trump administration's attacks on solar and wind power, the geothermal energy sector appears to have maintained the backing of the government as several companies continue to expand operations. Investments in innovative geothermal extraction technologies show great promise for the commercial rollout of new operations across the country.

In a statement, acting commissioner of the Maine Department of Energy Resources Dan Burgess said the state has often sought opportunities to coordinate with neighboring states on energy initiatives including energy procurement.

""By participating in Connecticut's latest procurement effort, the state can consider its options to deliver more cost-effective clean power within federal tax credit timelines,"" Burgess said.

President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act curtailed 30% of federal tax credits available to solar and wind developments. Projects now have to start construction by July 2026 or enter service by the end of 2027 and meet other requirements to qualify.

Maine launched its own expedited energy procurement this summer and last month selected five developments for contracts that could provide more than 250 megawatts of electricity.

This proposed facility was set to provide 6.2 gigawatts of clean energy from a vast area in the Nevada desert. However, it has disappeared from the Bureau of Land Management’s list of active projects, illustrating a shift away from renewable energy developments.

Esmeralda 7 Overview

Esmeralda 7 was intended to cover a land area comparable to Las Vegas. Once operational, it could have powered millions of homes while stabilizing energy costs for Nevada. The project was backed by industry giants such as NextEra, Invenergy, and Arevia, which were ready to invest billions of dollars.

Policy Changes and Their Implications

The cancellation resulted from changes made by the Interior Department under Secretary Doug Burgum. A new set of rules was introduced that complicates the approval process for renewable projects. As a result, large-scale developments like Esmeralda 7 face increased regulatory burdens, fragmented reviews, and heightened scrutiny.

Withdrawal of Programmatic Review: The review process that allowed for streamlined permits was rescinded.

Increased Barriers: New strategies limit acreage for solar developments and raise leasing costs.

Impact on Project Economics: Each subproject now requires separate environmental studies, undermining economic viability.

Consequences for Nevada

NV Energy forecasts a dramatic rise in electricity consumption due to data centers, expecting a 373% increase by 2030. Instead of relying on affordable clean energy from Esmeralda 7, the state will likely resort to gas-fired generation and higher electricity bills.

The Larger Context of Energy Production

While the U.S. turns away from large clean energy projects, countries like China and India are rapidly increasing their renewable capacities. This shift creates a competitive disadvantage for American industries that depend on affordable energy. The global emphasis is on reducing costs and promoting efficiency while the U.S. revisits outdated growth models.

International Success Models: Projects in Egypt, India, and Australia demonstrate the effectiveness of coordinated renewable development.

Cost Comparisons: Utility-scale solar averages $30 to $45 per MWh, making it highly competitive against fossil fuels.

The Future of Energy in America

The cancellation of Esmeralda 7 reflects a broader trend towards regulatory obstacles that threaten energy affordability. As the U.S. government complicates the deployment of renewable energy, the nation may find itself lagging in the global energy race. Investing in clean energy is not just an environmental imperative; it is also a crucial economic strategy.

In conclusion, the lack of initiative surrounding U.S. energy policies underscores the need for renewed commitment to clean, affordable energy projects.

But the 2026 Model 3 Standard may signal something simpler—and perhaps more consequential. It’s Tesla getting back to basics.

The new Model 3 isn’t flashy. It doesn’t tout record-breaking speed or breakthrough battery chemistry. Instead, it refines what already worked: a sedan that looks sleek, drives clean, and now, quietly undercuts much of the electric competition on price. With modest design updates, an improved ride, and an estimated range north of 320 miles (514.99 km), this version appears built less to dazzle than to dominate.

Tesla has trimmed weight, streamlined components, and recalibrated its pricing in an electric vehicle market that’s cooling from the highs of 2021. According to data from Cox Automotive, EV inventory in the U.S. reached an all-time high this summer, while average EV prices dropped nearly 20% from a year prior. In that landscape, the Model 3 Standard’s quiet arrival feels almost subversive.

There’s no viral unveiling or theatrical reveal. Just a tighter build, a quieter cabin, and fewer dollars on the sticker. It may not be the most exciting Tesla release—but it could be the most important one in years.

Design Language Grows Up, Subtly

The visual changes are subtle enough to miss at a glance, but side by side with the outgoing model, the new Model 3 is unmistakably sharper. Headlights are narrower. The front fascia is cleaner. The hoodline, marginally lowered, adds a more assertive stance. Tesla claims improved aerodynamics, and while the drag coefficient is only slightly reduced, the cumulative effect is noticeable in real-world driving—less wind noise, better efficiency.

Inside, the theme is restraint. Physical buttons are gone entirely, replaced by capacitive controls and voice activation. A single touchscreen remains the command center for everything from navigation to climate. While some drivers may miss tactile inputs, Tesla’s user interface has matured significantly, and software updates have made features like lane keeping and adaptive cruise smoother and more intuitive than earlier iterations.

The result isn’t a revolution. It’s refinement. This is a car that feels familiar—but finished.

Performance That Prioritizes Polish Over Power

In a lineup known for zero-to-sixty bravado, the Standard’s single-motor, rear-wheel-drive configuration is refreshingly grounded. Acceleration is brisk but not blistering—Tesla hasn’t released final specs, but independent testing from AutoGuide pegs the sprint to 60 mph (96.56 km/h) around 5.8 seconds, squarely in the range of a BMW 3 Series or Audi A4.

What stands out more is the chassis. The new Model 3 rides smoother than before, with revised suspension tuning that soaks up road imperfections without feeling detached. Steering remains light but responsive, and regenerative braking has been refined for more predictable pedal feel.

Tesla has also expanded driver control over performance settings. Drivers can now tweak regenerative braking intensity, cooling modes, and even traction bias, giving more customization than previous Standard trims. These are small additions, but they signal Tesla’s intent to treat even its base models with engineering care.

Range Estimates That Meet Real-World Expectations

Tesla claims an EPA-estimated range of 321 miles, placing the Standard version well above the median for similarly priced EVs. Unlike many competitors, Tesla’s range estimates tend to hold up under real-world driving conditions—a result of optimized software, efficient motors, and aerodynamic design.

Battery size remains slightly below that of the Long Range or Performance models, but advances in energy density and drivetrain management help close the gap. The company has also improved thermal management systems to maintain range stability across climates—a common pain point for EV drivers in colder regions from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Charging remains a strong suit. Tesla’s Supercharger network, now opening to non-Tesla vehicles in several states, still offers the fastest and most widespread fast-charging experience in North America. The Model 3 Standard supports up to 170 kW DC fast charging, allowing an 80% top-up in just over 25 minutes under optimal conditions.

The Affordability Pivot Is No Accident

The most attention-grabbing change is the one on the invoice. The 2026 Model 3 Standard now starts below $38,000 before federal incentives, making it eligible for up to $7,500 in EV tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act—assuming final battery sourcing meets eligibility rules source. That could bring the effective price below $31,000, rivaling many gas-powered sedans.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Model-3-Standard-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:01:25.058642

The company has begun telling tired drivers to switch on its Full Self-Driving system. Safety researchers say this move might backfire and have severe consequences, Wired reported.

What's happening?

Tesla's dashboard prompts drivers to consider activating FSD, the brand's most advanced driver-assist package, if they feel drowsy. However, the feature is still considered experimental and requires constant human oversight.

That's where the concern comes in. For so long, the feature held a disclaimer that the driver must be able to take control at any given time. With the new in-car messaging in place, researchers worry that it could confuse tired drivers when they need to be focused on the road.

""The prompt seems highly contrary to research,"" Bryan Reimer, a driver assistance technology research scientist at MIT's AgeLab, pointed out to Wired.

Why is this important?

""As humans, as we get tired or we get fatigued, taking away more things that we need to do could actually backfire,"" Charlie Klauer, a driver and driving performance researcher at Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, explained to Wired. He noted that implementing such a system could be tricky.

According to the National Sleep Foundation, 20% of driving accidents in 2023 were caused by drowsy driving. Suggesting tired drivers hand over more control could increase risks instead of reducing them.

The environmental angle also matters. Electric vehicles are supposed to help reduce heat-trapping pollution and save money on transportation. If drivers and regulators lose trust in EVs because of safety controversies, adoption could slow down.

Critics also argue that the alert could mislead users into believing FSD is closer to full autonomy than it really is.

Tesla has previously faced scrutiny for allegedly overstating its software's abilities, and its other features — like the force-touch turn signals in Model 3 and Model S vehicles — have sparked controversy in driving schools. Safety advocates worry this move undermines the company's claims of prioritizing driver responsibility.

What's being done about it?

Advocates are calling for clearer rules on semi-autonomous features, as highlighted in the Indiana Law Journal, and for tighter regulations, according to research published in Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives.

Altschuler, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5549528-tariffs-hurt-us-economy/,"“I love tariffs,” President Trump has said.
… And when we finish this out, there’ll never be any wealth like what we have.” The United States has “already solved inflation, we’ve solved prices,” Trump maintains as well.
At 17.4 percent, the Trump tariff rate is at its highest since 1935.
To evade tariffs, China has moved some manufacturing and assembly operations to other countries.
China is courting leaders around the world who have been stung by the Trump tariffs.","“I love tariffs,” President Trump has said. “My favorite word is ‘tariff.’”

Thanks to the tariffs he has imposed on about 90 countries, he claims, “we’re becoming rich as hell. … And when we finish this out, there’ll never be any wealth like what we have.” The United States has “already solved inflation, we’ve solved prices,” Trump maintains as well.

A substantial majority of Americans do not agree.

In a poll taken in August by the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of respondents did not approve of Trump’s tariff policies. And 55 percent indicated the levies will have a negative impact on them, their families and the country.

Americans have good reason to be concerned. Far from becoming “rich as hell,” the federal government is in a deep financial hole. This year, spending increased by $391 billion; the $1.9 trillion deficit is the third largest in U.S. history. The total national debt tops $37 trillion, a number which, following passage of the administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” is virtually certain to increase by trillions. Tariff revenues have not and cannot make more than a small dent in these deficits.

At 17.4 percent, the Trump tariff rate is at its highest since 1935. Tariffs are the principal reason inflation is higher now than it was when Trump began his second term in January. This year, tariffs will, on average, cost each household about $2,300. Price increases include a 10 percent levy on wood and lumber and 25 percent on kitchen cabinets, upholstered furniture and bathroom vanities, set to go into effect on Oct. 14. The added costs are likely to slow the construction of affordable residential housing, which is already out of reach for many buyers and renters.

The tariffs have upended supply chains. Apple has moved iPhone assembly plants from China to India. Stellantis N.V. paused production in North America because of price hikes in automotive components. To evade tariffs, China has moved some manufacturing and assembly operations to other countries.

Applied to friends as well as foes, at times without a discernible justification or, as with Brazil, out of personal or partisan animus, the tariffs have antagonized Canadians, Mexicans, Japanese, Australians and members of the European Union. China is courting leaders around the world who have been stung by the Trump tariffs.

Ironically, the tariff war has also undermined the domestic manufacturing and agrarian sectors of the economy Trump promised to protect and promote.

China’s zeroing out of its multibillion-dollar purchases of American soybeans, the largest agricultural product exported by the United States, caused prices to plummet to $9 per bushel. John Deere & Company attributes much of its projected 26 percent drop in net income to reduced spending by farmers on machinery and price increases in aluminum and steel. Trucking companies have suffered as well from the decline in agricultural exports.

“Farmers … are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit,” Trump has declared. And so, the administration, which distributed $23 billion to them during the trade wars in his first term, is now preparing a bailout in the neighborhood of $35-50 billion.

Already reeling from higher prices for fertilizers and equipment and the potentially permanent loss of markets, farmers are apoplectic about reports that the administration is working out details of a $20 billion aid package to Argentina, which comes on the heels of that country’s replacement of the United States as the major supplier of soybeans to China. Scarcely part of an America First agenda, what Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent calls a “credit swap line,” appears to be a lifeline to Argentina’s embattled libertarian president, Javier Milei, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.

The CEOs of General Motors, Ford and Stellantis NV recently projected that tariffs will cost their companies $4.5 billion, $2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in revenues, and that production levels would not rebound until 2027. In an apparent attempt to placate them and prevent potential buyers of cars and trucks from sticker shock, the Trump administration is reportedly close to a deal that would spare vehicles assembled in the U.S. from tariffs.

This move was an about-face by a president who imposed an import tax on Mexican vehicles in July 2025 that exceeded the rate on all other countries except China, undermining the USMCA treaty he had signed with Mexico and Canada in 2020 and praised as “the largest fairest, most balanced and modern trade agreement ever achieved.”

Whether Trump has the authority to, in essence, take over tariff policy is in dispute. The Constitution grants Congress the power to impose tariffs. Legislation in the 20th century allowed the president to levy tariffs to address threats to national security and unfair trade practices, but the Supreme Court has indicated that this delegation of powers must include “intelligible principles” that limit the president’s actions.

The Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on tariffs in the coming months. Whatever the high court decides, however, it should be clear that using tariffs as a blunt instrument of global domination actually does substantial damage to America’s international reputation, national interests and economy, as well as to its manufacturers, retailers and consumers.

(AP) — Thirty years ago, Willie Cruz was shocked when he learned the Southern California oil refinery where he worked was shutting down.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he's advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California's leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state's climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry's workers unsure of what the future holds.

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,"" Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

One study estimated that the state would lose nearly 58,000 workers in the oil and gas industries between 2021 and 2030. About 56% of those workers will have to find new jobs because they are not retiring, according to the 2021 report by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Lawmakers approved the Displaced Oil and Gas Worker Fund in 2022 to help workers receive career training and connect with job opportunities. The state has since awarded nearly $30 million overall to several groups to help workers across the state — from oil-rich Kern County to Contra Costa County in the Bay Area.

But the funding is set to run out in 2027, and state lawmakers wrapped up their work for the year without an agreement on whether to extend it.

Newsom spokesperson Daniel Villaseñor said the governor is committed to supporting displaced oil workers “and affected communities in transitioning into new and emerging jobs and economic opportunities.”

Newsom approved $20 million in the state’s 2022-2023 budget for a pilot program to train workers in the industry who've lost their jobs to plug abandoned oil wells in Kern and Los Angeles counties.

California needs a clear plan for workers who will lose jobs because of the state’s energy transition, said Faraz Rizvi, the policy and campaign manager at the Asian Pacific Environmental Network.

“We’re in solidarity with workers who have been displaced and who are looking for a relief to ensure that they’re able to find work that is important for their communities,” Rizvi said.

But Jodie Muller, president and CEO of the Western States Petroleum Association, said the state can protect jobs by changing its climate policies.

“The extremists fighting to close California refineries should explain why they are OK with destroying some of the best blue-collar jobs out there — because we certainly are not,” she said in a statement.

For many workers, the industry offers an opportunity to earn a living wage without a college degree.

Wilfredo Cruz was attracted in part by the paycheck. After more than a decade, he makes a base salary of $118,000 a year as a pipe fitter at the Phillips 66 refinery.

But there are downsides.

Every day when Cruz gets home from work, he showers immediately to try to shield his son from exposure to any harmful chemicals. He also never lets the 2-year-old ride in the car he takes to work.

Now he's enrolled in an online cybersecurity training course, schooling paid for by the state program that's set to expire in the next couple of years.

“There’s not really a real clear plan to be able to get workers from this oil industry into these new fields,” he said. “So, you feel kind of forgotten.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a477104a-9966-40c9-b597-1af6563b709f/wirestory_a5c28123e10a0090896e59abf69c152c_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-12 08:59:42.937158

Researchers have now developed a cocatalyst that introduces single-atom copper sites into tungsten nitride, creating highly active centers that favor hydrogen generation over unwanted byproducts. When combined with a cadmium sulfide photocatalyst, the new system achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 172.69 μmol·h⁻¹ with selectivity approaching 95%. Detailed experimental and theoretical analyses revealed that copper single atoms enhance charge transfer, open electron pathways, and provide novel active sites for hydrogen evolution. This discovery demonstrates a powerful strategy for designing efficient and selective photocatalytic systems for renewable hydrogen production.

Hydrogen is considered a clean fuel for the future, but conventional production methods remain energy-intensive and carbon-emitting. Photoreforming of formic acid, a common biomass derivative and hydrogen carrier, provides a mild and renewable pathway for hydrogen generation. However, traditional semiconductor catalysts such as CdS suffer from low activity and poor selectivity due to competing side reactions, including carbon monoxide formation, which reduce hydrogen purity. Transition-metal nitrides have recently emerged as cocatalysts with improved performance, yet selectivity limitations persist. Based on these challenges, there is a critical need to develop advanced catalysts with engineered active sites to enhance both efficiency and selectivity in hydrogen photoreforming systems.

A research team from Xi’an Jiaotong University, University of South China, and collaborating institutes reported a development (DOI: 10.1002/cey2.70024) in Carbon Energy on June 4, 2025. The study presents a Cu–W₂N₃ cocatalyst containing atomically dispersed copper sites, which, when integrated with CdS, markedly enhances hydrogen production from the photoreforming of formic acid. The new system achieved higher activity and nearly 95% hydrogen selectivity, outperforming conventional cocatalysts. This work sheds light on how tailoring single-atom sites on cocatalyst surfaces can effectively direct reaction pathways toward clean hydrogen generation.

The team synthesized two-dimensional Cu–W₂N₃ nanosheets using a modified molten salt method, ensuring the copper species were atomically dispersed rather than aggregated into nanoparticles. Advanced microscopy and spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Cu single-atom sites with a +1 oxidation state embedded in the W₂N₃ lattice. These sites altered the electronic structure, creating Cu–N–W electron channels that facilitated rapid charge transfer from CdS to the cocatalyst. Performance tests showed that the CdS/Cu–W₂N₃ hybrid achieved a hydrogen generation rate of 172.69 μmol·h⁻¹ with selectivity up to 93.7–95%, significantly higher than bare CdS (45%) or CdS/W₂N₃ (83%). The system also demonstrated excellent stability across ten continuous cycles. Mechanistic studies revealed that copper single atoms suppress carbon monoxide evolution by reducing nitrogen vacancy sites while simultaneously providing efficient new active centers for hydrogen evolution. Density functional theory calculations further supported that Cu single atoms on the {001} facet are energetically favorable for hydrogen formation. Together, these findings confirm that rational design of single-atom cocatalysts is a powerful strategy to simultaneously achieve high activity and selectivity in solar-driven hydrogen production.

“Our study shows that introducing single-atom copper sites into tungsten nitride fundamentally changes the selectivity of photocatalytic reactions,” said Prof. Xiangjiu Guan, corresponding author. “These atomically dispersed sites not only accelerate electron transfer but also suppress competing pathways that produce carbon monoxide. This dual function allows us to obtain hydrogen with very high purity under sunlight. The work highlights how careful engineering of cocatalyst surfaces at the atomic level can unlock new opportunities for efficient, sustainable hydrogen production from renewable resources.”

The development of Cu–W₂N₃ single-atom cocatalysts opens a new pathway toward practical solar-driven hydrogen production. By ensuring high selectivity and stability, the system addresses two major barriers to scaling photocatalytic hydrogen technologies. Beyond formic acid, the design principles could be applied to other biomass-derived fuels and liquid hydrogen carriers, offering a sustainable route for coupling carbon-neutral energy conversion with biomass utilization. The study also advances the broader field of single-atom catalysis, showing how atomic precision can control reaction outcomes. Ultimately, this approach paves the way for producing high-purity hydrogen as a clean fuel for transportation, storage, and chemical industries.

Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.

Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he’s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.

“I thought it was pretty cool, you know — go from polluting to helping, right?” Cruz said.

Now he’s advising his son, Wilfredo Cruz, as the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles where the 37-year-old has worked for 12 years plans to close by the end of the month.

Thousands — perhaps tens of thousands — of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.

California’s leading Democrats are grappling with how to confront lost jobs and high gas prices that the oil industry says are the result of the state’s climate policies.

State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was “taking on big oil.”

That inconsistent messaging has left the industry’s workers unsure of what the future holds.

Refinery closures

California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California’s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.

The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and “in response to market dynamics,” Phillips 66 said.

The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.

Phillips 66 said it is “committed to treating all our refinery workers fairly and respectfully throughout this process.”

Valero announced plans to “idle, restructure or cease refining operations” at its refinery in the Bay Area city of Benicia by the end of April. The company didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on the status of its plans.

Valero pays about $7.7 million annually in taxes to the city, making up around 13% of Benicia’s revenues, City Manager Mario Giuliani said.

“It’s a significant and seismic impact to the city,” he said of the planned closure.

Forty-six oil refineries in California closed between 2018 and 2024, according to the state’s Employment Development Department. The fossil fuel industry employs roughly 94,000 people in the state, according to the Public Policy Institute of California.

Unlike traditional site-built reactors, these reactors can be made in a factory.

NuScale is at the leading edge of a big change in nuclear power.

The ""big"" problem with nuclear power

Historically, nuclear power plants have been huge capital investment projects. Nuclear reactors have, so far, been site built, meaning that all of the construction basically takes place where the reactor is going to be located. The projects have also been massive, with nuclear power plants often meant to replace large coal or natural gas power plants.

It isn't uncommon for nuclear reactor projects to be delayed and over budget. For example, the most recent nuclear power plant built in the United States, by regulated utility The Southern Company, was seven years late and cost around $17 billion more than expected. Those are not good construction results, even though Southern will now have access to reliable nuclear power for decades into the future.

Given that backdrop, it is understandable that another company building the same style of nuclear power plant at roughly the same time simply gave up when its project manager, Westinghouse, went bankrupt. Southern, by contrast, took on the role of project manager from Westinghouse, which was also overseeing its reactors, so it could keep its power plant construction going.

Needless to say, the nuclear power industry isn't an easy industry in which to operate. And when things go wrong at a large, site-built nuclear power plant, they can go wrong in a massive way, noting the two meltdowns and one near miss highlighted above. That usually earns the entire industry a black eye despite a generally safe operating history for most nuclear power plants.

NuScale is changing the script by going ""small""

This is where NuScale Power comes in, given that it is building small scale modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). These reactors are built in a factory, creating a more uniform product that also benefits from the cost efficiencies offered by an assembly line manufacturing approach.

They are small, so they can be easily transported to where they are needed, located more closely to population centers, and adverse events are expected to be easier to contain. In addition, by including the most modern technology, the safety of NuScale's SMRs is expected to be higher than for older reactors.

To be fair, NuScale isn't the only company working on SMR technology. However, it was ""the first SMR to receive U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) design approval."" It is currently the only SMR approved by the NRC, which the company believes gives it a bit of a leg up on the competition. But there's another important piece to the puzzle.

NuScale Power is working with RoPower, a Romanian electricity company, as it makes its final go/no go decision on a new nuclear power plant. That plant could end up being powered by six SMRs provided by NuScale Power that will be linked together. NuScale has already ordered parts that have long construction times for the six SMRs this project would require. But it has those same parts on order for another six reactors as well. In other words, the company is ready to hit the ground running.

The company's stock has risen around 200% or so over the past year. Wall Street clearly isn't ignoring the stock. However, with a final decision from RoPower expected sometime in the next year, NuScale Power could quickly change from a good idea to a real business. Notably, the second SMR sale should be much easier to get than the first, since the ice will have been broken. So NuScale Power could turn into a growth story very quickly.

Watch NuScale, even if you don't buy it

Nuclear power and SMRs aren't things that people talk about every day. But SMRs are a potential game-changing technology in the energy sector, with NuScale Power one of the companies leading the way into the future.

If that is interesting to you, and you are a more aggressive investor, you might want to consider buying before the first sale is inked. But even if you aren't interested in buying NuScale, it's worth learning about the huge energy opportunity that SMRs offer the world.

The collaboration aims to support growth for American solar manufacturing and create domestic job opportunities.

T1 Energy’s latest move clearly struck a chord with investors, as the stock’s 7-day share price return surged over 43%. This built on massive momentum with a 94.7% climb in the last month. Momentum really took off this year, with the 1-year total shareholder return topping 250%, even as longer-term returns are still catching up from past declines.

If you find these shifts in the renewables space compelling, it’s a great moment to broaden your search and discover

But with shares riding a powerful wave of optimism, the key question for investors now is whether T1 Energy is still trading at a bargain or if the market has already factored in all its future potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 21% Overvalued

Despite ambitious expectations for rapid business expansion and strong tailwinds, the current market price of $3.64 sits noticeably above the $3.00 fair value suggested by the most widely tracked narrative. Here is the core fundamental argument behind that valuation outlook.

The expansion of U.S. electricity demand, driven by the AI infrastructure build-out, electrification of transportation, and onshoring of advanced manufacturing, positions T1 as a key provider of solar modules and storage solutions for a rapidly growing market, supporting sustained topline revenue growth. Robust government policy tailwinds, including stackable, transferable Section 45X tax credits and protectionist trade measures, are providing T1 with access to funding, margin-boosting incentives, and risk mitigation for its U.S. production pipeline. This should improve both earnings quality and net margins.

Earnings power, revenue takeoff, and government incentives all build a case for T1’s future valuation leap. Analysts are betting on exceptional growth prospects and big margin improvements, but only the full narrative breaks down the bold assumptions fueling this premium price tag.

Result: Fair Value of $3.00 (OVERVALUED)

However, if government incentives weaken or T1 Energy fails to secure project financing, the company’s impressive growth outlook could encounter significant short-term hurdles.

Another View: Market Ratios Send a Mixed Signal

Looking at the price-to-sales ratio, T1 Energy appears reasonably valued against its peers. It trades at 3x sales, well below the average peer multiple of 15.4x and the fair ratio of 36.7x. However, compared to the US Electrical industry’s average of 2.3x, it appears slightly more expensive. Does this gap mean hidden risks, or could the market re-rate the stock closer to those higher multiples?

With Alliance Resource Partners now trading at a noticeable discount to analyst price targets and showing solid long-term returns, the key question is whether shares are undervalued or if the market is already factoring in the company’s future growth potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 17.9% Undervalued

With the narrative’s fair value set at $30.5, Alliance Resource Partners’ last close at $25.05 represents a significant gap that could catch opportunistic investors’ attention. This pricing difference is rooted in expectations for sector tailwinds and future profit expansion, setting the stage for a closer look at the underlying trends.

Recent legislative and administrative shifts in U.S. energy policy, such as regulatory reprieves for coal plants, the phasing out of renewable tax credits in favor of baseload power, and direct financial incentives to keep fossil fuel plants operational, have created the most favorable regulatory environment for coal in decades. These tailwinds should support stable or potentially higher future coal sales volumes and improve longer-term revenue visibility for Alliance Resource Partners.

What’s fueling the optimism behind this price target? The answer could rest on a unique blend of future profit forecasts and margin resilience rarely seen in today’s energy market. Unpack the narrative's bold projection and see if the numbers add up to the premium analysts are betting on.

Today, that means reducing our reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy components.
Clean energy dominance isn’t just about climate.","For decades, American energy dominance was measured in oil barrels and gas pipelines. But in a world powered by artificial intelligence and digital infrastructure, true energy leadership is about more than fuel — it’s about building and owning the systems that power tomorrow’s economy.

Energy remains the backbone of economic and national strength. But how we use and produce it is changing rapidly. AI and cloud computing are driving massive new electricity demand. Data centers alone could more than double their energy use worldwide by 2030. In the U.S., they are projected to account for nearly half of all new electricity demand — alongside growth in electric vehicles, robotics and electrified industry.

Meeting this surge is a strategic challenge. The nation that builds the infrastructure for the AI-powered economy will lead the global one.

To meet rising demand, America needs a diverse, secure energy mix — from fossil fuels to solar, wind, advanced nuclear, hydrogen and storage. This isn’t ideology. It’s national interest.

Clean energy is:

Homegrown: Sun, wind and geothermal heat can’t be imported from adversaries.

Resilient: When paired with smart grids and batteries, clean energy boosts grid security.

Economically smart: Renewables are cost-competitive and create millions of American jobs.

Exportable: The U.S. can lead by exporting next-generation energy tech and infrastructure.

We shouldn’t just adapt to the energy transition — we should lead it.

Energy independence has long been a bipartisan goal. Today, that means reducing our reliance on foreign-controlled clean energy components. Right now, China controls more than 70% of global production capacity for solar panels, batteries and the minerals needed to build them.

That’s a strategic vulnerability. To secure our future, we must:

Re-shore manufacturing of clean tech.

Strengthen domestic mining and refining.

Build alliances to diversify global supply chains.

None of this works without a modern grid. That means:

Building cyber-resilient, high-capacity transmission.

Speeding up permitting while protecting safety and property.

Supporting U.S. innovation across energy technologies.

Clean energy dominance isn’t just about climate. It’s also about jobs, security and sovereignty. By investing in innovation, infrastructure and independence, America can lead the intelligent age — just as it led the industrial one.

340B a profit machine

Living with multiple chronic conditions means I know health care costs intimately. Every month, I weigh medication expenses against other living expenses — and sometimes the math forces me to delay or skip doses I need. Across Illinois and nationwide, countless patients face this same brutal calculus.

Despite understanding our health care system well, I was stunned to discover how a program designed to help vulnerable patients has become a profit machine for big hospitals and pharmacies.

Perhaps most people haven’t heard of the 340B prescription drug benefit, created in 1992 to help safety-net clinics serve low-income patients. Today, hundreds of big hospital systems have taken full advantage of this program. Instead of passing drug discounts to struggling patients, many hospitals pocket the difference as pure profit. Patients like me remain oblivious that our lifesaving medications generate millions for these institutions.

The betrayal deepens: Our state legislature wants to systemize the worst abuses through a law that would further enrich for-profit pharmacies at patients’ expense. While 340B desperately needs reform, those changes must come from Congress — and they must put patients first, not hospital profit margins.

The program meant to be our safety net has become their cash cow. It’s time to reclaim it.

— Karen Brown, Chicago

Transparency in 340B

Manufacturers make the world a better place to live, and there’s no clearer example of the impact they have on our daily lives than the wide array of safe and effective pharmaceuticals available to prevent, treat and manage medical conditions.

The production of reliable, quality medication is vital to public health, and manufacturers don’t take this responsibility lightly. That’s why biopharmaceutical manufacturers are committed to improving access to medicines in underserved communities, ensuring low-income and vulnerable populations can receive discounted drugs.

Initially, that was the promise of the 340B drug pricing program, which was designed to provide discounted medications to eligible health care providers serving low-income and vulnerable patients. Unfortunately, the program is increasingly being used by large, affluent health systems with little assurance savings are reaching the intended patients.

Consider the numbers: Only 21% of 340B pharmacy locations in Illinois are in low-income neighborhoods, and nearly 60% of participating hospitals provide less charity care than the national average. Unfortunately, legislation under consideration in Springfield would do little to address this. Instead, it would provide substantial protection for covered entities while obscuring the disclosure of their financial arrangements, making it impossible to see how much benefit is diverted from patients to these intermediaries.

If lawmakers want to lower health care costs, we need real transparency and accountability in 340B. Let’s work together to ensure low-income patients benefit from reduced drug prices, not the bottom lines of large hospital systems.

— Mark Denzler, president and CEO, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, Springfield

A fair map in Illinois

Kudos to the Tribune Editorial Board (“We strongly support this bipartisan plan to fix Illinois’ broken state elections,” Oct. 5) for its editorial support for fixing the broken state election system in Illinois with a fairer redistricting plan that would let voters pick their representatives going forward rather than the other way around!

The U.S. Constitution purports to guarantee each state a republican (with a small “r”) form of government, but that is not what a state has when districts are cynically drawn up to ensure one-party control, as is currently the case in Illinois.

It is therefore good to see a bipartisan effort led by prominent Democrat Bill Daley and Republican Ray LaHood to get a referendum on the ballot in November 2026 for an Illinois constitutional amendment to permit this and that Fair Maps Illinois has a specific plan to recommend, should the amendment pass.

That other states may also currently engage in partisan redistricting is no excuse for Illinoisans not to clean up our act, and — frankly — it rings hollow to hear Illinois politicians complain about other states when our own state has such unclean hands.

I thank the editorial board for its support of the Daley-LaHood proposal, and I urge all Illinois voters to sign the petition to help restore government of the people, by the people and for the people to the Land of Lincoln.

— David L. Applegate, Huntley

We can’t yield ground

Although the editorial proposal to make Illinois “fairer” in its elections is interesting, I believe the Tribune Editorial Board misses the point.

Republicans under President Donald Trump are busy gerrymandering Democrats out of existence in states such as Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. Illinois under Democratic leadership remains one of the few states in the country to stand up for humane, progressive values; immigrants; and minority rights.

Until both sides play fair, I believe Illinois cannot yield to Republican pressure to add seats, and this will never happen as long as Trump rules. I am proud to live in Illinois where the common citizen still has some rights over the rich and powerful. We can’t afford to yield any ground now.

— Ken Kramer, Glen Ellyn

Disagreement in church

The Rev. Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic priest, writes in an op-ed on Oct. 6 about the inconsistency between Catholic Church teaching and the practice of the same by some (“Public fight among Illinois bishops hurting church, nation”). He mentions the American Catholic Church several times being in disagreement with itself and briefly compares it with “African traditions” being “sacred spaces of decision.”

He correctly implies that Catholic Church doctrine is universal, i.e., global, but he minimizes the reality that the church exists in a world where nations play a major role in how Catholic teaching is practiced. The church views itself as being “in the world but not part of it.”

The role of the church is aimed at what is best for humans as taught by Christ, i.e., “full spectrum of human dignity and the common good.” In the secular world of nations, the same ideals for the most part are also sought. But a nation, in order to continue to be a nation, must first do what is necessary to preserve its nationhood, and that sometimes impinges on Catholic teaching, even causing disagreement within a nation’s Catholics.

Disagreement is part of the human experience, however, and hopefully brings about a positive result.

In other words, Louisiana is obviously water rich, but we have no idea exactly how rich we are.
It may be, at some point in the future, that selling Toledo Bend water is an idea that makes sense from a financial and resource-management perspective.","It's not often that Louisiana balks at an offer to sell its natural resources for cash.

That's why it's a pleasant surprise to see two state legislators warn the Sabine River Authority that any attempt to sell water from the Toledo Bend Reservoir is a nonstarter. It's even better that the two legislators, Rep. Brett Geymann, R-Lake Charles, and Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, chair committees that would need to bless any such sale.

For those who have not spent time on the bucolic, 186,000-acre, 65-mile-long reservoir located on Louisiana's western border, let me explain. Toledo Bend was created when the Sabine River was dammed in the 1960s. It's become extremely popular as a recreation and fishing spot for thousands from both Louisiana and Texas.

It's governed jointly by Louisiana and Texas, through two different authorities, one on each side of the border. Water that flows through the dam on the reservoir's southern end is used to generate hydroelectric power; each side has the authority to sell some of the water, though the proceeds must be split.

But for several years, there have been discussions about selling a portion of Louisiana's share of the water to a company called Aqueduct Partners, which would pipe it to water-starved cities in Texas. Proponents argue that this sale could be done with little to no impact on lake levels and generate far more revenue than hydroelectric generation.

But the idea has drawn opposition from many locals, who argue that such a sale could cause water levels to drop and make the reservoir less amenable to recreation.

Earlier this week, Geymann and Hensgens sent a letter to Louisiana's Sabine River Authority, urging them to reject any proposed sale.

""We urge you to abandon these plans and safeguard the long-term interests of our people, economy and environment,"" Geymann and Hensgens wrote. ""Toledo Bend is vital to Louisiana residents, businesses and wildlife.""

They are right about that. But more important is something Hensgens told this newspaper's David Mitchell.

""I just believe that in the next century, water is going to be the most important natural resource we've got, and it is Louisiana's water. It belongs to the state taxpayers, and I just don't believe we should be selling it,"" Hensgens said.

Hensgens is absolutely right about this. Water is an increasingly valuable natural resource. Fortunately for Louisiana, the state is blessed with plenty of it both on the surface and under it. But there is little statewide impetus to take an accounting of just how much, despite increasing demands from industry, agriculture and, potentially, more data centers, which use a lot of water.

In other words, Louisiana is obviously water rich, but we have no idea exactly how rich we are. And until we know how much we have, we shouldn't be selling what we do have, no matter how tempting the dollar signs dangled by rich Texans.

Thankfully, Geymann and Hensgens' letter seems to indicate, at least for now, that no such deal will go forward.

It may be, at some point in the future, that selling Toledo Bend water is an idea that makes sense from a financial and resource-management perspective.

But that time has not yet come.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c4/6c4c578a-0ecc-54f8-8811-d036888c7de2/68d76ab30c7b2.image.jpg?crop=1602%2C841%2C29%2C2&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-12 13:07:13.446273

Across the country, more and more farmers have embraced solar power to make their farms run cleaner and protect the land they depend on while saving on utility costs.

Living and working in rural areas demands you to be self-sufficient. One of the best ways to ensure that people in rural areas have power – no matter how far they live from the nearest utility connection – is through solar power. By producing their own clean electricity, farmers can protect their livelihoods from an increasingly strained grid.

Many farmers across America are choosing solar for its reliability and cleanliness, in turn taking care of the soil, air and water that sustain us all. Solar allows farmers to ensure that the hard work they put into feeding the country is also benefiting the planet as a whole.

Here are three big ways farmers across America are putting solar to work:

Rooftop solar

As sure as the sun rises every morning, rooftop solar is a great way to harness all of that untapped power right on the same buildings that will use it. Barns have ample roof space and can collect a significant amount of energy to power a variety of farm equipment.

Just like so many households and businesses across the country, America’s farmers are reaping the benefits of rooftop solar. PennEnvironment, one of our 30 state groups, toured Shelmar Acres Farm (pictured above) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. After seeing their electricity price skyrocket, they took the plunge, installing solar on their hog barn and have not looked back. Soon after installation, Mitchell and Heather saw their electric bills drop from several thousand dollars a month to a few hundred.

Solar panels across farms: Agrivoltaics

Placing solar panels in strategic locations alongside crops (a practice called agrivoltaics) can have great benefits. Some forward-thinking farmers are installing solar panels on pastures, allowing sheep to graze under solar panel installations. This both prevents plant overgrowth, cutting down on mowing needs, and allows space for sheep to thrive. A study from Western University also highlighted the financial benefits of setups like these.

Agrivoltaics can also be great for pollinators. By planting pollinator friendly plants under solar panel installations, Farmers create some peace and security for bees, butterflies and other wildlife, all while helping to pollinate the surrounding areas. If well designed, pollinator friendly installations can improve crop pollination allowing for potentially higher yields.

Sun-powered equipment

With technology advancing every day, farmers are coming up with more ingenious ways to harness the power of the sun. Solar-powered water pumps are extremely versatile; they can be set up to work anywhere and make lugging gas to generators a thing of the past. Farmers are able to use solar-powered water pumps to irrigate their plants, provide water for their livestock or pump water to reservoirs for storage.

Tractors, UTVs and other utility vehicles all have electric options now, allowing them to be powered by solar, decreasing pollution and noise, long trips to the gas station, and maintenance time. Solar power also has the potential to power electric fences, eliminating the need to replace disposable batteries.",https://environmentamerica.org/center/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC05556-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 06:57:56.015386

Texas. We're known for big hats, presidents, and oil and gas. So it might suprise you that when the Energy Information Administration asks ""how much #windpower is produced in each state?"" the Lone Star State comes out on top. Oh, howdy, Texas:

Earlier this week, ERCOT, the grid operator for most of Texas, announced that wind supplied nearly 10 percent of the state's energy in 2013, up from 9 percent in 2012 and 5 percent in 2008.

Full disclosure: as aTexan I am quite pleased that we're ahead of BOTH California and Oklahoma. Energy is an important piece of Texas history, and wind is as much a part of Texas' story as oil and gas and has its roots back to Ann Richards and George W. Bush's terms as governors of the state along with healthy support from the federal government in terms of a $23/MWh production tax credit, which is on its way out.

This month’s League of Women Voters of Los Alamos (LWV) community event, Lunch with a Leader, is 11:45 a.m. to 1 p.m., Thursday, Oct. 16, at the Unitarian Fellowship Hall on Sage Street. This month’s speaker is award-winning journalist Danielle Prokop.

Prokop was born and raised in Los Alamos. While pursuing international studies at the University of New Mexico, she got her first taste for print at the Daily Lobo, and hasn’t stopped since. After graduation, she worked at the Santa Fe New Mexican, first on the copy desk and eventually on general assignment.

In 2020, Prokop moved (sight unseen) to the western Nebraska panhandle, covering wildfires, water fights and paved road drama for the Scottsbluff Star-Herald. She then headed to far west Texas, embarking on environmental coverage for both sides of the Rio Grande in El Paso.

Prokop returned to writing stories about New Mexico in 2022, first as a freelancer, then full-time staff writer for the online publication Source NM. Her work has included a 14-part series on the Rio Grande from Colorado through New Mexico and west Texas and breaking news inside the Roundhouse and along roads less traveled.

One of the topics she will address during her Thursday talk is whether the role journalism plays in society is changing.

Prokop is an aspiring skier, avid reader and a martial artist. When not at her desk, she can be found reading at a coffee shop, often with her husband, Justin, or out walking their three rescue dogs.",https://ladailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/favicon_30.ico,N,,2025-10-12 01:58:13.490405

If you live in the United States, you could be forgiven for thinking that renewable energy is on the outs. In July, Congress voted to rapidly phase out longstanding tax credit support for wind and solar power, and the Trump administration has taken seemingly every step in its power to halt the development of individual wind and solar projects—even as domestic electricity demand rises and new sources of electricity become more important than ever.

But even as clean energy deployment hit roadblocks in the United States, the world overall set a new record for renewable energy investment over the first half of this year. Wind and solar power are meeting and even exceeding a global rise in energy demand. Indeed, electricity output from these sources is increasing faster than the world can use it, displacing some fossil fuel-generated power in the process. That’s according to a report published Tuesday by Ember, a global energy think tank, which mapped this year’s global power supply by analyzing monthly data from 88 countries that are responsible for more than 90 percent of global electricity demand.

“Overall—we’re talking globally—renewables overtook coal,” said Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember and a co-author of the company’s report. “And I expect this to hold.” This year marks the first time that renewable energy sources have outpowered coal in the global energy mix. In fact, global use of fossil fuels for electricity actually declined slightly, compared to the same period in 2024.

Another report published this week by the International Energy Agency, or IEA, an intergovernmental energy research and policy organization, projects that the quantity of installed renewable power—meaning the maximum amount of energy that can be produced by systems like solar fields, hydroelectric dams, and wind turbines—will more than double by the end of this decade. National policies encouraging the development of green technology as well as astounding drops in the price of solar power—primarily driven by Chinese manufacturers, which build more than 80 percent of the world’s solar energy components—are largely driving the transition.

And even that projection may be conservative.

“The IEA has, consistently over the last couple of decades, way underestimated how fast renewables are growing,” said Robert Brecha, a senior climate and energy adviser at Climate Analytics, a global climate science and policy institute, who was not involved in either the Ember or IEA report. “I don’t see any reason to believe that renewables won’t double by 2030.”

The vast majority of the renewable energy projected to go online in the coming years will come from solar, which already met more than 80 percent of new global energy demand in the first six months of 2025, according to the Ember report. In China, the largest renewable energy growth market in the world, and in India, which is on pace to become the second-largest market, a major uptick in solar energy output is responsible for a historic global decline in coal-generated power.

In the United States and the European Union, however, fossil fuel generation rose in the first half of this year. In Europe, poor wind conditions and drought, rather than state policies, took a bite out of the bloc’s wind and hydroelectric production, leading to a 14-percent rise in gas-fired power. Across the Atlantic, US coal-fired power generation rose 17 percent.

The policy outlook for renewables in the United States is so bleak that the IEA lowered the country’s renewable capacity growth expectations by 50 percent compared to last year’s projections. That US-driven dip drags down the agency’s global projections for renewable energy growth by 5 percent. Overall, however, the IEA still expects renewable energy capacity to grow even faster between 2025 and 2030 than it did between 2020 and 2025.",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-Solar-Farm_2185482692-1.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-11 23:59:01.990003

In Europe, for example, Tesla’s sales fell over 22% in August (year-on-year), shrinking Tesla’s EU EV market share to ~1.5% [70].
The anticipation alone helped drive Tesla’s stock up 5% on Monday Oct 6 ahead of the reveal [77].
Outlook: The Road Ahead for Tesla As of October 11, 2025, Tesla stands at an important inflection point.
If it stalls (perhaps due to economic factors or insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions), Tesla’s growth could moderate.","Stock Price & Performance: Tesla’s share price recently surged to the mid-$450s (up ~5% in one day on Oct 6) after strong sales news, adding roughly $70+ billion to its market cap [1]. However, after a new product reveal on Oct 7, TSLA slipped about 4% (a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction), settling in the low-$430s by week’s end [2]. As of Oct 10, 2025, the stock trades around $435, near the higher end of its 52-week range ($212 – $488) [3]. Tesla is up roughly 12% year-to-date (lagging the S&P 500’s ~17% gain) and an astounding ~80% in the past 12 months [4] [5]. Daily volatility is high, with 4–5% swings not uncommon in recent sessions [6].

Record Q3 Sales:Tesla shattered delivery records in Q3 2025, handing over 497,099 vehicles worldwide [7] – far above Wall Street’s ~443k estimate [8]. Production was ~447k, meaning Tesla sold more cars than it built by drawing down inventory [9]. The 7% YoY delivery growth was fueled by a last-minute demand surge before the U.S. EV tax credit expiration on Sept 30 [10]. Tesla’s aggressive end-of-quarter discounts and financing deals “pulled forward” buyers to beat the deadline [11]. While investors cheered the blowout sales, analysts cautioned it may steal from Q4 demand now that the $7,500 federal incentive has lapsed [12] [13]. Indeed, TSLA initially dipped ~3% on the delivery report as the market pondered a possible Q4 sales slump [14].

“Affordable” Model Y/3 Launch: On Oct 7, Tesla unveiled new lower-cost “Standard Range” versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, priced at $39,990 and $36,990 respectively [15]. These models offer >300 miles of range on smaller batteries but omit premium features (no Autosteer, rear seat heaters, etc.) to cut costs [16] [17]. CEO Elon Musk pitched the trims as “affordable” Teslas for a broader market, acknowledging many people “don’t have enough money” for pricier EVs [18] [19]. However, investors were underwhelmed – TSLA stock tumbled ~4–4.5% after the announcement [20] [21]. Even bullish analysts like Wedbush’s Dan Ives expressed “disappointment” that prices were only ~$5k lower than existing trims [22] [23]. The consensus: this was “a pricing lever, not a product catalyst,” unlikely to unlock massive new demand [24] [25]. Many experts say Tesla “needs a sub-$30k EV” to truly expand its market long-term [26].

Analyst Sentiment & Targets: Wall Street’s view on TSLA is highly divided. Big-name bulls remain optimistic: Morgan Stanley recently reiterated an Overweight (Buy) rating with a $410 target [27], Piper Sandler hiked its target from $400 to $500 [28], and Wedbush’s Dan Ives is all the way up at $600, one of the Street’s highest forecasts [29]. They cite Tesla’s momentum in EVs, software, and energy as justification for a premium valuation [30] [31]. However, the average 12-month price target is only ~$351, implying analysts on the whole think the stock is overvalued at current levels [32]. Roughly half of analysts rate TSLA a Hold or Sell [33], flagging the lofty valuation (~250× earnings) and slowing growth as concerns [34] [35]. Notably, HSBC recently stuck to a “Reduce” (Sell) rating and a mere $127 target despite the strong Q3 sales – implying ~70% downside [36]. In short, sentiment ranges from ultra-bullish to deeply skeptical, reflecting Tesla’s polarizing dual identity as both carmaker and high-growth tech play.

Tesla’s Strategic Shifts: Tesla is doubling down on its core EV business while also branching into new frontiers. The company’s energy division just had a record quarter, deploying 12.5 GWh of battery storage (Powerwalls, Megapacks, etc.) – more than all of 2024’s total – signaling rapid growth in Tesla’s solar/storage segment [37]. Musk is also heavily emphasizing AI and automation: Tesla’s vehicles have logged 7+ billion miles on Autopilot/FSD, giving it the world’s largest self-driving dataset [38], and in 2025 Tesla even launched a pilot robotaxi service (using driverless Model Ys in Austin) [39]. Musk touts upcoming Full Self-Driving software updates that feel “almost sentient” [40], and Tesla continues to showcase its “Optimus” humanoid robot prototype – though that remains a longer-term project [41]. On the automotive side, Tesla’s lineup is both expanding “broader and cheaper” (e.g. the new Model Y/3 variants) to fend off competition, and looking ahead to futuristic products (Cybertruck, Robotaxi) and services. Investors are watching whether Tesla can execute on these initiatives without sacrificing margins, as recent price cuts have squeezed profitability (automotive gross margin has slid to mid-single digits) [42]. Overall, Tesla’s current strategy aims to balance near-term growth (via volume and price tweaks) with long-term innovation in AI and clean energy – a tricky but potentially rewarding path.

Recent Stock Performance: From Rally to Pullback

Tesla’s stock has seen dramatic swings in early October 2025. After trading in the low-$400s to start the month, TSLA spiked on October 6 ahead of a big product announcement, jumping ~5.4% in one session to close at $453.25 [43]. That surge – adding over $70 billion in market cap – was fueled by optimism around record Q3 sales and a teased new model. It capped a strong short-term run: Tesla shares climbed roughly 7–8% over the first two weeks of October, outperforming the broader market (the S&P 500 rose more modestly) [44] [45]. Notably, 7 of 10 trading days were positive during that stretch [46]. At mid-$450s, Tesla was trading near its 52-week high (~$488) and more than 50% above its yearly low (~$212) [47]. In fact, over the past 12 months TSLA was up about 81%, a huge run compared to ~17% for the S&P 500 in the same period [48].

However, volatility remains part of Tesla’s story. After the Oct 6 rally, traders turned skittish once details of the new product came out. On Oct 7–8, TSLA pulled back roughly 4% – essentially erasing the early-week pop [49]. The stock dropped from the mid-$450s back to around $430–$435, as investors “sold the news” when Tesla’s “affordable” Model Y/3 pricing disappointed some expectations [50]. By the end of that week, Tesla settled in the low-$430s (still up slightly from a week prior). These whipsaw moves underline Tesla’s elevated volatility: in recent weeks, daily swings of 4–5% have been common [51]. Short-term traders note the stock became overbought after the run-up – technical indicators like RSI signaled stretched conditions [52]. Indeed, TSLA’s relative strength index hit levels that often precede a breather, and some chart analysts pegged support around ~$410 and near-term resistance around ~$530 [53]. In other words, the stock’s momentum is strong, but it wouldn’t be surprising to see consolidation or profit-taking after such a steep rise.

From a broader lens, Tesla’s year-to-date performance is decent but not market-leading. As of early October, TSLA was up roughly 12% in 2025 [54]. That trails the S&P 500 (which is up ~17% YTD) [55], reflecting that Tesla had some choppiness earlier in the year. However, the recent rally significantly boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to around $1.5 trillion [56] – putting it among the world’s top 10 most valuable companies. The stock’s 52-week range (about $212 to $488 [57]) highlights how far it has climbed from last year’s lows, but also the fact that it’s only ~6–10% shy of new all-time highs. This lofty perch means valuation metrics are stretched (more on that later), and it raises the stakes for Tesla to deliver consistently strong results to justify the price. In sum, Tesla’s recent stock performance has been a mix of euphoria and volatility – typical for TSLA – with rapid gains driven by excitement over sales and products, tempered by quick pullbacks whenever reality checks in.

Recent News: Record Q3 Deliveries and New Model Reveals

Tesla kicked off October with headline-grabbing news on multiple fronts. First, on October 2, the company reported record-breaking vehicle delivery numbers for Q3 2025. Tesla delivered 497,099 cars in the quarter [58], an all-time high and well above analyst forecasts in the mid-440k range [59]. This marked about 7.4% growth year-over-year [60], a notable rebound considering Tesla’s deliveries had actually declined YoY in the first half of 2025 amid economic headwinds [61]. The Q3 production figure was ~447k vehicles [62], meaning Tesla sold more cars than it built, drawing down some inventory – a sign of strong demand (at least temporarily). The Model 3 and Model Y remained the workhorses, accounting for the vast majority of sales (over 481k of the 497k) while higher-priced Models S/X and the new Cybertruck comprised the remainder [63].

What drove this Q3 sales surge? In a word: incentives. U.S. buyers rushed to take delivery before a major federal EV subsidy expired on Sept 30. Tesla had been benefiting from a $7,500 federal tax credit on many of its models, but due to how the law was structured (with volume and battery sourcing criteria), that credit was set to phase out for Tesla at the end of Q3 [64]. Knowing this, Tesla “pulled out all the stops” in Q3 – offering discounts, special financing deals, and even running social media ads – to entice customers to buy before the credit vanished [65]. The strategy worked: many would-be buyers hurried to lock in the expiring $7.5k credit, resulting in a huge end-of-quarter sales push [66]. Analysts described it as “pulled-forward” demand – essentially Tesla borrowed sales from the future (Q4) to boost Q3 [67]. An ETF manager, Elliot Johnson, warned this won’t be sustainable, predicting “we could see a soft couple of quarters” ahead [68]. Indeed, Tesla’s stock initially dropped ~3–4% on the delivery report [69], as investors digested the idea that Q4 might slump now that the tax-credit rush is over.

Tesla’s team acknowledged some regional weaknesses despite the record global number. In Europe, for example, Tesla’s sales fell over 22% in August (year-on-year), shrinking Tesla’s EU EV market share to ~1.5% [70]. European consumers are increasingly drawn to a flood of new EV options – including popular plug-in hybrids and lower-cost Chinese-made EVs – forcing Tesla to respond with price cuts and promotions [71]. By contrast, China was a bright spot: strong demand for the refreshed Model Y and a new long-wheelbase Model Y “L” variant helped boost Tesla’s sales in China [72]. (Tesla introduced the Model Y “L” in September specifically to appeal to Chinese families, as part of a strategy to tailor products to local markets [73].) Tesla also notched a win in its energy business during Q3: it deployed 12.5 GWh of battery storage (Powerwall home batteries, grid-scale Megapacks, etc.), exceeding analyst expectations (~11 GWh) and even surpassing the total storage deployment in all of 2024 [74]. This suggests Tesla’s energy segment – often overshadowed by the car business – is scaling quickly, providing a valuable additional revenue stream [75].

Just as the dust settled from the delivery report, Tesla teased a major product announcement for Oct 7, 2025. Over the prior weekend, the company’s official account on X (Twitter) posted cryptic teaser videos – glowing headlights in the dark, a spinning wheel – ending with the date “10/7” [76]. This sparked rampant speculation of a new, more affordable vehicle launch. The anticipation alone helped drive Tesla’s stock up 5% on Monday Oct 6 ahead of the reveal [77]. Come October 7, Tesla indeed unveiled “Standard Range” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, positioned as cheaper trims to broaden the buyer base. The Model Y Standard now starts at $39,990, and the Model 3 Standard at $36,990 [78] – roughly a 15% price reduction compared to the previous base models [79]. To hit these lower price points, Tesla trimmed some features: the Standard versions have slightly smaller batteries (but still ~320 miles of range), slower acceleration, and they lack certain amenities like Tesla’s Autosteer driver assist, rear heated seats, the upgraded audio system, and even minor touches like the LED lightbar on the Model Y [80] [81]. They also come with manual side mirrors and textile (cloth) seats by default, though buyers can pay extra for vegan leather in the Model 3 [82].

Musk’s pitch for these models was straightforward: boosting affordability to counter a tough market. “The desire to buy the car is very high… [it’s] just people don’t have enough money,” Musk said on a prior earnings call, “so the more affordable we can make the car, the better.” [83] By launching sub-$40k versions, Tesla is attempting to revive demand amid sagging sales growth and the loss of U.S. tax credits [84] [85]. Importantly, these new Standard Range cars can be ordered immediately, with deliveries slated to begin in Dec 2025–Jan 2026 in many regions [86] – timing that could help Tesla shore up Q4 and early 2026 sales.

Market reaction, however, was mixed. While some applauded Tesla for finally breaking below the $40k psychological barrier, many analysts felt the move was “not enough” to significantly expand Tesla’s audience [87]. The ~$5,000 price cut versus prior base models was seen as relatively small – “basically a pricing lever and not much of a product catalyst,” as Futurum Research strategist Shay Boloor put it [88] [89]. The fear is that these “affordable” Teslas might simply prompt existing Tesla intenders to choose a cheaper trim (cannibalizing some higher-trim sales) rather than bringing new budget-conscious buyers into the fold [90] [91]. Wedbush’s Dan Ives (a longtime Tesla bull) bluntly said he was “disappointed” by the modest price drop, expecting more aggressive cuts to fend off competitors [92]. Meanwhile, Shawn Campbell of Camelthorn Investments argued “I just don’t know that this is enough… Tesla needs a sub-$30k EV” to truly counter the onslaught of lower-cost Chinese models globally [93]. On Wall Street, traders had largely priced in a big announcement, so when the news proved incremental, TSLA’s stock fell ~4.5% on Oct 7 [94]. Essentially, the market “bought the rumor, sold the news” – Tesla’s huge rally earlier that week was given back once details emerged [95].

Despite the initial stock dip, Tesla executives likely view the Standard Range launch as a strategic pivot to defend market share. It shows Tesla is willing to sacrifice some margin for volume, which could be crucial as EV competition heats up. The move also anticipates new rivals: for instance, GM’s Chevrolet is launching an Equinox EV around ~$30k in 2024–25, and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 and Kia’s EV4 are targeting similar segments [96]. By pricing just under $40k, Tesla at least narrows the gap. Still, some industry watchers nicknamed Tesla’s approach as “dropping its Steve Jobs turtleneck for a Walmart hoodie” – i.e. Tesla shedding a bit of its premium aura to play in the mass market [97]. One investment officer quipped that Tesla is “no longer the cool rebel at the edge of innovation – it’s the establishment trying to play both Tesla and Toyota at once.” [98] Time will tell if this balancing act pays off by boosting unit sales without diluting Tesla’s brand or profits.

Analyst Ratings and Market Sentiment: Bulls vs. Bears

Tesla is one of the most polarizing stocks on Wall Street, and the recent developments have only amplified the divide between bulls and bears. Optimistic analysts (“bulls”) view Tesla not just as a car company but as a transformational tech leader spanning electric vehicles, software, and energy – a narrative reinforced by the Q3 delivery beat and new product momentum. For example, Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its Overweight (Buy) rating right after the blowout delivery report, keeping a $410 price target [99]. Morgan Stanley’s lead auto analyst Adam Jonas highlighted Tesla’s “strong momentum” and multi-pronged growth engines (EV market dominance, Full Self-Driving software potential, and a booming energy storage business) as reasons Tesla can justify a rich valuation [100] [101]. Similarly, Piper Sandler’s team (led by Alexander Potter) has been bullish – they reportedly raised their TSLA target from $400 to $500 in late September while maintaining an overweight stance [102]. And perhaps the most outspoken bull, Dan Ives of Wedbush, is at the high end with a ~$600 price target [103]. Ives believes Tesla’s recent catalysts (the record deliveries, new cheaper Model Y, progress in AI/robotaxis) could significantly boost long-term earnings power [104]. These bullish analysts argue Tesla is far more than an automaker – pointing to its vast trove of driving data (over 7 billion miles on Autopilot) and its subscription-like revenue from software and energy products as evidence that Tesla can eventually deliver higher-margin tech/services revenue alongside car sales [105] [106]. Firms like Cantor Fitzgerald have likewise chimed in, recently reiterating an Overweight rating and praising Tesla’s execution after the delivery surprise [107]. In short, the bull camp believes Tesla’s growth story is intact and expanding – and that its hefty valuation will be earned as the company grows into new markets (energy, autonomous ride-hailing, possibly robotics).

On the flip side, a large segment of analysts take a cautious or neutral stance, and a minority are firmly bearish. As of early October, the consensus 12-month price target for Tesla was only about $351 [108]. With the stock hovering around $450, that implies the average analyst sees ~20–25% downside risk from current prices [109] [110]. Ratings-wise, the Street is roughly split down the middle: out of ~34 major analysts covering Tesla, about 11 rate it a Buy, 16 as Hold, and 7 as Sell [111]. Those in the neutral camp often acknowledge Tesla’s strengths and recent wins but express concern that expectations have run ahead of fundamentals. One illustrative data point: Tesla’s trailing 12-month revenue (~$93 billion) was actually down ~12% year-over-year (due to earlier slowdowns and price cuts), even as the stock price climbed, leading to what one report called an “extreme valuation expansion.” [112] In concrete terms, Tesla is trading around 250 times earnings and ~16–17 times sales – sky-high multiples that assume significant future growth [113] [114]. By comparison, other carmakers trade at single-digit P/Es, and even most tech giants trade at a fraction of Tesla’s valuation. Margin pressure is another worry: with all the price reductions, Tesla’s vehicle gross profit margins have fallen from around 25%+ a year ago to the mid-teens or even single digits now [115]. (Some estimates put Tesla’s automotive gross margin ex-credits in the high single digits in recent quarters [116].) Slower growth + thinner margins = caution for these analysts, who fear Tesla might not meet the lofty earnings implied by its stock price.

Bearish analysts take it a step further, arguing that Tesla is dramatically overvalued and could have a nasty come-down. A notable example is HSBC, which in October reiterated a “Reduce” (Sell) rating. After the strong delivery report, HSBC did raise its price target – but only to $127 [117]. That’s essentially saying Tesla’s stock could fall over 70%. The bear case typically asserts that Tesla’s growth is maturing and facing headwinds: competition is eroding its market share (as seen in Europe’s decline), Tesla’s repeated price cuts indicate demand needs artificial boosting, and if you value Tesla more like a normal automaker (even a premium one), the current valuation is absurdly high [118] [119]. Bears also point to Tesla’s reliance on regulatory credits to pad profits and the possibility that as EV markets mature, Tesla’s first-mover advantage will shrink. Some skeptics are wary of Elon Musk’s unpredictable management style as a risk factor – for instance, concern that Musk’s other ventures (SpaceX, running X/Twitter, etc.) could distract him, or that his cavalier approach to things like timelines and regulatory issues might backfire. Overall, the bearish view is that Tesla’s stock price already reflects “perfection” – any stumble in execution or demand could lead to a major correction.

This stark divergence in views is encapsulated by the extremely wide range of analyst price targets: from about $120 on the low end to $600 on the high end [120] [121]. Such a spread is highly unusual for a company of Tesla’s size and speaks to the unique nature of Tesla’s investment thesis. Is it a high-growth tech disrupter that will double its value with new businesses, or a highly valued car company that could crash back to earth? At present, the average target of ~$351 implies many analysts think TSLA has overshot its fundamentals by ~20-30% [122] [123]. Those fundamentals will be tested soon – Tesla’s Q3 financial results in late October and any guidance about Q4 demand will be key inputs for analysts updating their models [124]. For now, sentiment remains split, and Tesla’s stock continues to trade on future potential vs. present reality, depending on whom you ask.

Expert Commentary and Forecasts

Amid the analyst debates, financial experts and commentators have been offering insight into Tesla’s future performance. On the bullish side, many point to Tesla’s expanding opportunities in software and services. “Tesla’s dominant position in EVs, first-mover advantage in autonomy, and burgeoning energy business support its extraordinary valuation,” noted one analysis [125]. Bulls often highlight cross-platform synergies – for instance, Tesla’s ability to leverage data and AI from its car fleet into other areas like self-driving taxis or even robots, and to use its automotive scale to grow its stationary battery business. These unique combinations, they argue, make Tesla more than the sum of its parts and justify thinking of it as a high-growth tech platform rather than a car company.

On the cautious side, some experts flag Tesla’s recent financial trends as a sign of overextension. One report observed that Tesla’s revenue growth has stalled relative to its stock price – in fact, trailing 12-month revenue slightly declined (due to earlier delivery dips and pricing actions) while the stock ran up, leading to an unsustainable spike in valuation multiples [126]. That same report pointed out Tesla’s P/E above 250 and price-to-sales ~17, calling it an “eye-watering” valuation more fitting a cloud software company than a manufacturer [127]. To put it in perspective, even looking ahead a few years: Bloomberg analysts project Tesla might earn around $5.5 billion in annual profit by 2028, and if one applied a generous tech-sector P/E of 20× to that, it would only imply a $150–$250 stock price – far below today’s $450+ [128] [129]. This kind of exercise underscores why some value-focused investors think TSLA could halve in price if growth disappoints [130]. On the flip side, the most optimistic forecasts see Tesla doubling from here if things like robotaxi networks or mass-market cars take off and dramatically boost earnings [131] [132]. Such extreme outcomes – both up and down – are what make Tesla such a hot topic; it’s a high-reward, high-risk story.

We also heard direct commentary from Tesla’s Q3 delivery fallout. Elliot Johnson of Evolve ETFs, as mentioned, cautioned that the Q3 surge was not likely sustainable and that “we could see a soft couple of quarters” ahead as the pulled-ahead demand leaves a gap [133]. Regarding the new Standard models, Shay Boloor (Futurum Equities) commented that Tesla’s move is “not unlocking new demand at scale” and is more of a one-time pricing adjustment [134]. Dan Ives (Wedbush) – normally very bullish – voiced rare disappointment, essentially saying Tesla underwhelmed with only a minor price trim when expectations were higher [135]. On the other hand, some experts see the lower-priced models as necessary chess moves. “Dropping below $40k will help drive sales as [Tesla] competes next year with Chevy’s Equinox EV, Hyundai, Kia, etc.,” one investor noted [136], even if they hoped for a bigger cut to <$30k. There’s also acknowledgment that Tesla’s execution in Q3 was impressive – nearly 500k deliveries in a quarter was once unimaginable for an EV company. “Nearly 500k deliveries in a quarter is unprecedented for an EV maker,” as one commentator noted, adding that it shows Tesla can deliver volume when it pulls the right levers (in this case, incentives and pricing) [137].

Looking ahead, expert forecasts diverge mainly on whether Tesla can maintain its growth and expand into new markets fast enough to justify its valuation. Bulls like ARK Invest (Cathie Wood’s firm) – not quoted above but known publicly – have extremely high long-term targets based on scenarios of Tesla dominating autonomous ride-hailing and other fields. More conventional bulls, as we saw, peg upside around $500–600 if things go well [138]. Bears use more traditional models and often come out with targets in the low $100s (or even double-digit stock prices) if Tesla’s growth slows or if it gets valued more like an automaker. Many neutral analysts are in the $250–$350 range, essentially betting Tesla will execute decently but not perfectly. A key near-term factor will be Tesla’s Q3 earnings report on Oct 18 (and any guidance given) – analysts will parse margins, any commentary on order backlogs post-tax-credit, and Tesla’s cost management, especially with these new lower-priced vehicles in the mix. Additionally, Tesla’s 2025 outlook (perhaps hinted at in January’s Investor Day or in guidance) will shape forecasts: if Musk and team guide to reaccelerating growth (perhaps with the Cybertruck ramp or a next-gen vehicle), bulls will feel vindicated; if they emphasize margin and moderate growth, the valuation concerns could grow.

In summary, expert opinions range from “Tesla will continue to conquer new markets and justify its sky-high valuation” to “Tesla’s stock is due for a reality check.” This dynamic tension in forecasts is part of why Tesla’s stock is so volatile – news that supports one side or the other (e.g. a big beat or miss, a new product reveal, etc.) can swing market sentiment sharply. For the average observer, it’s wise to recognize that Tesla’s future is hard to pigeonhole: it has elements of an auto business, a tech company, and even a renewable energy utility. As one report put it, Tesla encapsulates a “dual nature: part established automaker, part speculative tech disruptor.” [139] This duality will likely continue to drive debate among experts and keep Tesla a closely watched stock.

Tesla’s Strategic Direction: EVs, Energy, AI, and More

Underpinning both the bull and bear cases is Tesla’s multifaceted strategic direction. The company is not standing still – it’s simultaneously pushing the envelope in technology and adjusting its core business strategy in the face of competition.

Electric Vehicles (EVs) remain Tesla’s core, and here the strategy has evolved in 2025 to defend its market lead. Tesla once rarely advertised or cut prices due to overwhelming demand; now it’s entering a phase of competitive pricing and product segmentation. The launch of the Standard Range models is a prime example – Tesla is willing to trim features and margin to broaden its customer base, signaling a more pragmatic, volume-driven approach as the EV market matures. Tesla is also tailoring cars to regions: e.g., the Model Y “L” variant in China (a longer-wheelbase Model Y to cater to Chinese families) [140], and constant software updates to adapt to local needs (charging standards, languages, etc.). On the horizon is the Cybertruck, Tesla’s futuristic pickup, which finally started deliveries in limited numbers (reportedly ~52,000 units sold since its late-2023 debut, which is modest) [141]. The Cybertruck is part of Tesla’s strategy to enter new segments (pickups, which are huge in the U.S.) and showcase engineering innovation (its stainless-steel body and novel design). However, its slow initial ramp shows Tesla faces challenges scaling completely new models. Musk has hinted at even more vehicles: a next-generation “$25k car” (often dubbed the Model 2 by fans) and a purpose-built robotaxi vehicle. In the recent earnings calls, Musk tempered expectations by noting a $25k personal car isn’t a priority (focusing on robotaxi development instead) [142] [143]. Tesla says an actual robotaxi vehicle (with no steering wheel) might debut around 2026, but that’s still speculative. In sum, Tesla’s automotive strategy is two-pronged: maintain dominance in premium EVs (with continuous improvements to Models S,3,X,Y and new high-end tech like Plaid drivetrains), and expand into new niches and price points to keep growth going (trucks, cheaper cars, etc.).

Beyond cars, Tesla’s Energy & Storage division is becoming a bigger part of the strategy. Q3’s record 12.5 GWh of battery storage deployments [144] highlight that Tesla is effectively building a second business alongside automotive. Products like the Megapack (a large battery for utilities) are in high demand from power companies and large facilities aiming to store renewable energy. In fact, Tesla’s Q3 storage deployments beat Wall Street estimates by ~14% [145], and even exceeded what Tesla installed in all of last year [146]. Musk and CFO Zach Kirkhorn have often said that Tesla’s energy business could one day rival its automotive business in size. The strategy here is to leverage Tesla’s battery know-how and scale (from making car batteries) into grid storage and home energy. This provides a more stable revenue source (energy contracts can have long-term orders) and helps even out the cyclicality of auto sales. It also aligns with Tesla’s mission of accelerating sustainable energy. By investing in more battery production (the Nevada Gigafactory expansion, a new cathode facility in Texas, etc.), Tesla is ensuring it has the capacity to grow both the car and energy sides. Analysts note that a booming energy segment could stabilize Tesla’s margins over time, since software and services can be layered on (e.g., Tesla’s Autobidder software that helps utilities manage energy storage) [147]. Tesla’s solar panel/roof business is also part of this division, though it’s been relatively quiet – solar installations are steady but not growing explosively. The bigger focus is on stationary battery packs, where Tesla sees huge global demand as grids transition to renewables.

Arguably the most exciting (and controversial) aspect of Tesla’s strategy is its focus on Artificial Intelligence and autonomous technology. Musk has famously said “Tesla is as much an AI company as it is a car company.” In practice, this means Tesla is pouring resources into its Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, its Dojo supercomputer (a custom AI training computer to process video data from Tesla cars), and even AI robotics. In 2025, Tesla’s FSD Beta is still classified as a Level 2 driver assist (the human driver must remain attentive), but Musk insists they are inching towards higher autonomy. He recently hyped FSD version 14, hinting it might make cars feel “almost sentient” [148] – an exaggeration perhaps, but indicative of Tesla’s rapid software iterations. Tesla has a unique strategy of deploying beta self-driving features to hundreds of thousands of customers, collecting massive amounts of real-world driving data (over 7 billion miles driven on Autopilot/FSD to date) [149]. This data feeds Tesla’s AI models to improve the system. In mid-2025, Tesla even launched a pilot robotaxi service in Austin, Texas – essentially letting a small fleet of Model Ys with FSD give rides with no human driver, within a limited geo-fenced area [150]. While still very early (and with safety personnel overseeing), it marked one of the first attempts at a commercial driverless ride-hailing service by an automaker [151]. Tesla’s strategy contrasts with players like Waymo or Cruise, which use custom hardware and have limited operations; Tesla is betting it can achieve autonomy via consumer cars that double as robotaxis. Regulators remain cautious – no country yet allows full Level 5 autonomy at scale, and U.S. regulators (NHTSA) are investigating Tesla’s Autopilot safety in some contexts [152]. But Musk’s vision is that once the tech and regulatory pieces fall into place, Tesla could activate a vast robotaxi network, generating revenue from rides (think of Teslas earning money for owners while they’re not in use). This potential is a key part of Tesla’s long-term strategy and one reason some investors value it like a tech company.

Tesla is also exploring humanoid robots with its Optimus prototype, revealed in 2022 and updated in 2023. In 2025, Optimus is still in development, but Musk occasionally shows progress (videos of the robot walking, picking up objects). The strategy here is leveraging Tesla’s AI (vision, neural nets, actuators from car manufacturing) to eventually create robots for factory work or other tasks. It’s a moonshot project – not contributing to revenue now – but it underscores Tesla’s willingness to invest in futuristic tech that could pay off in the long run. Musk even said the humanoid robot market might become bigger than the car market someday. While that’s speculative, it’s clear Tesla wants to be at the forefront of AI-driven robotics, not just vehicles.

Finally, Tesla’s strategy involves heavy vertical integration and investment in manufacturing to support all the above. The company continues to expand its Gigafactories (a new plant in Monterrey, Mexico is planned, as well as expansion of the Nevada and Texas factories). It produces its own batteries (with Panasonic and others as partners) and is developing in-house battery chemistries (like 4680 cells) to improve range and reduce costs. Tesla’s ability to control much of its supply chain (from software down to many hardware components) is a strategic advantage that it’s carrying into new areas – for example, designing its own AI chips for self-driving (the FSD computer and Dojo chips) rather than relying on third parties. This integration often lets Tesla move faster or achieve better efficiency, though it also means it shoulders more of the upfront R&D costs.

In summary, Tesla’s strategic direction in late 2025 is a blend of offense and defense: offensively pushing into new realms like AI services, robotaxis, energy storage, and perhaps one day robots, while defensively cutting prices and expanding its product lineup to protect its EV lead against a growing pack of competitors. It’s a lot to juggle, and it explains why Tesla’s story is both exciting and, at times, concerning to investors. The company is effectively rewriting the playbook for what an automaker can be, aiming to be a renewable energy and technology powerhouse. Success in even a few of these domains could justify bulls’ optimism; stumbling in them could validate the skeptics. Tesla’s strategic bets will be critical to watch as we head into 2026 and beyond.

Competitive Landscape: Tesla vs. Automakers and Tech Rivals

Tesla’s rise has spurred virtually every automaker in the world to race toward electric vehicles, and that competition is now intensifying markedly. In 2025, Tesla still leads in many metrics – it’s often the top seller of EVs in markets like the U.S. and Europe, and it enjoys better profit margins on EVs than most peers – but the gap is closing.

U.S. competition: Legacy giants General Motors and Ford have rolled out high-profile EVs (e.g. Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric pickup, GM’s Hummer EV, Cadillac Lyriq, Chevy Bolt/Equinox EV, etc.). While none has matched Tesla’s sales yet, they are starting to nibble at various segments. However, these companies face their own challenges: in 2025 both GM and Ford saw slowing EV sales growth and even pulled back some targets, citing supply chain issues and weaker demand than expected. They also dealt with a major UAW labor strike in 2025, which disrupted production and could raise their labor costs, potentially affecting their EV rollouts. Tesla, notably, is not unionized and didn’t face that issue, which some analysts view as a competitive cost advantage (though it’s a point of contention socially). Rivian and Lucid, two U.S. EV startups, also compete in the high-end space. Rivian’s electric trucks/SUVs have gotten good reviews but are still produced in modest volumes (perhaps ~50k/year), and Lucid’s luxury sedans are niche and pricey. So in the U.S., Tesla’s main competition in 2025 is actually coming from future models promised by the big automakers (like Chevy’s ~$30k Equinox EV or Ford’s next-gen crossovers) rather than any one model beating Tesla’s Model 3/Y in sales right now. But Tesla’s U.S. market share in EVs has slipped from its near-monopoly a few years ago as more models enter – consumers can now choose a Mustang Mach-E, a Kia EV6, etc., whereas before Tesla was one of few options. This is partly why Tesla has been cutting prices in the U.S., to stay ahead of new entrants.

China competition: The fiercest EV battlefield is China, the world’s largest auto market. Here, Tesla faces dozens of competitors, from established players to startups, often with backing from tech giants or the government. The standout is BYD, which has become an EV powerhouse. BYD sells EVs (and plug-in hybrids) at a variety of price points – many models undercut Tesla on price in China, and BYD’s yearly sales (including hybrids) are on par with or higher than Tesla’s global sales. BYD is selling roughly 3 million vehicles annually (many of them in the affordable segment) [153] [154]. Tesla’s response has been to repeatedly cut prices in China on models like the Model Y, to the point where its cars have at times been cheaper in China than in the U.S. for identical configurations. Despite that, Tesla’s China sales have grown, but market share is tough to hold because domestic brands are so numerous (NIO, Xpeng, Li Auto, Geely’s Zeekr, SAIC’s brands, etc.). Chinese EV makers have also started expanding globally – for instance, BYD and NIO are entering Europe with compelling models. This is significant: Tesla’s rumored $25k car or the new Model Y Standard are essentially aimed at countering the BYD effect – i.e., the rise of sub-$30k electric cars that could flood markets worldwide [155] [156]. China was a strong point for Tesla in Q3 thanks to the refreshed Model Y and a localized strategy, but it’s a constant fight. The Chinese government’s policies also play a role: they had EV subsidies that were reduced in 2023, sparking a price war (which Tesla participated in). Now China’s economy has been a bit shaky (property market issues, etc.), so demand isn’t unlimited. Tesla navigates this by producing very efficiently at Giga Shanghai (which is one of Tesla’s most cost-efficient plants) and exporting some output to Europe and other Asian markets when Chinese demand softens.

Europe competition: Europe is a mature auto market with strong domestic brands, and they’ve aggressively pushed into EVs, partly due to EU emissions regulations. Companies like Volkswagen Group (VW, Audi, Porsche, etc.), BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis (Peugeot, Fiat, etc.), and newcomers like Hyundai/Kia (Korea) are all vying for European EV buyers. Europe also has several EV incentives and mandates (though some subsidies have been reduced recently [157]). Tesla’s market share in Europe has seen pressure: as noted, its share fell to around 1.5% in the EU for new car sales, after a sharp drop in its European deliveries in Q3 [158]. Part of that was the winding down of backlogged orders and increased local competition. Notably, European consumers have many choices under €30k that Tesla doesn’t match – e.g. the Renault Zoe, VW ID.3 (with subsidies), various smaller EVs, and even plug-in hybrids which remain popular (and Tesla doesn’t make any hybrids) [159] [160]. Additionally, some analysts speculate that Musk’s polarizing public persona (political comments on X, etc.) may have dented Tesla’s brand in parts of Europe, which is generally more climate-conscious and sometimes put off by controversy [161]. To fight back, Tesla opened a factory in Germany (Giga Berlin) to localize production of Model Y and eventually Model 3, which helps avoid import tariffs and improves delivery times. It also slashed prices in Europe multiple times in 2023–25. Still, as of late 2025, Tesla is facing an “EV price war” in Europe too, especially with a wave of Chinese-made EVs starting to hit Europe (brands like MG, BYD, NIO) and with European incumbents offering lease deals and incentives. Tesla’s new standard models and any future cheaper car will be crucial for Europe, where a significant chunk of the market is below €35k – a segment Tesla hasn’t played in until now.

Tech company competition: While no tech giant directly sells EVs yet (Apple’s long-rumored car is not out; Google’s Waymo is focusing on self-driving tech, not selling cars), Tesla often finds itself compared to or competing with tech firms in specific areas. For example, in autonomous driving, Waymo (Google) and Cruise (GM, but run like a tech startup) are rivals in creating robotaxi services. In 2023–2025, Waymo and Cruise began offering limited robo-taxi rides in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. However, they hit some roadblocks – for instance, in late 2023, Cruise’s permit was suspended in San Francisco after some safety incidents. Waymo is methodical but slow, expanding carefully. This actually made Tesla’s approach look better to some investors, because Tesla avoids the regulatory bottleneck by selling “self-driving” to consumers rather than operating public taxis (so far) [162] [163]. Apple is another potential competitor – while no Apple Car exists yet, the tech giant has poached Tesla engineers and reportedly aims to launch an autonomous EV later in the decade. If Apple or others succeed, Tesla would be competing on tech, brand, and ecosystem (imagine an Apple car integrated with iOS – Tesla would need to match that experience). In the energy space, Tesla’s competitors include battery makers and industrial firms (like LG, Panasonic – though Panasonic is also a partner – and energy storage firms like Fluence). But Tesla’s brand recognition in energy isn’t as strong as in cars, so it’s carving its niche with the Megapack which currently is selling as fast as they can make them.

Overall, the competitive landscape means Tesla can’t rest on its laurels. This is evident from its changing tactics: more frequent pricing adjustments (in 2023–25, Tesla cut prices globally dozens of times, something it rarely did before), actual marketing efforts (Tesla has started running ads for the first time in its history, albeit small-scale, and Musk said in 2023 they’d “try a little advertising”), and focus on cost-cutting to preserve margins while prices fall. It’s a new phase – for years Tesla demand outstripped supply; now supply is catching up industry-wide, and Tesla must compete for each sale. The good news for Tesla is that the overall EV market is growing – EVs are now ~15% of new car sales worldwide and climbing [164]. As the pie grows, Tesla can grow even if its slice gets a bit smaller percentage-wise. But Tesla’s lofty valuation is predicated on being a dominant leader, so the company is clearly fighting to retain an edge. Its scale (expected ~1.8 million+ deliveries in 2025), strong brand, and technology lead (especially in software and charging network) are advantages that competitors respect. In fact, Ford, GM, and others agreed in 2023–24 to adopt Tesla’s charging plug standard (NACS) for their EVs – effectively bowing to Tesla’s superior charging network. Moves like that indicate Tesla is still setting industry norms. Yet, competition will only intensify from here, so Tesla’s next steps – whether it’s launching that $25k car, continuing to cut prices, or innovating in autonomy – will be crucial to maintain its position in an increasingly crowded field.

Macroeconomic and Policy Factors Influencing TSLA

While company-specific news often grabs headlines, broader macroeconomic trends and government policies play a big role in Tesla’s performance and valuation. Here are a few key factors as of late 2025:

Interest Rates and Economic Climate: After a period of high inflation and rapid interest rate hikes in 2022–2024, the macro backdrop in 2025 is at a turning point. High-growth stocks like Tesla are sensitive to interest rates because higher rates reduce the present value of future earnings (and Tesla’s valuation depends on big profits years from now). Throughout 2023 and into 2024, as central banks raised rates, growth stocks saw pressure. By October 2025, however, there’s a growing hope that the Federal Reserve is done hiking rates – and might even cut rates in 2026 if inflation continues to cool [165] [166]. This prospect has improved sentiment for tech and growth stocks broadly, Tesla included. Indeed, part of Tesla’s strong stock rebound in 2023–25 was due to a market-wide shift back into tech/growth as investors anticipated a peak in rates. Additionally, the U.S. economy showed resilience (no official recession through 2025, unemployment stayed relatively low), which meant consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars held up reasonably well. That said, borrowing costs are still much higher than a few years ago – auto loan rates in 2025 are significantly above those in 2020. For a company like Tesla that sells cars averaging $50k, high interest rates are a headwind because they make monthly payments more expensive for consumers. Tesla has addressed this by offering its own discounted financing deals (e.g. low APR promotions via Tesla Financing) to spur sales [167]. Going forward, if the economy stays solid or interest rates begin to ease, it’s a tailwind for Tesla – more affordable financing and a risk-on attitude in markets. Conversely, any economic downturn or credit crunch would quickly hit auto demand (cars are discretionary purchases for many) and could make investors less willing to pay high multiples for Tesla’s stock. So far, Tesla navigated the post-pandemic chip shortage and inflation period by cutting costs and prices to keep volume growing. It will continue to be influenced by macro trends like GDP growth, consumer confidence, and interest rate moves.

EV Tax Credits and Government Policy: Government incentives have been both a boon and a challenge for Tesla. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced generous EV tax credits, but with complex rules about manufacturing location and vehicle price caps. Tesla benefited initially – many Model 3/Y variants qualified for $7,500 credits in 2023 – which effectively made Teslas more affordable and boosted demand. However, as of Sept 30, 2025, most Tesla models lost eligibility for the $7,500 federal credit (due to hitting certain production volume limits and sourcing requirements) [168]. This led to the Q3 sales rush (as discussed) and now poses a headwind for Q4. The removal of incentives means Tesla has to stand on its own pricing, or find other ways to entice buyers (hence the Standard Range models). Notably, some competitors like GM and Ford still have vehicles that qualify for credits (though they too will phase out over time). In response, some automakers found ways to effectively extend incentives – e.g. by offering lease deals that pass on credits, or lobbying for rule tweaks [169]. Tesla’s strategy was to pre-emptively cut prices so that after credits expired, their cars wouldn’t suddenly seem too expensive. In Europe, EV subsidies have also been dialed back in major markets (Germany reduced EV purchase bonuses, for instance, especially for higher-priced cars – which hurt Tesla more than cheaper local models) [170]. China had a long-running EV subsidy program that ended in 2023, which triggered a price war among EV makers (including Tesla) to keep demand up [171] [172]. The policy backdrop is a bit two-sided: on one hand, global governments are pushing toward electrification (banning gas car sales after 2035 in some regions, emissions credits, etc.), which structurally benefits Tesla as an EV leader. On the other hand, as EVs go mainstream, governments are tapering direct financial support, which means Tesla will increasingly compete on level ground with other makers. Another policy angle: trade and tariffs. Tesla has managed to avoid some tariff issues by building factories locally (cars made in China for China, in Germany for Europe, etc.). But there are still sensitivities – e.g., if U.S.-China relations worsen, tariffs on components or materials could increase costs for Tesla (which uses minerals and battery components from various countries). The EU also launched an inquiry in 2023 into China’s subsidies for its EV industry, potentially leading to tariffs on Chinese-made EVs imported to Europe. If that happens, Tesla’s exports from Shanghai to Europe might be affected. So far, Tesla navigates these by localizing production (its approach is essentially to have a factory on each major continent to sidestep tariffs and shipping costs).

Consumer Income and Fuel Prices: Broader economic factors like inflation and fuel costs also influence Tesla. High inflation in essentials (food, rent) can squeeze consumers, leaving less disposable income to buy new cars. Tesla’s recent move to lower prices is partly recognition that a lot of potential buyers might be stretching their budgets. If inflation continues to moderate and wage growth picks up, that’s positive for auto demand. Gasoline prices are another interesting factor: historically, when gas prices spike, interest in EVs rises (as a cost-saving measure). In 2022, gas prices soared and Tesla had huge waitlists. In 2023–2025, gas has been volatile but generally not at extreme highs. If gas stays moderate or low, the economic incentive to switch to EVs is less urgent for some buyers (EVs still often save money on fuel, but the payback period lengthens when gas is cheap). However, many buy Teslas for performance/tech or environmental reasons, not purely fuel savings. Still, if oil prices jump (due to geopolitical events, etc.), it could give Tesla a demand boost. Conversely, if a recession hits and oil plunges, gas cars become cheaper to run and some cost-sensitive buyers might delay EV purchases. Global economic health matters too: Europe’s economy has been soft (with some countries near recession in 2024–25), which could partly explain Tesla’s sales slump there [173]. China’s economy has had issues (property sector crisis, slower growth) which could affect its rising middle class – a key demographic for Tesla in China [174]. Tesla, being a relatively premium product, needs healthy economies or at least healthy upper-middle-class consumers worldwide.

Tech Sector Sentiment (AI Narrative): Tesla’s stock often trades in tandem with the tech sector, especially anything related to AI. 2023–2024 saw a massive boom in AI-related stocks (Nvidia, etc.) on the promise of generative AI. While Tesla isn’t an AI chip provider, it has positioned itself as an AI-driven company (with autonomous driving, the Dojo supercomputer, etc.). This means at times Tesla benefits from the general “AI hype” – investors lump it in with tech names that could exploit AI advances [175]. If tech stocks are in favor, Tesla often rides that wave; if there’s a tech pullback, Tesla can be dragged down even if its auto business is fine. For instance, if there’s disappointment in the pace of self-driving adoption (say, a competitor has a setback or there’s a regulatory crackdown on AI vehicles), that could cool investor enthusiasm for Tesla’s lofty autonomy promises [176]. On the other hand, wins in tech – like if Tesla demonstrates a big breakthrough in FSD or if Dojo allows some leap in AI training – could further bolster the narrative that Tesla is a cutting-edge AI company, not just a carmaker, and thus deserves a high valuation. Also, stock market liquidity and risk appetite in general matter: when the market is in a “risk-on” mode (often due to macro factors like easing rates or positive growth), high-beta stocks like TSLA tend to outperform. When fear rises (e.g. during banking scares or geopolitical crises), those stocks can swing harder to the downside.

In summary, Tesla’s fate is not only tied to its own execution and innovation, but also to these macro and policy currents. The near-term removal of U.S. tax credits is a challenge that Tesla is trying to meet with pricing adjustments. The potential for lower interest rates is a silver lining that could support its high valuation. Competition, partially spurred by policy (like emissions rules forcing others to go EV), is a constant factor that interacts with macro conditions (e.g. if a rival struggles financially in a downturn, that could slow their EV push, indirectly aiding Tesla). And overarching it all, Tesla’s status as a market darling means it will likely continue to react to broad market sentiment about growth stocks and technology. Investors in Tesla thus keep one eye on Musk’s tweets and delivery numbers, and another on Fed statements and government EV announcements.

Elon Musk’s Influence and Next Moves

It’s impossible to discuss Tesla without considering Elon Musk, the company’s CEO and figurehead. Musk’s influence on Tesla is profound – he’s often described as both Tesla’s greatest asset and a potential liability, depending on the context [177].

On the positive side, Musk is the visionary force driving Tesla’s ambition. He has led Tesla from its startup days (selling a few thousand Roadsters) to a global enterprise delivering nearly 2 million cars a year [178]. His bold vision for a sustainable future – electric cars, solar energy, interplanetary travel (via SpaceX) – has inspired an almost fanatical customer and investor following. This Musk factor has tangible benefits: Tesla spends almost nothing on traditional advertising, yet Musk’s ability to generate buzz (through product unveilings, tweets, media appearances) serves as a constant stream of publicity [179]. For example, the cryptic tweets about the Oct 7 event garnered tens of millions of views on X (Twitter) [180], creating hype that no conventional marketing campaign could match. When Tesla’s stock soared 5% in a day recently, Musk’s personal net worth jumped accordingly, reaching about $465 billion (making him by far the richest person alive) [181]. In late 2025, he even briefly surpassed a $500 billion net worth – the first person ever to do so – thanks to Tesla’s stock rally [182]. Musk’s wealth is essentially tied to Tesla’s success, aligning his interests with shareholders in a big way.

Recognizing Musk’s centrality, Tesla’s board has moved to secure his commitment long-term. In 2025, Tesla proposed a massive new CEO performance award for Musk – potentially granting him ~12% of Tesla’s shares (worth up to $1 trillion) if he meets extremely ambitious targets over the next 10 years [183]. Those targets include Tesla achieving a $10+ trillion market cap and producing 20 million cars per year by around 2035 [184]. For perspective, 20 million cars is more than 10× Tesla’s current annual volume, and $10T market cap would be roughly 5× the combined value of Apple and Saudi Aramco today – truly heroic goals. The logic, as the board sees it, is that Musk responded brilliantly to a similar 2018 incentive plan (which had lower but still huge targets that Tesla met, skyrocketing the stock and earning Musk tens of billions). So, they want to “challenge him to do it again” [185]. Shareholders will have to approve this plan, but it underscores a key point: keeping Musk at Tesla’s helm is considered critical. Musk has a lot on his plate – he also runs SpaceX, he acquired and runs X (Twitter) as of 2022, and has other ventures (Neuralink, The Boring Company). Investors have at times been nervous that Musk might get distracted or even eventually leave Tesla. This new compensation package is designed to keep him focused on Tesla through the coming decade [186] [187].

However, Musk’s influence is a double-edged sword. His unfiltered communication style and forays into controversy can and have had repercussions for Tesla. In recent years, Musk has been very active on social media (X/Twitter), often wading into political and social debates that are unrelated to Tesla’s core business [188]. He has taken stances or made comments about topics like COVID-19 responses, gender pronouns, politics, and more. While some of his followers appreciate his candor, these actions alienated certain groups of consumers – notably more liberal, environmentally conscious people who were once core to Tesla’s early adopter base [189]. Reuters reported that Tesla insiders saw Musk’s polarizing political comments as having “at times hurt Tesla’s brand perception,” particularly among those left-leaning customers [190]. For instance, in 2022–2023 after Musk took over Twitter (and espoused some right-leaning views), there were anecdotal reports of some customers canceling Tesla orders, and competitors like GM even cited Tesla’s brand “baggage” as an opportunity for them. Musk himself has acknowledged that his tweets can be “a distraction” but often insists he won’t “divorce” his public persona from his business – it’s all the same to him. This creates a delicate dynamic: Musk’s celebrity and online presence keep Tesla in the news constantly (mostly for free), but if he veers into highly divisive territory, it can create reputational risks and potentially soften sales in some markets [191] [192]. So far, Tesla’s sales are at record highs, indicating that product appeal wins out over controversy for many buyers, but it’s something both the company and investors monitor closely.

Another concern was Musk’s bandwidth. In late 2022 into 2023, when Musk was consumed with running Twitter (after buying it and making sweeping changes), Tesla’s stock fell sharply, partly on fears that Musk was “AWOL” from Tesla or selling Tesla shares to fund Twitter. By mid-2023, Musk hired a CEO for X (Linda Yaccarino) and publicly stated he’d refocus on Tesla, which helped reassure investors [193]. This episode showed that Musk’s personal actions (even outside Tesla) can materially impact Tesla’s stock – a rare level of key-man risk. It appears Musk has since balanced his time better, but the “Musk overhang” (the risk of him getting distracted or selling shares) is an ongoing consideration.

On the strategy front, Musk’s bold promises both inspire and sometimes frustrate. He often sets extremely aggressive goals – like fully self-driving cars by year X (a moving target he’s pushed out repeatedly), or huge production ramps that end up delayed. Critics argue Musk’s overpromising could land Tesla in hot water – for example, regulators have probed whether Tesla’s marketing of “Full Self-Driving” is misleading since the feature is not actually autonomous yet [194] [195]. There have been investigations and even lawsuits related to accidents involving Autopilot, putting scrutiny on Musk’s claims. Yet, one has to note that Musk’s high-risk, high-reward approach has often paid off in the end. Tesla’s Model 3 ramp in 2017–2018 famously went through “production hell” – Musk set near-impossible production targets, missed deadlines, slept at the factory, but eventually succeeded in mass-producing the Model 3 and effectively transforming Tesla into a mainstream automaker. This pattern of “aim ridiculously high, sometimes fall short initially but eventually achieve something significant” has earned Musk credibility with a lot of investors and fans. It’s why many are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on ambitious projects like robotaxis or humanoid robots – Musk has defied the skeptics before. Still, it also means Tesla’s journey can be bumpy, with delays and flashbacks of chaos that have to be managed.

Importantly, Musk is essentially the face of Tesla. Unlike GM or Toyota, where the average person might not know the CEO’s name, Musk is a celebrity CEO. This personal branding entwines with Tesla’s brand. It gives Tesla a certain edge – customers often feel like they’re part of Musk’s mission when they buy a Tesla – but it also means any misstep by Musk (personal or professional) can directly affect Tesla’s public image. If, hypothetically, Musk had to step away (due to health or other reasons) or shifted focus drastically, it could rattle Tesla’s stock and perhaps the company’s direction. This “key man risk” is something analysts mention – Tesla without Musk is hard to imagine for many, which is why the board’s huge incentive is aimed at keeping him engaged [196] [197].

As for Musk’s next moves: in the near term, he appears laser-focused on Tesla’s product roadmap and expansion. He’s been hyping the upcoming Cybertruck deliveries, the next FSD update, and this recent affordable model launch – indicating he’s very much in Tesla CEO mode right now. The new compensation plan, if approved, also suggests he’s locking in to try to make Tesla not just a trillion-dollar company but potentially the biggest company in the world by far. Musk also continues to push the envelope on Tesla’s culture of innovation – hosting AI Day events, encouraging big engineering bets, etc. One “next move” to watch is how Musk handles the balance between growth and profit. Tesla’s price cuts have dented margins; investors will listen intently if Musk addresses at what point he’s aiming to stabilize prices or if he’s willing to sacrifice short-term profit for longer-term dominance. Additionally, Musk’s influence will likely be critical in navigating regulatory relations – for instance, how Tesla deals with safety regulators on self-driving, or how it participates in policy discussions (Musk has recently engaged more with Washington D.C., attending EV industry meetings and advocating against too much regulatory overreach on self-driving).

In conclusion, Elon Musk remains a central figure in Tesla’s narrative. His vision and leadership have been key to Tesla’s success, and recent actions (teasing new models, aligning a huge personal incentive with Tesla’s future growth) reassure many that he’s all-in on Tesla’s mission at this point [198]. At the same time, Musk’s unpredictability – whether in tweeting or taking on side ventures – injects an element of risk. The company’s challenge (and perhaps advantage) is to harness Musk’s brilliance and charisma, while minimizing the turbulence that sometimes comes with it. As Tesla embarks on the next chapter (mass market cars, AI, expansion in a competitive landscape), Musk’s role will undoubtedly continue to be a major asset, as long as he can balance his audacious goals with effective execution and avoid unnecessary controversies. Tesla’s brand is in many ways Musk’s brand of innovation and audacity. How that brand evolves – staying edgy and exciting but not alienating – will be a key storyline as Tesla drives forward under Musk’s guidance.

Outlook: The Road Ahead for Tesla

As of October 11, 2025, Tesla stands at an important inflection point. The company has immense momentum – record sales, a soaring stock, and new product lines – but also sky-high expectations to live up to. In the coming months, several factors will determine how Tesla’s story unfolds:

Financial Performance: Tesla will report its full Q3 2025 earnings (including profits and margins) and perhaps give hints about Q4. Investors will watch if Tesla’s aggressive pricing hurt its margins or if cost efficiencies (and the energy business boost) helped offset that. Guidance on Q4 deliveries (if provided around Oct 18 or in investor calls) will be crucial. Any indication of a significant post-incentive drop in demand could spook the market, whereas signs that orders remain robust (maybe helped by the new Standard models) would reassure that Tesla can grow even without tax credits. Tesla’s ability to manage costs – through things like cheaper battery designs, simplified manufacturing (single-piece castings, etc.) – will be key to maintaining profitability as they chase volume.

Product Deliveries and Innovation: The much-anticipated Cybertruck launch is slated around late 2025. The success of the Cybertruck’s ramp (can Tesla produce them in volume and with good quality?) will be closely watched. It’s a test of Tesla’s ability to tackle new segments and could open up a new profit stream if truck buyers flock to it – or be a drag if production is too slow or costs too high. Meanwhile, incremental improvements to existing models (like rumored Model 3 “Highland” and Model Y “Juniper” facelifts) can refresh demand. On the innovation front, Full Self-Driving technology progress remains a wild card – a major breakthrough or regulatory approval for robotaxis could massively boost Tesla’s value proposition, while setbacks could reinforce critics’ view that autonomy is always “just around the corner.” Musk’s promise that Tesla vehicles will achieve truly driverless operation has yet to fully materialize; if 2026 is proclaimed (yet again) as the year for robotaxis, investors may react with either excitement or skepticism depending on credibility.

Market Expansion: Tesla is constructing new factories (Mexico is planned to host a next-gen vehicle platform factory). How quickly Tesla can expand capacity and into which markets will influence growth. If Tesla announces concrete plans for an actual $25k car launch (the oft-mentioned “Model 2”), it would be a game-changer for outlook – but also could raise questions about margin impact and cannibalization. Internationally, India has been a market Tesla talks about (Musk met India’s PM about possible investment), and further expansion in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, or Eastern Europe could be on the horizon. Each new market could add sales, but Tesla will face local challengers too.

Competition & EV Industry Health: The competitive landscape will heat up further in 2026–2027 with many new EV models coming. For Tesla’s outlook, a key factor will be how well its competitors execute. If traditional automakers continue to struggle with EV profitability or scaling (as some have in 2025), Tesla can keep gaining share. But if a competitor hits a home run – say, an extremely compelling $30k EV with high range or a superior autonomous system – that could pressure Tesla’s growth or pricing power. Additionally, the overall EV adoption rate matters. We’re at ~15% global new sales being EVs, projected to grow each year. If that growth accelerates (due to climate policies or consumer preference), Tesla benefits as a leader. If it stalls (perhaps due to economic factors or insufficient charging infrastructure in some regions), Tesla’s growth could moderate.

Macro and Policy Environment: As discussed, if interest rates come down in 2026, it could be a tailwind for Tesla’s stock and for auto sales. Conversely, if inflation resurges or a recession hits, Tesla might face a tougher environment of slackening demand. Policy-wise, new government actions like the EU possibly imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs (which could help Tesla’s pricing in Europe) or the US potentially reinstating some incentives (for cheaper EVs or batteries) could influence Tesla’s outlook. Also, environmental regulations like stricter emissions targets effectively force the market toward EVs by mandate, which is a tailwind for Tesla relative to any laggards that still rely on combustion vehicles.

Investor Sentiment and Valuation: Tesla’s current valuation assumes a lot of future success. To maintain a $1.5T+ market cap, Tesla will need to execute nearly flawlessly or spring positive surprises. Any sign of growth significantly slowing (e.g., dropping to single-digit percentage growth without a clear re-acceleration plan) could prompt a valuation reset. On the other hand, Tesla has often surprised to the upside – whether it’s delivering cars faster than expected or opening new revenue streams (like selling software upgrades). Investors will be looking for new revenue streams in coming years: perhaps a launch of a Tesla Network (ride-hailing) if robotaxis become viable, or growth in energy revenue as Megapack factories expand, or even monetizing things like insurance and services better. These could bolster the outlook beyond just car unit sales.

In essence, Tesla’s outlook is bright but challenging. The company sits as the leader of an EV revolution it helped spark, with tailwinds like technological leadership and a strong brand, but it’s now navigating a more crowded highway with many others chasing it. The next year will test Tesla’s ability to keep scaling rapidly while defending profitability – a balancing act that will influence whether TSLA stock continues its upward trajectory or takes a pit stop.

For the public and investors, Tesla remains a captivating story: a company at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and automotive history. The coming quarters will reveal whether Tesla can continue defying odds and justifying the hype, or whether it will face a phase of growing pains as the EV competition catches up. Given its track record, few would want to bet outright against Tesla, but the company certainly has to prove itself anew in this next chapter. In any case, Tesla’s journey ahead promises to be closely watched, full of innovation, and undoubtedly, not a smooth ride – just the way Elon Musk likes it.

China is leading the world in renewable energy. Not only does it generate more of it than any other nation, it is also exporting its clean energy technology to other countries at a furious pace. This week the New York Times published two reports about renewables in China that explain how that country is making all this happen and point out that there are costs to China’s push for renewables that seldom get reported.

162 Square Miles Of Solar Panels

Last month, China President Xi Jinping told the United Nations his country would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its economy and would expand renewable energy sixfold in coming years. The New York Times called it “a moment of global significance for the nation that is currently the world’s biggest polluter.”

China is an enormous country. 90 percent of its people live in the eastern part of the country, where sunshine is muted and winds are normally too slow to power turbines reliably. The western part of China is just the opposite. It has abundant sunshine, wind, and rushing rivers, all of which are ideal for making renewable electricity. But it is a thousand miles or more from China’s densely populated cities. More about that later.

China has made a portion of Tibet into a center for its clean energy plans. In an area that includes mountains and plateaus, it has constructed a 162-square-mile renewable energy development. 10,000 feet high, solar panels stretch from horizon to horizon across an area 7 times larger than Manhattan.

Because the air at that elevation is so clear, those panels are bathed in bright sunshine. Cooler temperatures also help maximize the output from the panels. There are also dozens of wind turbines that spin in the evening breezes just as the sun begins to set. A number of dams on Tibet’s fast flowing rivers add hydropower to the clean energy mix.

The primary group of solar farms, known as the Talatan Solar Park, dwarfs every other cluster of solar farms in the world. It covers 162 square miles in Gonghe County, an alpine desert in the sparsely inhabited Qinghai province in western China. The primary objective for building such massive clean energy facilities is to uncouple China from its dependence on imported fossil fuels — coal, oil, and LNG.

Renewable energy helps China power 30,000 miles of high-speed train routes and its growing fleet of electric cars. At the same time, cheap electricity enables China to manufacture even more solar panels, which dominate global markets and power artificial intelligence data centers, Times reporter Keith Bradsher wrote.

The Talatan solar project provides a massive 16,930 megawatts of power and is still expanding. Within three years, it will grow to be 10 times the size of Manhattan. The wind turbines nearby contribute another 4,700 megawatts of power, and hydroelectric dams nearby contribute another 7,380 megawatts.

To put that into perspective, at the turn of the century, China built the Three Gorges Dam — the largest hydroelectric project in the country’s history. Today, Bradsher reports, it adds enough solar panels to match the output from the Three Gorges Dam every three weeks.

Clean Energy Attracts Industry

Two pumped hydro projects are under construction in the mountains near the Talatan Solar Park. They will use excess solar power generated during the day to pump water up to reservoirs several miles high. At night, the water will flow back downhill to power turbines.

The prospect of inexpensive electricity is attracting new industries to the area. Some will use that electricity to turn quartzite into polysilicon for solar panels. Others want that electricity to power data centers. Those data centers will consume 40 percent less electricity because air conditioning is hardly needed to cool the computers at such high altitudes, where average temperatures are lower than near the coast. Air warmed by the data centers will be circulated through underground pipes to heat other buildings in the area, replacing coal-fired boilers in the process.

China has leveraged smart ideas to address the issue of having too much renewable energy at some times. The pumped hydro facilities will take care of that. They also are taking advantage of nature to reduce the demand for electricity in data centers, while abundant clean energy is being put to good use to manufacture more clean energy resources. If all this sounds too good to be true, perhaps it is.

China & HVDC Transmission

China has massive amounts of clean energy in its western provinces, but only 10 percent of its people live there. The demand for all those lovely electrons is in the coastal areas in the south and east. That is also where much of its industry is located. How does it get the electricity from where it is generated to where it is needed?

It will come as no surprise that China, with its penchant for detailed planning, has considered that problem and come up with a solution. Times reporter Keith Bradsher filed a companion story this week that focuses on the country’s massive network of ultra-high-voltage transmission lines and it reveals that there may be an ugly downside to clean energy miracle taking place in China.

“In China, the longest ultra high voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City,” Bradsher wrote. China has 41 high-voltage DC transmission lines with more in the works.

Many of China’s ultra-high-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries. According to data from the end of last year, the most recent data available publicly, 19 transmission lines operate at 800 kilovolts (800,000 volts). Another 22 operate at 1,000 kilovolts (1 million volts) and one uses 1,100 kilovolts.

That is some serious power. Those transmission lines use massive pylons that march across the landscape like Martian war machines. We don’t hear much about ordinary Chinese citizens complaining about government polities — NIMBY is not much of an issue, in other words. But those power lines have an impact on those who live and work near them.

A million volts overhead can lead to some powerful effects on people and structures nearby. Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, told Bradasher he has concerns about those transmission lines.

“When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.” Oooh, that doesn’t sound good!

The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by. He said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.” That is as close to NIMBY as you are likely to get in China today.

But despite the downsides, there is little question renewable energy has had a powerful impact on life in China. After the disaster at Fukushima in 2011, China abruptly cancelled plans to build more nuclear reactors and transitioned to building up its renewable energy capabilities.

The construction of ultra-high-voltage power lines has helped China reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the toxic air pollution that once blanketed its most industrialized regions. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data in August found that air pollution in China had declined by 41 percent since 2014 — adding almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

The UC Air Quality Life Index says: “Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human life expectancy on the planet. The AQLI’s latest 2023 data reveals that permanently reducing global PM₂.₅ air pollution to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline would add years onto average human life expectancy — or a combined 15.1 billion life years saved. The impact of PM₂.₅ on global life expectancy is comparable to that of smoking, more than 4 times that of high alcohol use, more than 5 times that of transport injuries like car crashes, and more than 6 times that of HIV/AIDS.”

In light of those benefits, a few sparks from your umbrella when it rains might be acceptable. We often speak of renewable energy in terms of how many homes it can power or how many jobs it will add to the local economy. Seldom do we address the benefits of breathing cleaner air. Perhaps renewable energy advocates should emphasize that part to the equation more forcefully.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talatan-Solar-Park.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:49.146987

On June 25, 2024, the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) approved a pilot policy intending to enable data centers to directly procure renewable energy through Direct Power Purchase Agreements (Direct PPAs), facilitated by Third Party Access (TPA) through the national grid for up to 2,000 MW. Please also refer to Hunton’s client alert published back in September 2024 when the Direct PPA and the TPA Code were introduced, the client alert can be accessed here.

The initiative is being jointly implemented by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO), Board of Investment Thailand (BOI), and the governmental utility operators, i.e., the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).

On October 3, 2025, 16 months after the NEPC’s approval of the Direct PPAs pilot policy, the ERC finally released draft regulations on the Direct PPAs (Draft Direct PPA Regulation) and the draft TPA Code. While the release of both drafts represent important steps in market reform in Thailand, our current focus is on the Draft Direct PPA Regulation.

It is important to note that the Draft Direct PPA Regulation and the draft TPA Code are currently in draft forms and remain subject to revision through the public hearing and legislative processes. Stakeholders should be aware that the provisions outlined here may evolve as part of ongoing regulatory consultations.

Purpose and Policy Intent

According to BOI data published on March 17, 2025, between 2022 and 2024, 27 projects in data centers and cloud services applied for investment promotion, representing a combined investment value of over THB 290 billion.

This increase reflects Thailand’s strategic positioning as a regional hub for digital infrastructure and its commitment to enabling large-scale, sustainable operations through regulatory and energy market reforms. In addition, according to Krungsri Bank’s Industry Outlook 2025–2027: Data Center Industry, the total revenue of Thailand’s data center industry is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7.5–8.5%.

With the industry predicting substantial growth, data center operators are scrambling to secure energy at competitive prices, especially renewable energy that will also help them align with various ESG goals. As part of Thailand’s ongoing efforts to support the development of the data center ecosystem in the country, Thailand continues to refine various laws and regulations to align with the country’s strategic objective to position the country as a regional hub for digital infrastructure. Thailand’s policy movements on the energy front not only facilitate individual project development but also contribute to the broader ecosystem necessary for sustainable growth in this sector.

The implementation of the pilot framework is designed to support BOI-promoted data centers in meeting global sustainability mandates by allowing the data centers to sign direct power purchase agreements to quickly procure renewable energy throughout the country. As such, companies producing renewable energy will be able to supply power to data centers via Thailand’s national grid, promoting market liberalization and competition in Thailand’s energy industry.

At a Glance: Contractual Structure for Direct PPA Scheme

The chart below illustrates contractual structure under the Direct PPA scheme as contemplated by the Draft Direct PPA Regulation.

1. Qualification of the Power Producer and Power Plant

Power producers must only use renewable energy sources. Based on our discussion with an ERC officer, a combination of renewable energy sources with battery energy storage system is permissible. The power plant must be a newly established generating facility without any pre-existing PPAs whether with a private offtaker or a governmental utility operator.

Each generating facility must have an installed capacity of at least 1,000 kVA and must have successfully secured a feeder capacity check by the governmental utility operator.

There are no restrictions on foreign ownership; however, foreign investors must ensure compliance with the Thailand’s Land Code, which generally prohibits foreigners (including a foreign majority-owned Thai company) from owning plots of land. However, if a foreign investor receives BOI promotion, land ownership may be permitted if it has been approved by the BOI.

Based on the draft TPA Connection Code, if the installed capacity of the generating facility is at least 6 MW, the generating facility must pass a system study conducted by EGAT.

2. Qualification of the Data Center

The eligible data center must be owned and operated by an entity that:

Receives an investment promotion by the BOI for its data center project (which includes server colocation and data hosting services.

Intends to utilize renewable energy for 100 percent of its power demand.

Is mandated by its group to use renewable energy and to align with its investments in other jurisdictions.

Has a minimum IT base load of 50 MW per building and submits a comprehensive ten-year electricity plan detailing proposed Direct PPAs, grid usage, and total load projections.

Has not yet generated income from such data center project as at the date on which it submits an application to ERC for the Direct PPAs quota.

Has secured a backup supply contract with the relevant governmental utility operator to provide backup supply during off-peak periods or times of excess demand.

Has developed a work plan and obtained a commitment from a power producer to utilize this Direct PPA regime. From our discussion with ERC officers, the commitment could be in the form of a non-binding MOU or LOI, where the relevant power producer expresses intention to sell electricity to the data center through the TPA and a Direct PPA.

3. Other Key Conditions and Compliance

Power producers must comply with both the governmental utility operator’s Grid Code and the TPA Code.

Power producers are required to enter into grid service agreements for the full Direct PPA capacity within specified timelines. If they fail to do so, the data center will be forfeited of any unused Direct PPA quota.

A single data center may be supplied by multiple power producers.

No specific form of Direct PPA is prescribed by the ERC; it is subject to commercial terms and negotiations between the power producers and the data center. A data center may be considered a “large scale customer” and therefore the power purchaser agreements must at least contain provisions related to rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to the ERC Notification on Standards of Contracts on Power Service Provision for Large Power Users B.E. 2561 (2018).

The grid service agreement between the power producer and utility must follow the format provided under the TPA Code.

Implications and Future Prospect

For data centers, it facilitates compliance with global renewable energy mandates while strengthening sustainability credentials.

Renewable energy producers benefit from expanded market opportunities, reducing dependence on government-backed PPAs.

Governmental utilities operators must prepare for the operational demands of wheeling services and system balancing under TPA Code.

An expert at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), a leading policy think tank, notes that clean energy is critical for global trade competitiveness. While the current ERC regulation limits Direct PPAs to data centers, the introduction of the TPA Code creates a pathway for expanding this scheme to other industries aiming for carbon neutrality and Net Zero. This evolution could strengthen Thailand’s export potential and overall competitiveness.

Next Steps

Stakeholders are encouraged to review the Draft Direct PPAs Regulation and TPA Code, and prepare for compliance and implementation.

Among them, photovoltaic panels will receive special treatment due to their high presence in the territory and their particular composition.
In addition, the facility will partially operate with solar energy, using panels on its roofs to self-supply part of its electrical consumption.
Recycling the sun: a new stage for clean energy The rise of solar energy in Chile has left a visible mark.
In the future, the recovery of solar panels could even fuel new production lines of more efficient modules, closing the loop of the solar economy.","In the heart of the Atacama desert, where the sun shines more than 300 days a year, an innovation is being prepared that aims to close the cycle of clean energy. The regional company Amffal announced the construction of the first industrial plant in Chile dedicated to the recycling of solar panels.

This step places the country at the forefront of sustainable management of electronic waste, at a key moment: the imminent entry into force of the Extended Producer Responsibility Law (REP Law), which will require companies to take responsibility for the electrical and electronic devices they place on the market. Among them, photovoltaic panels will receive special treatment due to their high presence in the territory and their particular composition.

Amffal, with more than three decades of experience in environmental management, plans to invest three million dollars in the project. The plant will be located on a two-hectare site in the Atacama Region and is expected to begin operations in 2026. With the capacity to process 345,000 solar modules per year, this infrastructure will mark a milestone in the Chilean circular economy.

In addition, the facility will partially operate with solar energy, using panels on its roofs to self-supply part of its electrical consumption. This model of self-sustainability reinforces Amffal’s commitment to energy transition and the reduction of emissions associated with waste treatment.

Recycling the sun: a new stage for clean energy

The rise of solar energy in Chile has left a visible mark. In the last 15 years, the country has multiplied its photovoltaic capacity, becoming one of the regional leaders in renewable generation. However, with the lifespan of panels estimated between 25 and 30 years, the first installed equipment is already approaching its operational end.

This change poses a new environmental challenge: what to do with the thousands of tons of solar panels that will cease to function? The answer lies in recycling. Each photovoltaic module can recover up to 90% of its components, mainly glass (74%) and aluminum (10%), as well as silicon and copper. These materials can be reintegrated into production chains, reducing the extraction of natural resources.

However, the panels also contain traces of heavy metals, such as cadmium, which require specialized treatment. Therefore, Amffal’s plant will incorporate separation and decontamination systems to avoid environmental impacts and ensure safe handling of all waste.

Beyond waste management, solar panel recycling represents a strategic opportunity. It allows the recovery of valuable raw materials, promotes green jobs, and reduces dependency on metal imports. Additionally, it strengthens public confidence in renewable energy, demonstrating that its development can be truly sustainable from start to finish.

Why and for what purpose are solar panels recycled?

Photovoltaic recycling fulfills three fundamental purposes: environmental, economic, and social. Firstly, it prevents tons of glass, plastic, and metals from ending up in landfills or contaminating the soil. Solar modules, being large and long-lasting products, require complex disposal processes; recycling them significantly reduces their ecological impact.

Secondly, this process allows for the recovery of strategic materials. Recycled silicon, aluminum, and copper retain much of their original quality, which decreases the need for new mining extractions and reduces the energy costs associated with producing virgin raw materials.

Finally, recycling fosters the creation of a sustainable industrial chain, generating local employment in solar regions like Atacama, where much of the country’s energy infrastructure is concentrated. It also contributes to technological innovation, driving the development of more efficient machinery and methods for waste recovery.

In the future, the recovery of solar panels could even fuel new production lines of more efficient modules, closing the loop of the solar economy.

A circular management model from Atacama

Amffal, whose headquarters are located in Copiapó, has built its trajectory by combining innovation with territorial commitment. In addition to the photovoltaic plant, the company is advancing in a pyrolysis facility for end-of-life tires, aimed at converting them into fuels and reusable materials. Both initiatives aim to address critical environmental liabilities in Chile and anticipate the goals of the REP Law.

With a processing capacity of 13,800 tons of solar panels annually, the project not only responds to a regulatory need but also consolidates a cultural shift: moving from a discard economy to a regenerative economy.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/10/reciclaje-solar.jpg.webp,N,,2025-10-11 23:58:57.287276

The Fusion Innovative Research Engine Collaboratives will receive $128 million of the $134 million earmarked for two programs working to advance the sector, Inside Climate News reported.

FIRE comprises seven teams that are creating an ""innovation ecosystem,"" according to a DOE news release. The Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program will receive $6.1 million to support 20 teams in commercializing the clean power source through private-public collaboration.

The DOE could invest another $92 million over four years in the FIRE Collaboratives. The INFUSE projects selected each earned $100,000 to $500,000 for research in materials science, laser technology development, high-temperature superconducting magnet assessment, and artificial intelligence learning for fusion modeling and simulation.

One expert told ICN that the total outlay is not much considering the technical and cost challenges of fusion energy development. The outlet noted that building fission reactors requires complex, time-consuming regulatory and safety steps, and that the process would be similar for fusion reactors.

But it may be decades before the technology is realized. Fusion power mimics what happens in the sun, combining nuclei instead of splitting atoms. The problem is that researchers have been unable to maintain or contain a reaction. The massive amounts of energy it takes to get to that step also make it impractical — for now, at least.

""Nuclear development, ​​whether it's fission or fusion, requires a level of seriousness that I think is just not present in most of these projects right now,"" Edwin Lyman, the aforementioned expert and director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, told ICN.

The potential for nearly limitless clean power, however, has enthralled scientists for decades. Fusion power could usher in an era of resource efficiency, potentially eliminating electricity bills for individuals, businesses, and cities. And because it doesn't produce the long-lasting radioactive waste that fission does, it would be a better choice for the warming world. A planetwide transition from dirty energy sources to renewable energy ones is necessary to reduce the production of heat-trapping gases that harm human health, and the cleaner these alternatives are, the better.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the United States' nuclear power production by 2050, ICN pointed out. It has gone the other way with many other renewable energy projects, including stopping construction of the nearly complete Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and canceling incentives for homeowners to install solar panels earlier than expected.

The Jaguar I-Pace loses 72.2% of its value after five years, making it the fastest depreciating EV. Not only that, but, according to the iSeeCars study, it may lead the industry with the highest depreciation rate overall. No other vehicle included in the study broke the 70% barrier, although the BMW 7 Series was close at 67.1%.

The 2019 Jaguar I-Pace was originally priced from $69,500, which isn’t exactly out of the ordinary for a luxury EV. The 2019 Audi e-tron, for example, started at $74,800. The I-Pace was the cheaper of the two, and it also offered up to a 234-mile range, topping the Audi e-tron’s 204-mile offering.

Unfortunately, Jaguar doesn’t have the best track record when it comes to reliability. Combine that with an EV’s accelerated depreciation, and you’ve got the perfect storm. According to Kelley Blue Book, the fair purchase price of a top-of-the-line 2019 Jaguar I-Pace EV400 First Edition is just $21,617. That model was initially priced at $86,895, which means it is currently worth just 24.9% of its original purchase price.

An EV doomed by the manufacturer

Jaguar was quick to jump into the luxury EV arena, launching the I-Pace in late 2018 for the 2019 model year. While it was rather pricey for all but early adopters, the I-Pace offered an impressive combination of luxury appointments, performance, and range. Fast forward to 2024, and that was no longer the case. Jaguar’s EV hadn’t seen many major updates over those five years, and the brand was getting ready to launch an all-new EV for the 2025 model year.

Naturally, those plans have gone out the window. Jaguar isn’t currently manufacturing any vehicles as it transitions to reestablish itself as an all-electric automaker. Not only that, but maintenance and repairs tend to be on the expensive side.

The Jaguar I-Pace has also been the subject of multiple recalls, most of which concern the risk of battery fires. Per the NHTSA, the first recall took place in May 2023, but the manufacturer can’t quite seem to get it right, as there were five additional recalls through December 2024 covering the same overheating battery issue.

As new competition entered the fray and Jaguar failed to keep up, the I-Pace was quickly overshadowed by competitors that were more luxurious, powerful, and efficient. Just as when they were new, no one seems to want them used, especially not when there’s a pool of used EVs to choose from. Some top competitors include the Maserati Grecale Folgore, Audi SQ6 e-tron, Cadillac Optiq, and Genesis GV60.

Final thoughts

Jaguar was once a highly regarded performance brand, but it has since fallen into a rather desperate state. Plagued by high prices and questionable reliability, the British manufacturer wasn’t doing so hot when it stepped back to rebrand. Hopefully, its time away from production will help the brand find itself and unleash an entirely new slate of performance EVs into the world. Frankly, as much as I like the idea of Jaguar, it’s not a brand I would ever put in my garage in its current state.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/98b237ac294f9b8e75001a660d843f0f,N,,2025-10-11 20:59:11.827701

The announcement signals the automaker's commitment to electrification while also maintaining options for drivers not yet fully ready to switch to electric vehicles.

The expansion comes as the company continues rolling out new electric models, including the subcompact EX30 and mid-size EX90 SUVs introduced over the past year. The XC60 remains one of Volvo's top sellers, with U.S. sales jumping 23 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to last year.

The Swedish automaker is planning to manufacture the next-generation hybrid model at its Ridgeville plant before 2030. Volvo designed the vehicle specifically for American customers, and the company expects it to join the XC60, EX90, and Polestar 3 in the production lineup. The Ridgeville factory is aiming for full utilization of its 150,000-vehicle annual capacity, backed by $1.3 billion in investments and upgrades since 2015.

It's no secret that drivers who choose electric or hybrid vehicles save money on routine maintenance, as EVs eliminate oil changes and many fluid replacements. They also cut down on fuel costs, enjoy quieter rides, and produce no tailpipe emissions. One MIT study found that traditional gas-powered cars create an average of 350 grams of carbon air pollution per mile driven over their lifetimes, while EVs operating on batteries charging from an average U.S. power grid produce only 200 grams per mile.

Charging an EV at home costs less than using public chargers, potentially saving hundreds of dollars annually. Qmerit helps homeowners to install powerful Level 2 EV chargers, providing free, instant installation estimates. Adding solar power into the equation really ups the savings, and EnergySage makes it a cinch to compare quotes from vetted local installers to save up to $10,000 on new solar installations.

Volvo's expanding lineup offers American drivers more choices than ever to reduce their environmental impact without sacrificing premium features and safety standards. Their upcoming hybrid model joins a growing roster of electrified options, giving those in search of their first EV plenty of compelling reasons to make the switch.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Volvo-hybrid-SUVimage-rec1Twgocfw6JsoQ8-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:42.777180

In practical reality, to reinforce its influence, the European Commission has directed its policy focus on promoting sustainable energy development during this last quarter of 2025. Unlocking new business and investment opportunities, including in the areas of manufacturing and agro-processing as well as regional and continental value chain development, forms aspects of raising confidence among a number of African countries.

The European Commission’s report explicitly indicated that this approach mirrors the new strategy and is within the context of geopolitical rivalry and competition. Its policy titled “Global Gateway Strategy” primarily aims at refining the dynamic partnerships and advancing step-by-step for establishing bilateral mutual benefits with Africa. In terms of reciprocity, African leaders and businesspeoplemust explore available possibilities and windows that have been opened, as Europe has unveiled a €300 billion (US$340 billion) alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative—an investment program the bloc claims will create links, not dependencies.

In the latest report, Europe has allocated €618 million for renewable energy projects across Africa, according to the latest reports of the European Commission. The funds are for implementing these projects in eight African countries. In Kenya, the €55 million project is the green energy system to increase generation of and strengthen the power grid. In Uganda, with €60 million, the project will electrify rural areas with a population of over 250,000 people. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, funding is for electrifying the city of Kisangani and the surrounding areas, and in Mauritania, €125 million is allocated for creating a regional energy transport corridor for a rapidly growing population.

In Nigeria, €20 million is for planned technical support and for scaling up renewable solutions, particularly for farmers and small businesses, while in Cape Verde, €39 million is given for the expansion of wind generation and energy storage systems as part of the Cabeolica project. In addition, €30 million is allocated to strengthen the energy system between Zambia and Tanzania, and the largest funding—€199 million—is for Togo, where a renewable energy and energy storage project is implemented in the city of Kpalime.

In an opinion article published by AllAfrica.com, Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has expressed candid views about the economic progress on the continent and the outstanding challenges and the unfolding opportunities there. According to the IMF director, Africa is on a new sustainable growth trajectory. But this transition is costly—at least initially—for a region that already strives to finance other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and as a result, some of these development initiatives must be shared by the international community.

Despite the new challenges, it has become important to strengthen dialogues and focus on the search for more effective financial ways to scale up sustainable development in Africa. The European Commission has to keep in mind and try to incorporate the economic diplomacy with the continent, particularly most aspects of directions that meet the commitments of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and Agenda 2063 of the African Union.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/energy-transition.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 23:00:57.224412

OPAL Fuels, South Jersey Industries, and the Atlantic County Utilities Authority announced last week opening of the Egg Harbor Township facility.

The plant captures landfill gas from ACUA’s solid waste site and processes it into renewable natural gas, offering a lower-carbon alternative to diesel and conventional natural gas.

The facility represents the first project to deliver renewable natural gas into the pipeline system of South Jersey Gas, a subsidiary of South Jersey Industries.

With a capacity to process 2,500 standard cubic feet per minute of landfill gas, the plant is expected to produce more than 650,000 million BTUs annually, which is equivalent to over 4.6 million gasoline gallon equivalents.

“This project reduces emissions, improves local air quality, creates jobs, and strengthens American energy independence,” said Adam Comora, co-chief executive officer of OPAL Fuels in a statement.

The project makes ACUA the first public solid waste facility in New Jersey to host a renewable natural gas operation.

A second project, the Burlington facility in Florence Township, is planned as part of the partnership.

“We said, ‘We’ll take your trash and pay you for it,’” Independence Hydrogen co-founder Bill Lehner told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.
The Independence plant takes hydrogen from Bleachtech, purifies it for fuel cell use and compresses the purified gas so it can be transported to end users.
The Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo has recently invested in Independence Hydrogen, joining Suburban Propane and early-round investors from the Hivers & Strivers group, which invests veterans’ savings in veteran-run firms.
Some $136 million in tax credits through the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program are supporting the Topsøe project.","Joking that his car knows the way to Petersburg, Gov. Glenn Youngkin once again came back to the long-struggling city last Wednesday to highlight a major new economic development project — but unusually for such an event, one that did not involve any state support.

Independence Hydrogen officially opened its first plant in Petersburg, capturing hydrogen that’s otherwise an unused byproduct of Bleachtech LLC’s plant in the southern part of the city.

Bleachtech makes sodium hypochlorite, also called “hypo” or “bleach,” and sells it to water and wastewater treatment plants across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. Until now, it vented hydrogen from the five-story stacks on top of its plant.

“We said, ‘We’ll take your trash and pay you for it,’” Independence Hydrogen co-founder Bill Lehner told the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Youngkin said the hydrogen operation marks a milestone in his “All American, All of the Above” state energy plan, which calls for using natural gas as well as wind and solar generation while pushing for development of small modular reactors and hydrogen as an energy source.

“What’s really exciting is that this project stands on its own economically, and they’re building because this is where they want to be, and this is the opportunity that sits in front of them with a great customer ... like Walmart and a great location, like they’ve got right here,” Youngkin said.

Walmart is the firm’s current main customer, buying the hydrogen for use in fuel cells — basically, devices that bring hydrogen and oxygen molecules together to make water. It is a process that releases electrons when the molecules combine, a process that also releases one of the two oxygen atoms in an oxygen molecule.

But Lehner said Virginia’s main natural gas utilities are also looking at using the firm’s hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas results in a fuel that emits less greenhouse gases, the cause of climate change.

The Independence plant takes hydrogen from Bleachtech, purifies it for fuel cell use and compresses the purified gas so it can be transported to end users. It employs 10 local residents.

The plant can process 1.2 metric tons of hydrogen a day, and do so at a lower cost than the other main ways of obtaining hydrogen, by zapping water with electricity to break apart the one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that form a water molecule or by exposing methane to high-pressure steam to break free its hydrogen atoms, a process that releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.

The Japanese industrial giant Sumitomo has recently invested in Independence Hydrogen, joining Suburban Propane and early-round investors from the Hivers & Strivers group, which invests veterans’ savings in veteran-run firms.

Last year, the Danish chemicals firm Topsøe Holding A/S said it would build a $400 million plant in Chesterfield County that will make a new kind of hydrogen fuel cell, one that the company says can generate clean energy for fossil fuel users like steel mills and shipping companies that cannot simply electrify operations and that generate nearly a third of the world’s greenhouse gases.

The Topsøe plant will employ 150.

Some $136 million in tax credits through the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Energy Project Credit (48C) Program are supporting the Topsøe project.

North Carolina is once again America’s Top State for Business. When businesses look to move and grow in North Carolina they look at our welcoming business climate but a company they also look at our investments — in our people and our infrastructure.

A company is only as good as the people that work for it, and North Carolina boasts a skilled work force. But in order to keep business booming we have to continue to make the lives our citizens and workers better. Right now, people across North Carolina are struggling. Rising costs at the grocery store and energy bills that climbed nearly 6% nationwide last year are impacting us all. With that we have to be proactive and think about the future, not just how North Carolinians can work but how business can work for us. We can’t afford to be complacent.

There’s been a lot of talk about data centers in the news recently and some have argued that new data centers will automatically make energy more expensive for everyday customers. I’ll admit that I have had my hesitations, but I believe that when you hold reputable companies to high standards and even higher commitments, data centers can help stabilize costs and put downward pressure on energy rates.

We’ve seen this work in other states. In Georgia, utility leaders have credited large customers with allowing them to freeze base rates for three years. In Virginia, the world’s largest hub for data centers, billions in annual tax revenue have generated budget surpluses and even property tax cuts for homeowners. And in South Carolina, large facilities are paying higher costs instead of pushing that cost on tens of thousands of households. Oregon passed a law as well creating a new customer category specifically for data centers to assign energy responsibility equitably.

The key is responsibility. Data centers are going to continue to move into North Carolina but it’s important that we put in safe guards to protect North Carolina families, our communities and the environment. Data centers are required to sign long-term contracts, guarantee minimum payments, and cover the infrastructure costs their projects trigger. Many also agree to reduce or shift their power use during peak times, which relieves stress on the grid and helps avoid costly new capacity. Far from pushing bills higher, these steps help spread fixed costs more broadly and fairly.

We also have to address the root drivers of rising energy costs—aging infrastructure, volatile fuel prices, and extreme weather events. Seventy percent of our transmission lines are more than 25 years old. Utilities are being forced to make costly upgrades, and those costs shouldn’t be passed on to consumers. Add in inflationary pressures and billion-dollar damages from hurricanes and wildfires, and it’s no surprise bills are climbing.

It’s no secret that, data centers and artificial intelligence have a large energy demand, but we can take the time now to build new clean energy projects that add supply to the grid. This will also help spread out the fixed costs of running the grid, which means households aren’t carrying those expenses alone. And when new lines or maintenance is needed, it will be the data centers that are required to pay for those upgrades upfront, leaving the grid stronger and more reliable for everyone. That means more investment in energy infrastructure, steadier rates, and a fairer distribution of costs across all customers.

Communities also see direct benefits. Data centers create thousands of good-paying jobs, first in construction and the skilled trades to build the facilities, and then in long-term operations and maintenance once they’re running. And by partnering locally, data centers can help fund community projects, from weatherization upgrades that lower utility bills to resilience hubs that keep schools and community centers open during storms.

Here in North Carolina, the task before us is not to slow growth but to manage it responsibly. That means holding companies accountable for their share of infrastructure costs, prioritizing projects that deliver strong local economic value, and ensuring visible benefits for families – from weatherization upgrades that cut monthly bills to training programs that prepare workers for the clean energy jobs of the future. At the end of the day ensuring that

North Carolina families don’t shoulder the burden of rising energy usage and keep costs down.

North Carolina has the opportunity to show the rest of the country how to do this right: attract transformative investments, protect ratepayers, and strengthen our grid for the long haul. Data centers are not a threat to affordability, but a part of the solution, if we insist on clear rules and fair contributions.

US farmers are facing the quadruple whammy of tariffs, inflation, worker shortages, and climate impacts, leading to a spike in the number of bankruptcies this year. New developments in agricultural science can’t overcome all of those challenges at once, but a new agrivoltaic project in Virginia aims to demonstrate that the new energy crop of the 21st century — solar energy, that is — can help provide a lifeline to farmers and local communities in these challenging times.

Solar Panels And The New Energy Crop Of The 21st Century

Energy crops have been a familiar feature across the modern global agriculture industry for generations, with corn and soybeans currently dominating the production of ethanol and biodiesel here in the US. Although a carbon-recycling sustainability case can be made for biofuels, these traditional, land-based crops are industrial operations requiring herbicides, pesticides, heavy machinery, and transportation to and from refineries before they reach the energy consumer.

The UK consulting firm Cerulogy is among the energy analysts to run the numbers on biofuels and carbon emissions, and their numbers say that biofuels are not a particularly effective alternative to fossil fuels. “Global biofuels production emits 16% more CO2 than the fossil fuels it replaces,” explains the organization Transportation & Environment, citing a new report commissioned from Cerulogy.

“The same land could feed 1.3 billion people, while using just 3% of that land for solar panels would produce the same amount of energy,” T&E adds.

Indeed. Unlike traditional energy crops that involve long periods between harvest cycles, photovoltaic panels capture solar energy from the sun and convert it to electricity with every passing moment of daylight, delivering it directly to energy consumers or to energy storage systems as the case may be.

Small Agrivoltaic Project, Big Impact

The global solar industry could chip away further at Cerulogy’s land use estimate of 3%, by applying agrivoltaic principles that enable farmers to continue using the land in between solar panels.

Agrivoltaics is a new science, emerging on the heels of the initial solar boom of the early 2000s. Back then, the cost of solar equipment was relatively high and developers cut their costs by planting solar panels on beds of low-maintenance sand and gravel, at best seeding the land with monocrops of clover or short grasses. By 2018, though, researchers were compiling ample evidence that the shade from solar panels conserves soil moisture while enabling other shade-tolerant plants and grasses to thrive, opening the door to a powerful new tool in the farmland conservation toolkit. Since then, reducing wildfire risk has also emerged as a follow-on benefit.

To date, most agrivoltaic operations in the US focus on livestock grazing, which also helps reduce maintenance costs by preventing vegetation from overgrowing the panels. Habitat restoration to boost pollinator populations is also beginning to emerge.

Growing crops for human consumption is a next-level challenge, and that’s what the Piedmont Environmental Council in Virginia has set out to tackle. The organization’s pilot project at Roundabout Meadows in Aldie, Virginia, surfaced briefly on the CleanTechnica radar last month, when it earned the title “Plan of the Year” in the 2025 North American Agrivoltaics Awards program. Although the project weighs in at the practically minuscule size of half an acre, NAAA described the forthcoming project as a “deeply strategic installation that could have statewide ripple effects,” with the aim of launching the agrivoltaic field beyond fields for grazing and pollinator habitats, and into the human food crop area.

Agrivoltaics In Action

Activity at the PEC site was well underway by the time NAAA tapped the project for Plan of the Year, with the solar panels up and running along with an onsite energy storage system. Last week, PEC kindly emailed additional details to CleanTechnica in advance of a formal launch to be held on October 17.

The energy storage component may surprise certain high-ranking public officials who doubt that such systems exist, but there it is. “The Roundabout Meadows project will include a smart panel, which enables the farm to measure energy usage, as well as on-site battery storage,” PEC notes. The battery will enable onsite equipment to continue running on solar energy after the sun goes down, including well pumps, refrigerators, and heated greenhouses.

“Intended as a demonstration site and proof-of-concept for multiple applications, we’ve designed the 42-panel solar panel installation with four rows of vegetables directly in the ground to mimic a traditional farm setup,” PEC explains, “And four in raised beds to make the project equally relevant to smaller applications, including urban settings, rooftops, and other built environments.” Wineries, breweries, and parking lots are also on PEC’s radar.

PEC also draws attention to the broader context that supports agrivoltaic solutions for farmers and their communities. “PEC’s agrivoltaics pilot project is also part of a bigger story about agricultural and food system security and clean energy generation, battery storage, and net metering, all in a state facing unprecedented energy demands from data center development.”

15 Agrivoltaic Projects To Rule Them All

If all goes according to plan (and so far, it has), the Roundabout Meadows project will demonstrate that 42 solar panels can co-exist with eight rows of vegetables on a relatively small plot of land. Installed by the firm Tiger Solar, the solar panels are situated in three rows of 14 panels each, placed 12.5 feet apart to allow more sunlight onto the crops. The panels are also mounted on high racks measuring six feet tall, further easing access to the crop rows.

The plantings include lettuces and other vegetables known to thrive in partial shade, along with sun-loving staples like tomatoes and potatoes. The diverse selection will enable the researchers to collect data leading to recommendations for optimal plantings.

In a detailed article about the project last year, PEC described how the agrivoltaic movement has grown into a sprawling knowledge base. To launch the new project, PEC has drawn upon its experience engaging with other projects, solar industry stakeholders, and conservation groups. The new project also taps into Virginia Tech’s agrivoltaic stakeholder group, and it has earned technical assistance from agrivoltaic researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado, through a Clean Energy to Communities grant. Last year, NREL also selected PEC to join a new cohort of 15 organizations conducting next-generation work in the agrivoltaic field.

PEC is already lined up to make a significant contribution to the effort. The project is designed to generate more energy than the farm currently needs, opening up the potential to replace its current stock of fuel-burning tools and equipment with electric ones.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/agrivoltaic-Piedmont-Environmental-Council-.png,N,,2025-10-11 19:02:33.096317

If all you care about is the car itself, the best two-row crossover that Consumer Reports has reviewed is the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y.
Most of the categories on this list include more than one option that Consumer Reports recommends.
If that ""something fancy"" happens to be an electric crossover, then Consumer Reports says you won't do better than the Genesis GV60.
But in Consumer Reports' testing, the GV60 beat them all.","Electric vehicles promise a lower cost of ownership, quick acceleration, quiet rides, and the opportunity for a more spacious cabin that isn't constrained by the limits of a gasoline powertrain. They also offer the opportunity to never visit a gas station ever again. Some enthusiasts may miss having a manual transmission and an actual exhaust note, but for most people, EVs are basically the ideal daily drivers. The only problem is, it can be hard to tell which ones live up to their promises and which ones fall short.

The good news is, our friends over at Consumer Reports recently put together a list of the EVs that performed the best in its testing, while also offering the safety and reliability that you want out of a new car. This isn't just a list of the EVs with the highest overall score, either, since that isn't always super helpful. Instead, they broke the list down into five different categories and made recommendations based on which EV scored the highest in that particular segment. Let's take a look at which vehicles topped Consumer Reports' list in each category.

If you're on the hunt for a good old electric sedan, Consumer Reports says you should skip the Tesla Model 3 and get the Hyundai Ioniq 6 instead. The styling is a little controversial, but the benefit is better aerodynamics, and a more slippery design means better range. Depending on the size of the battery and the configuration you go for, the Ioniq 6 offers between 240 and 361 miles of range, and when you run out of juice, it also offers seriously fast charging.

The Ioniq 6 doesn't have the biggest trunk in the world, and CR didn't love the window and mirror controls, but it's still quick, comfortable and probably more spacious than you might expect based on the design. If you want something with more of a hatchback-like shape, though, CR's second-ranked electric car is the Kia Niro EV. It's front-wheel drive and doesn't quite have the range of a higher-end Ioniq 6 or its fast charging, but as far as practical daily drivers go, the electric Niro is still a compelling, relatively affordable EV.

The BMW 3 Series is one of the best-reviewed gas-powered sport sedans, and the BMW i4 is basically an electric 3 Series with a liftback. As it turns out, that's a recipe for a seriously compelling EV. Some of the controls could take some getting used to, and you may wish the rear seat were larger, but aside from those two, relatively small issues, there really isn't much to complain about with the i4.

It's quick, sporty, offers a nicely put together cabin, the seats are comfortable, and it's also Consumer Reports' top-ranked electric luxury sedan. On the low end, an i4 M50 on 20-inch wheels only gets 227 miles of range, but if you're really concerned about range, there's always the i4 eDrive 40 on 18-inch wheels that gets 318 miles. Either way, you'll get a sporty, fun-to-drive EV that's also incredibly quiet for those times when you aren't carving canyons and just want to relax. If you want more space, though, CR's second-ranked electric luxury sedan is the larger i5, which is more or less, you guessed it, the electric version of the 5 Series.

If all you care about is the car itself, the best two-row crossover that Consumer Reports has reviewed is the recently refreshed Tesla Model Y. It's quick, corners well, offers solid range and can charge on Tesla's Supercharger network, which road trippers will appreciate. That said, the ride and controls still aren't great, there's no support for Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and every dollar you spend on a Tesla helps enrich Elon Musk, who made it his personal mission to destroy the federal government from within.

Those of you who prefer not to enrich a guy who's responsible for babies being born with HIV, Consumer Reports' second-ranked two-row electric crossover is the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is also quick, sporty, and quiet. As far as range is concerned, there's one Mach-E that offers only 240 miles, but if you don't need all-wheel drive, Ford offers a version that's rated at 320 miles.

Most of the categories on this list include more than one option that Consumer Reports recommends. If you're looking for an electric minivan replacement, though, CR says there's only one SUV worth considering: the Kia EV9. EPA range can be as low as 230 miles, but frequent road trippers will probably want the long-range version and its 304 miles of range. You probably won't want to carve canyons in this family hauler, but it's spacious, comfortable and charges pretty fast, which you'll appreciate on a road trip.

In fact, even if you have the budget for a luxury EV, if you want that third row, Consumer Reports says you should still seriously consider the EV9. It might not have the most prestigious badge that you can afford, but in CR's testing, it outperformed the more expensive Mercedes-Benz EQS SUV, Tesla Model X and Rivian R1S. Even if it isn't perfect, that's some seriously high praise for a Kia.

Sometimes you want something a little fancy, and as long as you can afford it, you know what? That's okay. If that ""something fancy"" happens to be an electric crossover, then Consumer Reports says you won't do better than the Genesis GV60. It looks outstanding, and the cabin is just as nice, if not nicer, than you may have been expecting. The styling means some compromises have to be made when it comes to rearward visibility, but it's a lot easier to forgive that when the GV60 looks as good as it does.

The performance version is only rated at 235 miles, but the longest-range version still does a commendable 294 miles. You'll have to give up all-wheel drive if you want to squeeze every mile out of the GV60 that you can, but it's the same story with pretty much every other EV, too. Could you buy from brands with more prestigious badges and longer histories? Sure. But in Consumer Reports' testing, the GV60 beat them all. Plus, you can't forget it also looks great.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-5-best-evs-you-can-buy-in-2025-according-to-consumer-reports/l-intro-1755886944.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:02:15.365039

Auto industry is installing many times more battery capacity than it will need, Reuters review shows

Federal raid at Hyundai’s Georgia plant marked another setback for one of the largest EV projects

STANTON, Tenn., Oct 10 (Reuters) – Stanton, Tennessee – population 450 – welcomed a massive new neighbor a few years ago: a Ford (F.N), electric-truck factory and a joint-venture battery plant slated to employ 6,000 workers.

Ford’s 2022 groundbreaking triggered an influx of construction activity into the former cotton-and-soybean farmlands outside of Memphis. Hard-hatted workers filled local diners. Developers scrambled to build homes and fire stations.

Stanton is quieter these days. Ford over the past 18 months repeatedly delayed phases of the project. The EV truck plant is slated to begin initial production in 2027 and start sending deliveries the next year, a timeline delayed several times from the original plan of coming online in 2025.

Ford said it “will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

The Ford complex is part of the so-called Battery Belt, a swath of factories stretching across the U.S. heartland that spans from Georgia to Indiana. Roughly two dozen battery projects worth tens of billions in investment have been announced this decade, promising to inject tens of thousands of jobs in Republican-dominated states like Georgia and Kentucky.

By last year, though, Americans’ waning enthusiasm for electric cars led automakers to delay or scrap some factory projects. Now, the additional fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent policy changes is descending on the Battery Belt.

Ford CEO Jim Farley last week offered the prediction that electric-car sales could fall by around 50% following the Sept. 30 expiration of a $7,500 tax credit for buyers, echoing other gloomy forecasts for the EV market.

The uncertain fate of these massive, high-tech factories and their employment has rattled the small rural communities that spent years hitching their economic futures to these projects.

Allan Sterbinsky, who retired as mayor of Stanton in December and advocated for the site for years before Ford came to town, said:

That’s on everybody’s mind, quite frankly,

Some residents worry that Ford will never follow through on the plant, the former mayor says. Others hope the company will repurpose the 3,600-acre site if demand doesn’t increase for EVs.

A Ford spokesperson pointed to the automaker’s community work in Stanton, including grants to public safety organizations as part of a broader $9 million commitment to the area.

A Reuters review of U.S. battery-investment plans shows those worries are justified. The industry appears headed toward a huge glut of factory capacity, if all those projects were to move ahead as planned.

By 2030, the planned battery plants would provide the capacity to produce 13 million to 15 million EVs annually, according to figures provided to Reuters by research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. But the industry now might only need about one-quarter of that factory space. S&P Global Mobility predicts only around 3 million EVs will be produced that year, and some would likely use batteries imported from other countries.

Some of that excess roughly 10 million-EV worth of battery capacity would likely be used for hybrids and extended-range EVs as well as the booming energy storage industry, but there is still a sizable gulf, said Stephanie Brinley, S&P Global Mobility automotive analyst.

The demise of the $7,500 tax credit – which had been in place for more than 15 years to persuade Americans to try green cars – is only the highest profile of several anti-EV measures put forth by the Trump administration. Combined, they further jeopardize battery projects and other electric-car-related investments, experts say. In the last few months several automakers have canceled, delayed or downsized EV projects.

Meanwhile, a pot of tens of billions of dollars available to companies that make EV batteries domestically has tighter restrictions that will likely reduce the amount of federal money that flows to the battery sites.

Jennifer Stafeil, tax auto sector lead for KPMG, said:

All of a sudden, much of what was originally going to benefit from these credits now no longer can to a large degree

Trump has said he is not anti-EV, but prefers that consumers decide what cars to buy, without government influence. He also has criticized EV-friendly regulations implemented under former President Joe Biden, which Trump has said were costly and threatened American auto jobs.

One of the nation’s largest EV projects, Hyundai Motor’s $12.6 billion assembly plant and joint-venture battery factory near Savannah, Georgia, is moving ahead. Last month the project suffered a setback when federal law enforcement raided it. Hyundai has said the fallout would delay the battery plant by at least two to three months.

In the three years since Hyundai (005380.KS), announced the megasite, 21 suppliers have opened operations near the site.

A spokesperson said:

Hyundai is committed to offering a diverse product lineup, including internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and EV models.

“We understand that every customer is unique, and we strive to meet a wide range of needs,”

The complex is gearing up to hire 8,500 employees by 2031, and is paying wages 25% above the county average, said Trip Tollison, president of the Savannah Economic Development Authority.

Tollison acknowledged that some in the community worry about the uncertain future of the nascent EV industry that underpins all that development. He is hopeful Hyundai can flexibly shift to hybrid production if the EV market doesn’t take off.

He said:

That’s how you provide opportunities like this to lift people out of poverty,

The Public Service Commission (PSC) authorized a 118 megawatt wind farm in Grant and Iowa counties on September 26, 2025. The decision, according to campaign leaders like Rick Coelho and advocates like Clean Wisconsin, means huge progress on climate change, more renewable energy on the grid, and stronger local economies.

At the same time, regulators approved the 180-megawatt Whitewater Solar Farm, showing the synergy between solar and wind energy. When combined, these actions show that cleaner power can reduce emissions, create jobs, and boost environmental health. The approvals also point to a larger trend: state leaders are viewing renewables as useful tools for long-term resilience instead of just carbon cutters.

What Wisconsin approved—and why it matters

Wisconsin’s first wind farm since 2011 was approved by the PSC and this 118 MW project is located in Grant and Iowa counties, proving that wind development is once again on the rise.

The project can generate leasing money for landowners and farmers while powering tens of thousands of homes, according to Clean Wisconsin.

Renewable energy projects progress when regulations are clear, communities are involved, and environmental objectives are well-defined. And so the state authorized the 180 MW Whitewater Solar Farm, located close to the Jefferson–Walworth county boundary, in the same round of rulings. It makes sense to combine solar and wind energy because solar energy peaks during the day, while wind is typically stronger at night or during different times of year.

According to research by Clean Wisconsin, there are other benefits, like better water quality when solar panels reduce fertilizer from specific crops. Therefore, regulators see these permits as a reaction to climate policy, local economic strength, and environmental health. Initiatives like the Badger Hollow Project, that help the state in gaining knowledge in operations, location, and community benefits, are also part of this environment.

What “energy transition” means for communities

The effects that have on families show up in three simple ways:

Reliable electricity: By incorporating wind and solar energy, Wisconsin’s clean energy supply is improved. These resources work in parallel to reducing reliance on fossil fuels because their peaks happen at different periods. This helps many states achieve their bigger energy transition goals.

Local opportunity. For farmers and landowners, land leases can offer regular revenue, and construction and maintenance create jobs. Communities benefit more when they are involved from the beginning, helping to choose appropriate sites, establishing project guidelines, and communicating the outcomes, according to advocates like Rick Coelho.

Cleaner surroundings: Since renewable energy sources don’t burn fuel, they don’t emit any pollutants while they’re in use either. In order to improve the project execution, regulators are also pushing for bigger and more effective turbines that are made to produce less noise and collect more energy per unit. By linking renewable energy to cleaner lakes and streams, the state also demonstrated possible improvements in water quality with the Whitewater Solar Farm.

A transparent planning and siting process provides a fair approach for developers and communities, making easier the development of the projects.

The road up ahead

Wind and solar energy can power homes, provide income in rural communities, and reduce pollution all at once thanks to the wind projects in Iowa and Grant counties. Wisconsin already has a foundation to grow around, as shown by projects like the Badger Hollow Project. Now that new wind is coming online after years of silence, the state can develop more quickly and wisely.

What comes now? Continue involving communities, monitoring outcomes, refining design, and finding benefits that people can observe.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/wind-farm-Wisconsin.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 18:01:05.781438

I write with respect to our continuing effort to reopen the government, negotiate a bipartisan spending agreement and decisively address the Republican healthcare crisis.

In the coming weeks, hardworking American taxpayers will experience dramatically increased healthcare premiums, copays and deductibles. Tens of millions of Americans will see their insurance payments increase by thousands of dollars per year, in an environment where the cost of living is already too high. That is why we must extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits immediately.

At the same time, Republicans have enacted the largest cut to Medicaid in American history, ripping healthcare away from millions of people. As a result of the Republican healthcare crisis, hospitals, nursing homes and community-based health centers are closing throughout the country. Urgent action is needed now.

Democrats remain ready to reopen the government and pay our troops. We will continue to strongly support federal workers who have been under vicious attack from the Trump administration all year. Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Rubber Stamp Republicans in Congress have pursued a my way or the highway, go-it-alone approach from the very beginning of his presidency. They would rather close the government than continue Affordable Care Act tax credits for working-class Americans and middle-class families.

Equally troublesome, Republicans have completely abdicated their governance responsibility by cancelling votes in the House for a third consecutive week. Instead of voting on legislation to reopen the government, pay our troops and address the Republican healthcare crisis, they remain on vacation.

That is why it is critically important for House Democrats to once again return to Washington to stand up for the healthcare of everyday Americans, pay our active duty troops and support hardworking federal civil servants. On Tuesday, October 14 at 6:00 p.m., we will convene at the Capitol for an in-person House Democratic Caucus meeting to discuss the path forward in connection with the Republican Shutdown and the healthcare crisis they have created. The next day, on Wednesday, October 15, there will be a full slate of work-related activities, including an action on the Capitol Steps, another Caucus meeting, a Steering & Policy hearing on rising healthcare costs, press engagements and our third virtual National Town Hall as we speak directly to the American people.

Thank you for your continued leadership and strength of purpose. I look forward to seeing you back in Washington as we fight to reopen the government, cancel the cuts, lower the cost and save healthcare.

Sincerely,

Hakeem Jeffries

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said: “We are entering the age of renewable abundance and this Global Renewable Summit proves it.
On energy security, energy justice, energy independence, there are so many new elements that have come together to drive lower prices, create simpler technologies and growth through easier to install infrastructure.”","In Short : Global leaders from governments and businesses have pledged to accelerate the transition toward renewable energy abundance. The commitment focuses on expanding clean energy investments, enhancing technology adoption, and strengthening international cooperation. By promoting large-scale deployment of solar, wind, and green hydrogen, the initiative aims to achieve global climate goals and drive sustainable economic growth worldwide.

In Detail : New York, USA – An exceptional group of government leaders, private sector executives, and figureheads from civil society financiers came together today for the High-Level Session on Renewable Energy Abundance, a flagship event of Climate Week NYC and the high-level opening of the Global Renewables Summit.

The event showcased their commitment to accelerating the build-out of zero-emissions infrastructure, driving a transformation that will reshape entire economies and societies. These technologies are already ushering in a new era of global prosperity, innovation, competitiveness, and resilience, while reducing energy costs for businesses and communities.

The leaders discussed the coordinated action needed to raise ambition, set policies to significantly increase renewable capacity, and tackle obstacles that are holding back progress.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen took to the stage alongside leaders such as the Hon President William Ruto of Kenya; the Hon Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas; Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen of Australia; founder and Executive Chairman Andrew Forrest of Fortescue; CEO and Founder Bruce Douglas of the Global Renewables Alliance; and Chair of the Board Mike Rann of Climate Group.

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said: “The energy transition has truly taken off. In 2024, almost two trillion dollars were invested worldwide in clean energy, and for every euro dollar spent on fossil fuels, more than two went into clean energy. And the economic case is clear. The momentum is real. But we all know that momentum alone is not enough. We need action. So to usher in a true age of renewable abundance with clean, affordable energy for all, we must act decisively. We must act as governments and industry, and we must act together, across borders, across continents. Clean energy is not only about addressing climate change. It is, in my view, also about energy security and about prosperity.

So my message to the CEOs and investors that are here today, is please tell us what you need, what guarantees, what risk sharing tools, or what is the regulatory conducive environment that you need, that we can provide that will allow you to invest at scale where it matters most. And what must governments do to help you deliver. In return, of course, we ask you to put your capital, your technologies, your innovation to work in the regions where it will have the greatest impact, so that together, we deliver on net zero, strengthen energy security, and that together we drive prosperity.”

The high-level session, organised by Climate Group, Fortescue and the Global Renewables Alliance, took place at a critical time for the global energy transition; just two days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, where many countries are expected to announce their NDCs (national climate action plans).

Hon Prime Minister Philip Davis of of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas said: “We need to be the most passionate and effective evangelists for the proposition that energy reforms will expand our possibilities, not limit them. We need decision makers everywhere to understand that replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not come at the expense of prosperity, but is a prerequisite for future prosperity. We will never unlock the full potential of clean energy abundance if the stories we tell focus on scarcity and sacrifice. Instead, let’s do a better job at painting a vivid picture for our citizens of a future in which clean energy generates prosperity that is broadly shared.

We know the work of energy reform is complex, expensive and at times overwhelming. Yet we also know that every panel installed, every regulation modernized, every grid, moves us closer to a world where energy abundance is real. The point is not perfection. The point is progress, and the belief that by working together, each step we take strengthens the chance of success for us all.”

The leaders discussed how the global economy is moving from an era of energy constraints to one defined by energy possibilities, and how renewable energy and electrification are becoming the bedrock of future prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness. They delved deep into the need to work towards a future in which energy security, affordability, and sustainability reinforce one another, creating widespread social and economic benefits.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said: “We are entering the age of renewable abundance and this Global Renewable Summit proves it. Renewables now lead the way in new power generation, with investments growing 14% annually since 2018, despite pandemics, inflation, and geopolitical shocks. But the story is incomplete: emerging markets and developing economies, representing a third of global GDP, still capture less than 10% of energy transition finance. As we head toward COP30 and deliver on the UAE Consensus mandate to triple renewables by 2030, we must put equity and impact at the heart of this transition.”

For families and communities, this will mean lower energy costs, enhanced energy security, and new economic opportunities. For industry, it will mean an unprecedented chance to scale innovation — from artificial intelligence to advanced manufacturing — powered by near-limitless clean energy.

Bruce Douglas, CEO of the Global Renewables Alliance underlined: “The path is clear: phasing out volatile fossil fuels whilst delivering renewable energy abundance is how we create prosperity, stability and real energy security. However – if we want to build the clean, resilient and competitive energy system of the future – we must all stand up, come together and act now.”

Ambassador André Correa do Lago, President-Designate, COP30 said: “The association of renewables with other agendas is a very important step forward. On energy security, energy justice, energy independence, there are so many new elements that have come together to drive lower prices, create simpler technologies and growth through easier to install infrastructure.”",https://www.eqmagpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/International-Renewable-Energy-Agency_IRENA-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 16:02:22.188070

Governments want EVs. Automakers are racing to deliver them. But for car enthusiasts, this all-electric rush isn’t just about saving the planet—it’s reshaping the hobby we love. And not in a good way.

The EV Mandate: Killing ICE Icons

Automakers are dumping R&D money into EVs to meet global emissions rules, and guess what’s getting cut?

Manual transmissions are disappearing almost completely.

Affordable sports cars like the Camaro and Challenger are gone.

Even long-running models like the Mustang and Porsche 911 face uncertain futures beyond the next decade.

And the few ICE performance cars still around? They’re more expensive than ever because they’re being treated like “last hurrah” halo products.

EVs Aren’t Cheaper—For Anyone

Enthusiasts were told EVs would make performance accessible, but the reality is brutal:

The average new EV price in 2025? Nearly $54,000.

Lightweight, affordable sports EVs basically don’t exist yet—everything’s a heavy crossover or a 1,000-horsepower hyper-sedan.

Battery replacement costs still scare off buyers, especially for cars meant to be driven hard.

EV Performance is Impressive… But Soulless

Yes, Teslas and Rimacs are blisteringly fast. But enthusiasts aren’t just here for 0-60 times. We want:

Manual gear changes.

Exhaust crackles and engine character.

Lightweight cars with personality—not 5,000-lb torque monsters.

As great as EV acceleration is, many enthusiasts describe it as “video-game fast”—instant, efficient, but emotionally flat.

Who’s Still Fighting for Us?

All is not lost. Some automakers are still throwing us a bone:

Toyota & Lexus – Developing synthetic fuels and keeping manual transmissions alive in GR models.

Porsche – Promising to preserve ICE 911s as long as possible.

Dodge – Experimenting with “eMuscle” that mimics V8 sound (cringe? maybe… but at least they’re trying).

And synthetic fuels, hybrids, and biofuels could extend the life of enthusiast cars well past the EV deadline.

The EV push was supposed to move us forward. But for enthusiasts, it feels like we’re being shoved into an expensive, characterless future while our favorite ICE cars die off early. The good news?

The Indian government has recently announced that it has installed 44 GW of module capacity during the first half of 2025. A report from Mercom has stated that India’s solar manufacturing sector has seen significant growth in H1 2025, which underscores the nation’s efforts to increase the capacity in the market.

Mercom Capital Group reports an increase in solar manufacturing in India

For a nation with the exceedingly large population that India has, fostering renewable energy is needed to deliver acceptable electricity levels to the grid, while keeping the non-renewable energy sector relatively productive.

In a move that is unprecedented for India, solar imports declined while exports saw a significant increase during the first half of 2025. A new Mercom India Research report states that PV module production capacity is rising by 44.2 GW and cell capacity by 7.5 GW.

The total capacity listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-I and List-II has now reached 109.5 GW for modules and nearly 17.9 GW for cells, respectively.

According to Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu, despite the huge PV production capacity, actual operational capacities can be 30% to 40% lower. Mr Prabhu believes that ALMM-certified capacities deliver a more accurate reflection of supply, even though wattage breakdown is not specified.

As of June of this year, there were 91.5 GW of module manufacturing capacity across various technologies and wattages with ALMM certification, and 13.5 GW of cell capacity was listed under ALMM List-II out of all installed cell production capacity.

“New module lines typically take several months to stabilize before reaching full utilization, while smaller facilities continue to operate at lower levels, constrained by outdated technologies, lack of scale, and lower wattage modules that are no longer in demand. This has led to fewer orders and accelerated consolidation with only larger manufacturers that possess scale, efficiency and credibility remaining competitive” – Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu

Donald Trump’s tariffs have affected the export of Indian made solar capacity

The world became aware of Donald Trump’s plans to implement tariffs on a variety of nations when he began his second term. On day one, he stated that the United States would implement tariffs on India, which has now affected the solar manufacturing sector.

During the reporting period of the Mecom report, India imported 44.6 GW of solar modules and cells, with the former accounting for 34% and the latter 66%, which underscores the progress being made by India in the sector.

“Exports have also been hit hard. Shipments to the United States, which accounted for more than 95% of Indian module exports, have come to a halt after the recent 50 tariff.” – Mercom Capital Group CEO Raj Prabhu

As the United States will continue to rely on solar and storage capacity in its nation, India will need to consider its next move to alleviate the pressure on the solar manufacturing sector.

Now, a logistical crisis looms on the horizon.

Equinor’s Empire Wind is a 810-megawatt project being built about 20 miles off the shore of Long Island, promising enough energy to power 500,000 homes once completed in 2027. The Trump administration halted construction in April, but allowed it to resume in May. The latest challenge came on Thursday with the unexpected cancellation of a contract for the massive new wind-turbine installation vessel that Equinor had been planning to use on the project next year.

Two shipbuilding companies broke out into a public skirmish — one unexpectedly cancelling a contract and the other threatening legal action — over the construction of the specialized ship. The fate of the vessel, which is already more than 98% complete and floating in Singapore’s waters, is now uncertain.

The cancelled $475 million agreement leaves Equinor scrambling to figure out how to maintain progress and bring Empire Wind online on schedule.

“We have been informed by Maersk of an issue concerning its contract with Seatrium related to the wind turbine installation vessel originally contracted by Empire Offshore Wind LLC for use in 2026,” said an Equinor spokesperson via email. ​“We are currently assessing the implications of this issue and evaluating available options.”

Only a handful of vessels in the world are capable of lifting, carrying, and piecing together the massive steel components of offshore turbines.

Thursday’s news highlights the complexity of bringing just one U.S. offshore wind farm over the finish line, given the combination of logistical difficulties and political obstacles put up by the Trump administration.

In an email to Canary Media, Maersk Offshore Wind spokesperson Caroline Knox confirmed that the company terminated its building contract with Seatrium ​“due to delays and related construction issues.” Knox declined to comment further.

Seatrium told Reuters it was evaluating its options for the vessel, including via ongoing talks with Empire Wind, and considering legal action.

Singapore-based Seatrium is fresh off the monumental achievement of berthing a first-of-its-kind offshore-wind installation vessel in U.S. waters. In September, the company delivered the $715 million Charybdis from its Brownsville, Texas, shipyard to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia. The American-made vessel is owned by utility Dominion Energy, which immediately put it to work building the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. The ship’s smooth delivery is a major reason why the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind farm is progressing fast enough to have a new March 2026 launch date.

The ship’s hull is 472 feet long and 184 feet wide, making it one of the biggest vessels of its kind in the world. And, more importantly, it was built to serve the entire U.S. sector — not just Dominion Energy’s project. In other words, the Charybdis could be a solution to Equinor’s new problem.

“Upon the completion of its charter with [Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind], the versatile Charybdis will be available to support a variety of projects, including offshore wind and other critical heavy lift shoreline projects, such as salvage operations or other energy projects,” said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion Energy representative, in an email to Canary Media.

An Equinor spokesperson provided no comment about Charybdis but reiterated that the company is exploring all options.

Albemarle Lithium Mine in 2025: An Overview

Albemarle Corporation stands at the center stage of the evolving landscape of lithium mining in 2025. With its pivotal mining operations based in the Lithium Triangle of South America—which includes Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia—Albemarle plays a critical role in the global lithium supply chain. This region hosts some of the world’s richest brine deposits of this essential mineral, and Albemarle’s optimized mining techniques focus on responsible extraction with minimal environmental disruption.

The company’s emphasis on reduced water usage, careful monitoring, and strategic investments in research and development underline its commitment to sustainability. The impact of Albemarle’s lithium mining operations extends beyond powering electric vehicles; it signals a broader shift toward eco-friendly innovation in agriculture, infrastructure, defense, and the global resource economy. In 2025, this shift is more apparent—and more crucial—than ever before.

The Strategic Importance of Albemarle and Global Lithium Supply

As the demand for lithium intensifies worldwide, Albemarle has firmly established itself as a pivotal player in the global lithium market. The corporation’s mining activities not only meet the rising needs of the battery manufacturing sector but also serve as the backbone for a wide range of infrastructure, agricultural and defense systems. The strategic importance of lithium as a critical mineral cannot be overstated.

Energy Storage and Electric Vehicles: Lithium is essential for high-capacity batteries that power electric vehicles, stabilize renewable energy grids, and store energy for remote infrastructure applications.

Agricultural Advancements: Lithium-based compounds are increasingly integral to developing advanced fertilizers, water retention additives, and plant growth enhancers for sustainable farming.

Defense: Modern defense technology’s rapid evolution—for unmanned aerial vehicles, mobile command systems, and secure communications—relies on Albemarle’s consistent and high-purity lithium supply.

The global resource extraction industry, as represented by Albemarle, is therefore central to technological advancement and sustainable development efforts across sectors. In 2025, government initiatives, private partnerships, and industrial transformations actively underscore the critical role of responsible lithium production.

Mining Operations in the Lithium Triangle: Environmental Impact & Optimized Techniques

The Heart of Lithium Mining: Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia

At the heart of Albemarle’s mining operations lies its lithium mine located in the South American Lithium Triangle. This area—encompassing Argentina’s Salar de Atacama (Chile), Salar de Uyuni (Bolivia), and parts of northwest Argentina—hosts the world’s largest and richest lithium brine deposits.

Brine Extraction: Albemarle’s process involves pumping lithium-rich brine from subsurface aquifers and utilizing solar evaporation techniques. The resulting concentrate is further processed to extract lithium compounds (such as lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide) required by various industries.

Water Management: The efficiency and environmental sustainability of these operations are closely monitored, as excessive brine extraction can threaten local ecosystems and agriculture by lowering water tables, especially in arid regions.

Technological Innovations: Albemarle is investing in next-generation extraction techniques—sustainably optimized to minimize land and water disruption and improve yield per unit of water withdrawn.

Through these optimized techniques and a continuous focus on reducing water usage, Albemarle manages to sustainably extract lithium with minimal disruption to surrounding land and water bodies. The company’s efforts also include environmental monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and robust compliance programs to maintain the long-term viability of both the mine and local agricultural interests.

The nations in attendance were some of the biggest economies in the world, which laid out their nationally determined contributions. The world has become acutely aware that the need to adopt renewable energy has become as urgent as ever, and several countries, like China, have taken significant steps towards reaching their lofty ambitions of decarbonization.

The nations of the world are working hard to meet the goals set out by the Paris Agreement

When the nations of the world came together in Paris to discuss and make commitments to the global decarbonization efforts, the meeting was hailed as an epitome of global cooperation. Throughout history, rarely have the biggest nations of the world come together to agree on anything, let alone something as divisive as the climate.

However, in an unprecedented move, the nations of the world laid out their countries ‘ commitments to reaching the decarbonization goals. While every nation in attendance at the event in New York has taken significant steps to reduce its emissions, China has done more than any other nation.

Of the nations shown attended, the majority outlined their nationally determined contributions, while those who did not are expected to do so in the coming weeks before the leaders meet in Belem, Brazil, for the 30th meeting of the U.N. Conference of the Parties (COP30). Among the nations that have already expressed their NDCs are:

China

The European Union

Peru

Türkiye

several small island states

Several nations have already expressed their NDCs before the event, while some are yet to release theirs, but are expected to do so in the near future.

While progress has been made, more needs to be done to reach the global decarbonization goals

The NDCs already expressed are commendable, but praise will only get you so far before more tangible action is required. Every nation can claim they are doing its best to reach its emission goals, but a lack of investments and slow adoption of the renewable energy sector has led to many pointing out that the pace of transformation is not fast enough.

“It is hopeful, but not fast enough, nor at the scale needed. Good direction of travel notwithstanding, this is not enough action to avert the worst impacts climate change will visit upon the people of this planet. Countries need to keep turning these promises into clear action at home.” – Manish Bapna, president and CEO of NRDC

China has emerged as a leader in the global community regarding actual steps taken by the government in reducing the reliance on fossil fuels. Europe has seen robust demand for renewable energy capacity, but more needs to be done to adopt the technology.

China has outlined its ambitions during President Xi’s speech to the assembly. He highlighted several measures the Chinese have taken, which include bringing the total installed wind and solar capacity to 3,600 gigawatts, among others.

It is a curious twist of fate that Scotland’s oil and gas reserves are declining just as climate change creates a need to move towards low-carbon sources of energy. And it is a hugely serendipitous one that Scotland is so well placed to become a global leader in renewable energy.

However, a new report by Future Economy Scotland spells out just how poorly this country has been capitalising on its good fortune. For, while 18,000 direct and indirect jobs in oil and gas have been lost since 2014, only 6,000 have been created in clean energy.

Juan-Pedro Castro, an economist at the think tank, said: “The North Sea is a maturing basin – reserves are running out, and extraction is increasingly uneconomic. While critics like to blame net zero for the industry’s decline, the reality has more to do with geology and economics. Like it or not, Scotland must now prepare for life beyond fossil fuels.”

Missed opportunities will be snapped up

The report warns oil and gas jobs could decline by anything from 20 per cent to a staggering 50 per cent by 2030. If correct, this is the kind of situation that should be regarded as close to a national emergency.

The Scottish and UK governments should be urgently working with both each other and the energy industry to find ways to ensure the loss of oil jobs is slowed and the growth of green energy jobs is dramatically increased. If the overall rate of decline across both sectors continues, the wider economic consequences will be severe, particularly for the North East, and overseas competitors will snap up our missed opportunities.

There has been much talk about a ‘just transition’ for oil and gas workers, so that they can move to well-paid jobs in renewables and avoid the fate of 1980s coal miners. But all too often it has been ‘just talk’.

The research said total employment supported by North Sea oil and gas had fallen by a third (32 per cent) since 2014, amounting to 34,000 job losses.

The findings come as a Chinese company piles pressure on the UK government to approving its controversial plans for a massive wind turbine factory in Scotland.

Ming Yang unveiled details of its proposals for a project earmarked for Ardersier port in the Highlands, which would involve investment of up to £1.5 billion and create as many as 1,500 jobs.

But the UK government has not yet given the company permission to move ahead with the plans and a source told The Scotsman ministers would not be “rushed into anything when there are several factors, including national security, to consider”.

FES said just 6,000 new direct and supply chain jobs in clean energy have been created since 2014, compared to 18,000 equivalent oil and gas jobs lost.

And forecasts show oil and gas jobs could decline by another 20 to 50 per cent by 2030, threatening tens of thousands more roles, the think-tank said.

The new report calls for pro-active policy decisions to ""fully seize the economic opportunities offered by decarbonisation"". It argues the energy transition could create up to 40,000 more jobs than will be lost by 2030 if decisive action is taken.

The report is published today as the SNP gathers in Aberdeen for the party's annual conference.

""Our research shows that, with the right ambition and policy support, the net zero transition can create more energy jobs than will be lost. But to make that happen, we need far more pro-active policies to create green jobs, retrain workers, and guarantee a just transition for the workers and communities.”

The report recommends the Scottish Government develops a clear transition roadmap while implementing an ambitious green industrial strategy.

It also calls for expanded retraining programmes and a boost to college funding, as well as improved pay and conditions in green sectors.

Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Douglas Lumsden said: “This grim report exposes the devastating impact on jobs in the oil and gas sector due to the SNP and Labour’s hostility towards it.

“Everyone wants action on an energy transition, but reckless policies from the UK and Scottish governments mean a demolition of the oil and gas industry is happening at a rapid pace.

“While we still rely on oil and gas, it’s just common sense we should be producing it here in Scotland.”

He added: “Our oil and gas sector stands at a cliff-edge, but the Scottish Conservatives will continue to fight their corner and demand an affordable transition that protects jobs and brings down bills for consumers.”

A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “Renewable energy is already boosting Scotland’s economy and will provide many more jobs for the communities across the country as well as wider infrastructure benefits.

“We are also very clear in our support for a just transition for Scotland’s valued oil and gas sector, recognising the maturity of the North Sea basin and in line with our climate change commitments and energy security.

“Workers are at the heart of the transition, and we are supporting them with the powers available to us. Through initiatives such as the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, we have already invested £120 million to support the North East’s transition to net zero helping to create green jobs, support innovation and secure the highly skilled workforce of the future.”

Under the first of three phases, Ming Yang said it would invest up to £750 million in an advanced manufacturing facility – with the first production taking place by late 2028.

Latter phases would see the facility expand and create an “offshore wind industry ecosystem” around the hub.

Ming Yang announced its plans on Friday following discussions with the Scottish and UK governments over the past two years, and just days after a huge global investment summit in Edinburgh attended by Ming Yang UK chief executive Aman Wang.

The company has been waiting since the spring for UK government approval for them to enter the British renewables supply chain, amid national security concerns.

Ming Yang signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government in 2021 but has not yet received permission to proceed.

A UK government source told The Scotsman the company “seems to be trying to pre-empt us”, adding that “we’re not being rushed into anything when there are several factors, including national security, to consider”.

Ming Yang is the only company that can produce floating wind turbines for the European market, with 60 per cent of the ScotWind contract for floating wind - making up around 15GW of energy.

First Minister John Swinney has previously said that floating offshore wind is “central to my vision for Scotland’s future as a modern and dynamic nation”.

Ardersier, near Inverness, is one of the “green freeport” initiatives which offer tax and customs incentives to encourage investment.

Last month Ming Yang and Octopus Energy announced they would be in partnership to develop new wind projects.

Zhang Chuanwei, founder and chairman of the Ming Yang group, said: We are excited by the prospect of investing in the UK and look forward to finalising our investment decision.”

Mr Wang said: “We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.

“We fully support the Government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower, and I’m confident that once the plans are approved we can make a valued contribution to this goal.”

A UK government spokesperson said: “This is one of a number of companies that wants to invest in the UK. Any decisions made will be consistent with our national security.”

I’m a long-term investor focused on U.S. and European equities, with a dual emphasis on undervalued growth stocks and high-quality dividend growers. Through years of experience, I’ve learned that sustained profitability—evident in strong margins, stable and expanding free cash flow, and high returns on invested capital—is a more reliable driver of returns than valuation alone. I manage one of my portfolios publicly on eToro, where I qualified as a Popular Investor, allowing others to copy my real-time investment decisions. My background spans Economics, Classical Philology, Philosophy and Theology. This interdisciplinary foundation sharpens both my quantitative analysis and my ability to interpret market narratives through a broader, long-term lens. I started investing when I became a father. By managing wisely what I received and earn, I aim to ensure for me and my children that we don't have so much that we don't have to do anything, but that we have enough assets to be free to do what we want.

On September 12, 2025, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") proposed to effectively put an end to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (""GHGRP""), which currently requires certain industrial facilities in the U.S. to measure and report greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions to EPA (the ""Proposal""). The proposal would remove reporting obligations for all but one source category in the current rule (petroleum and natural gas systems). This alert explains the Proposal and comments on its potential effect on certain affected industries.

Background

The Clean Air Act (""CAA""), the main federal law in the United States that governs air pollution,1 sets out a comprehensive regulatory framework administered largely by EPA but implemented in partnership with state governments to improve air quality and regulate sources of air pollution. The CAA was first enacted in 1970 and received its last significant overhaul in 1990. The CAA did not expressly provide EPA with the authority to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide or other GHGs, but Congress and the EPA have still tried to use it to that end.

EPA created the GHGRP in 2009.2 The GHGRP requires large GHG emitters to monitor and report their annual GHG emissions to EPA, and thus functions as an information-collection and transparency program. According to the Proposal, approximately 8,200 facilities, suppliers, and CO2 injection sites submit annual data under the GHGRP. Over time, EPA has expanded the GHGRP to cover 47 different industries, ranging from petroleum and natural gas systems to landfills and manure management facilities. EPA estimates that compliance with the program costs affected industries $303 million annually ($256 million of which is incurred by companies in the petroleum and natural gas industries).

EPA issued the rule under Section 114 of the Clean Air Act. Section 114 states (in relevant part) that the EPA Administrator may require owners or operators of emissions sources, equipment manufacturers, or others subject to the CAA to make reports to the EPA for the purpose of (i) developing implementation plans, standards, and regulations, (ii) determining whether any person is in violation of such plans and standards, or (iii) carrying out any provision of the CAA other than a provision of Title II (relating to motor vehicle emissions).

The Proposal

The Proposal seeks to completely eliminate reporting obligations for 46 of the 47 industries required to report under the GHGRP (referred to as source categories). The Proposal does not remove those obligations for most petroleum and natural gas systems, as the data collected from those systems under the GHGRP are necessary to calculate the waste emissions charge enacted in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. However, because the collection of the waste emissions charge was postponed until 2034 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Proposal suspends the reporting requirements for affected systems until that time.

The Proposal points back to the express terms of Section 114 of the CAA as the legal basis for the repeal of the GHGRP. As previously discussed, Section 114 authorizes EPA to require regulated entities to submit information necessary for EPA to carry out certain responsibilities under the CAA. In the Proposal, EPA asserts that its authority under Section 114 is not unlimited, and that the agency must show that any information it requires is relevant to EPA's actions or obligations under the CAA. The Proposal points out that data collected under the GHGRP (from 47 source categories over more than 10 years) has rarely been used by EPA to inform new source performance standards. Moreover, the Proposal expressly states that EPA is not planning to develop any such regulations at this time. The Proposal therefore concludes that EPA lacks authority to continue to collect GHGRP data under Section 114 because the reporting requirements do not serve any underlying statutory purpose.

Alternatively, the Proposal characterizes the GHGRP as discretionary under Section 114, since the statute says that EPA ""may"" collect information. Current EPA leadership thus argues that it can simply terminate the GHGRP on the grounds that the Administrator no longer considers the information necessary to carry out the requirements of the CAA. The Proposal states that, if information submitted under the Program is needed for any purpose, the Administrator could simply issue a new information request under Section 114, as done for other purposes under the CAA.

What does the Proposal mean for companies?

The practical effect of the repeal of the GHGRP is expected to be fairly limited for most industries. The Proposal notes that $256 million of the total $303 million annual cost of the program are concentrated in the petroleum and natural gas industries. For all other industries subject to the program, the total annual cost of the program is only approximately $50 million. When that figure is spread across all of the companies required to report, the total annual cost of the program appears to be fairly modest for most of the regulated industries.

Arguably, larger companies are less likely to be affected by the Proposal. Those companies often collect and disclose GHG emissions data for reasons unrelated to U.S. federal law. For example, those companies may have foreign legal obligations, internal and/or publicly-stated ESG commitments, and buyer/supplier demands for greener products that require them to calculate and report their GHG emissions on a regular basis. Thus, we do not expect many larger companies to cease tracking and reporting of GHGs based solely on the Proposal. Some smaller and domestic entities, however, such as municipal landfills and wastewater treatment plants, have fewer competing obligations. Those entities may therefore see some practical benefit from no longer having to collect and report GHG emissions data to EPA.

The Proposal also notes that some 20 U.S. states implement state-level greenhouse gas reporting that either incorporates 40 CFR Part 98 by reference or relies on data collected under the GHGRP. Facilities in those states may continue to have an obligation to collect and report their data to state regulators. The administration's proposal to repeal federal data collection requirements may also spur additional states to pass their own programs that apply within their borders.

Since the data collected by the GHGRP is used for a variety of purposes, we also expect to see some impacts on other federal regulatory programs. The Proposal notes that the data is used to inform the phase down of hydrofluorocarbons under the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, and in the implementation of federal tax credits for carbon dioxide sequestration (45Q) and clean hydrogen production (45V). EPA acknowledges that the data collected by the GHGRP is important for those programs, but argues that those benefits are not required to carry out the Agency's functions under the CAA, and should be collected in different, more efficient ways. If the Proposal goes through, we would anticipate further regulatory action will be required by EPA, the Treasury Department and some state governments to implement new reporting specific to those programs.

Repeal of the reporting requirements would also lead to the loss of detailed information about GHG emissions in the United States beyond 2024. That information is currently collected by the Electronic Greenhouse Gas Reporting Tool (e-GGRT) and made available to the public through the Envirofacts and Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool (""FLIGHT""). The Proposal states that EPA does not intend to ""maintain the electronic functionality of the information collection system"" after repeal, so it is unclear whether the GHG data in those systems will remain available. That information is widely used by researchers and policymakers to track, inform, and evaluate policy regarding GHG emissions. While that information can be collected through other means, the loss of that information may impact policy making in the future.

Broader context

The Trump administration has not hidden its skepticism about climate change and the risk it poses to human health and the environment. In July 2025 the Department of Energy (""DOE"") issued a report titled ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate."" According to the DOE's website, one of the key findings of the report is that ""carbon dioxide (CO2)-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and that aggressive mitigation strategies could be more harmful than beneficial."" The administration has taken several steps that are consistent with that view, including (a) withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, (b) proposing to repeal the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" which found that certain GHGs cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public welfare (and thus established the need to regulate GHGs under the CAA), (c) proposing to repeal all GHG emissions standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, and (d) announcing its intent to spend $625 million to expand power generation fueled by coal and open 13 million acres of federal land for coal leasing. Those actions, plus the proposed repeal of the GHGRP, demonstrate that the current administration has committed to reduce, if not eliminate, GHG regulation at the federal level in the U.S.

Next steps

The EPA is collecting comments on the Proposal until November 3, 2025. For more information on the Proposal and instructions on how to comment, please see EPA's fact sheet.

If adopted, the final language of the Proposal would take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal Register. The Proposal states that, if implemented, 2024 would be the final reporting year, meaning affected entities would not need to submit 2025 data in 2026.

The Proposal may face legal challenges. Potential challengers include environmental advocacy groups, states, and local governments or tribes that rely on GHGRP data for policymaking and enforcement. Litigation may focus on EPA's interpretation of its authority under the CAA (particularly Section 114) or the consistency of the Proposal with the CAA's statutory purposes. Plaintiffs may also seek to stay implementation of the rule once finalized, pending judicial review.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:43.990867

The “Work and Save” program would allow those who opt in to save directly through a payroll deduction before they even see their paycheck.
The money is professionally managed through private-sector investment managers selected by the North Carolina Small Business Retirement Savings Program Board.
Lowery announced his resignation from the North Carolina General Assembly on the House floor on Sept. 23.
“This proposal, over 10 years, would save Medicaid a half a billion dollars,” said Steven Hahn, North Carolina AARP communications lead.","For some North Carolinians, the road to retirement is anything but even.

While some workers can count on employer-backed savings plans, nearly half of North Carolinians will be left navigating the path to their golden years without a map, according to an AARP analysis.

The AARP Policy Institute found that in 2020, over 48 percent of North Carolina’s private sector employees — roughly 1,823,000 people — were employed by a business that does not offer any type of retirement plan.

A proposal to help people save for retirement that’s before the General Assembly could help bridge that gap by giving hundreds of thousands of uncovered workers a clearer path toward financial security in their later years.

“It is a great way to not only save the state money, but really push for a kind of self-reliance, and encourage folks to create that culture of saving,” said Chris Brandenburg, North Carolina AARP manager of state and federal advocacy.

A 2021 Employee Benefit Research Institute study found that about 82 percent of employees with access to a retirement plan had more than $25,000 in total savings and investments, and 63 percent had $100,000 or more. However, only 28 percent of those without access to such a plan had over $25,000 saved, and only 9 percent had $100,000 or more.

House Bill 79 would provide the pathway to access through a public-private partnership retirement savings program. The “Work and Save” program would allow those who opt in to save directly through a payroll deduction before they even see their paycheck. Participation would be optional and free for small businesses, employees and even self-employed workers.

How it works, according to the bill:

Each participant’s savings go into an individual retirement account (IRA) created under the program.

By default, it’s a Roth IRA, though participants can later choose a traditional IRA instead.

Contributions are deposited directly from payroll into the employee’s IRA.

The money is professionally managed through private-sector investment managers selected by the North Carolina Small Business Retirement Savings Program Board.

The funds are held in a trust, separate from the state’s general fund. The state, employers and the Board have no ownership of participant contributions or earnings — those belong entirely to the individual account holder.

The bill received a favorable response when presented by bill-sponsor and then-Rep. Jarrod Lowery (R-Lumberton) to a committee at the General Assembly in Raleigh in late June. But it has a long way to go before becoming law.

Lowery announced his resignation from the North Carolina General Assembly on the House floor on Sept. 23. The former member has taken a role with the U.S. Department of Interior, and his brother, John Lowery, has been recommended to serve the remainder of the term.

Down the path of other ‘Work and Saves’

During the hearing of the House Committee on Pensions and Retirement, few questions were raised, but one of them was about other states doing this sort of program.

It turns out 17 have enacted an auto-IRA program, and 11 of those are up and running. The first, Oregon Saves, launched in 2017. The application of the program is working differently in some states, according to AARP.

Oregon Saves enrolled nearly 118,000 people from more than 21,000 businesses, who saved collectively $200 million through the program in 2023, according to a news release by the state.

Across multiple state programs, the total assets in auto-IRA or state-automated savings plans have passed $2 billion as of mid-2025, according to the Center for Retirement Initiatives.

The center found that automatic enrollment tends to increase saving behavior among those who would otherwise not opt in, and that opt-outs are relatively low when the process is automatic.

North Carolina’s program would be opt-in, making it different from the 17 states that have programs in place. Therefore, it’s hard to compare what program participation and savings could be in North Carolina.

“I think this is just tremendously good public policy,” said Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Raleigh) during the committee hearing. He then asked whether it could be up and running before the proposed date of July 1, 2027.

Lowery answered that the date had been chosen to give enough time for a public awareness campaign, to get a board in place to oversee it and for creating the actual system to begin taking contributions.

The bill was passed on to the House Committee on Insurance on June 25, but there’s been no movement on the bill since.

Budget ties and savings

While HB79 is on hold, the conversation around it intersects with larger fiscal debates at the General Assembly. Lawmakers haven’t yet come to an agreement on a state budget proposal this year, so they passed a so-called mini-budget in June that funds only critical programs. That limited spending plan left the state’s Medicaid program with a shortfall that’s unresolved, spurring the state Department of Health and Human Services to cut rates to providers to keep the program solvent.

Even as those Medicaid rate cuts take effect, lawmakers are weighing how to balance immediate spending needs with long-term sustainability.

“This proposal, over 10 years, would save Medicaid a half a billion dollars,” said Steven Hahn, North Carolina AARP communications lead. “That's why it's timely now in this current federal debate as states are going to have to pay more. Where are we gonna get the money? Well, let's try to get people to have enough money that they're not collecting Medicaid.”

While helping more North Carolinians save for retirement could, over time, lessen reliance on public assistance programs — it also helps those retirees actually access those “golden years.”

“If you're just betting on Social Security — it's not enough to cover housing, medications and travel right now. And that means that something's gonna have to go lacking,” Lowery said. “If you're not able to cover the cost of housing, the cost of medication, the cost of travel, you're definitely not gonna be able to enjoy life, the fruits of your labor.

“This is the way to get North Carolinians more prepared for retirement, but also help the state's long term fiscal outlook.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a5bfda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2Fa2%2F03a7648d4089b6415f41adb1c9a9%2Fretire.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 20:01:29.832463

Green industrial policy refers to deliberate government strategy designed to reshape economic structures and steer industries toward low-carbon, environmentally sustainable paths. It is not simply about building more factories or generating growth, but about aligning growth with climate goals, social inclusion, and long-term resilience.

Indonesia has recently announced an ambitious plan: to install 100 gigawatts of solar capacity, including 80 gigawatts of distributed solar arrays paired with battery storage in nearly 80,000 villages, managed by village cooperatives (Merah Putih Cooperatives) and 20 gigawatts in centralized solar plants. These village-scale solar plus storage systems are projected to produce electricity at around US$0.12 to $0.15 per kilowatt-hour over 25 years, much cheaper than the $0.20 to $0.40 cost typical of diesel-powered generation in remote areas.

The Rp 200 trillion liquidity injection aims to push state-owned banks to lend more to productive sectors. But unless some of this capital is explicitly directed toward clean energy and industrial transformation, it may miss the chance to support green industrial policy in a substantive way. For example, funds could be used to ease the upfront costs of village solar plants, subsidize battery storage procurement, support domestic manufacturing of solar panels and related components, or offer concessional finance to cooperatives that might otherwise lack credit history or collateral.

Green industrial policy typically addresses market failures: private investors are often cautious about sponsoring high upfront cost technologies whose returns are uncertain. Governments can reduce risk through regulation, incentives, public procurement, or direct investment. By doing this, they can spark innovation, build up local supply chains, foster jobs, and reduce reliance on imported technology. Instruments can include tax incentives, standards or requirements for local content, public-private partnerships, grants or loan guarantees, workforce training, and skills development.

In the context of Indonesia’s rural solar plan, green industrial policy would mean ensuring that the cooperatives have not only finance but also technical training and maintenance capacity; scaling up local production or assembly of solar panels, batteries, inverters, wiring, and mounting systems; enabling policies that lower import or regulatory hold-ups; ensuring regulatory stability so that investors feel confident; and making sure that communities share in the benefits, not just through access to electricity but through economic opportunities. Experts have already flagged gaps: cooperatives may lack technical expertise, governance capacity, and access to commercial funding; there is limited domestic manufacturing capacity; regulatory uncertainty remains an issue; and demand-side stimulus is needed so that banks will find lending attractive rather than remain cautious.

Without anchoring the liquidity injection in green industrial policy, there is a risk that funds will flow into traditional sectors or be used in ways that respond to short-term demand rather than structural transformation. The government must signal clearly that some fraction of the Rp 200 trillion is reserved for green infrastructure and energy transition, including rural solar deployment. Finance ministries, energy ministries, and industry ministries must coordinate so that regulations, incentives, and public procurement align to support solar panels, battery storage, clean energy installers, and cooperative energy governance.

It is also critical to guard against policy flip-flops, because inconsistency discourages investment. Indonesia has experienced regulatory uncertainty around rooftop solar and net metering, which reduced investor confidence. Demonstrating long-term commitment through stable rules, transparent tendering, predictable tariffs or purchase agreements, and mechanisms that require or reward local content will help.

The global audience should take notice. If Indonesia can transform a macroeconomic stimulus into a driver of green industrial policy, it will provide a powerful case study for other emerging economies grappling with climate change and development. The story could become one in which a large liquidity injection does not merely boost demand or consumption but actually retools value chains, empowers rural communities, and reduces carbon emissions in a way that is socially inclusive.

What remains to be decided is whether this liquidity moment will be treated merely as economic relief or as an inflection point. If Purbaya’s injection is steered toward solar villages, clean-energy manufacturing, skills training, and stable regulation, the result could be durable change. Indonesia may then be able to say it used its financial levers not simply to revive credit flows but to invest in its future --both clean and equitable, both industrial and green.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — International automakers are playing a major role in powering Indiana’s economy, according to a new report from Autos Drive America.

The Washington-based advocacy group found that Honda, Subaru, and Toyota have invested a combined $11.8 billion in the Hoosier State, creating 17,339 direct jobs. Together, the companies account for nearly 20% of all vehicles produced by international automakers nationwide.

Subaru’s Lafayette facility, its only plant outside Japan, employs more than 6,500 workers and is expected to produce its 8 millionth vehicle in November. Honda’s Greensburg plant supports about 2,700 jobs and has the capacity to produce 250,000 vehicles annually, while Toyota’s Princeton operation employs roughly 7,600 workers and built more than 328,000 vehicles last year.

Conexus Indiana, which studies the state’s advanced manufacturing and logistics industries, said the automotive sector represents about 20% of Indiana’s total manufacturing GDP. The state is home to 628 automotive companies and ranks second only to Michigan in automotive production. Conexus leaders said Indiana’s diverse workforce and strong supplier network make it attractive for both domestic and foreign manufacturers.

However, the organization warned of workforce shortages, projecting up to 85,000 unfilled manufacturing and logistics positions by 2033.

As automakers shift toward electric and alternative-energy vehicles, Conexus is partnering with Purdue University, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the Center for Automotive Research to help Indiana suppliers adapt to new propulsion technologies.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts.
The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis.
Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases.
They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.","The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui Province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.

That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines emit static electricity that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole.

“As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air-conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a six-inch fish he had just caught.

China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about.

But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90 percent of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid.

Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy.

In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers.

Even before Mr. Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles.

Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries.

The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule.

The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared.

“State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai.

In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated.

“To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year.

China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes.

The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than seven million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time.

In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas.

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41 percent since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away.

For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.

China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information and intolerance for public dissent.

Some villagers in Anhui Province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index/2025-05-27-china-powerlines-map-index-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:34.857112

The CIM Northern Luncheon in North Bay is an event hosted by the CIM Northern Gateway Branch, a local chapter of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. These luncheons bring together professionals from the mining industry to discuss new technologies, network, and hear from expert guest speakers.

Al Guenette, Director of New Technology and R&D NOAM at Sandvik was the key presenter as he discussed integrated bolting solutions at the event held on Wednesday at the Davedi Club in North Bay.

""So basically, it's the integration of ground support, so that's bolts that support tunnels with equipment,"" explained Guenette.

""So it's moving forward technology and helping to have a safer environment for the miners. We've been acquired by Sandvik over four years ago now, so a lot of R&D development has been done to bring both divisions together, to have a better, safer system.""

Tariff impact

It's been a turbulent time, with many industries like mining facing the challenges of dealing with U.S. tariff threats.

Guenette says the mining industry is feeling it.

""With the tariffs, I think that's definitely a big impact on business,"" he admitted.

""So you have to be versatile and flexible. So for us, we have manufacturing in Canada, but we also have manufacturing in multiple regions across the globe. So we get to have the opportunity to bring products from different regions, as well as from here in Canada.

""So the purpose of that is security of supply to ensure there isn't an outage for any of the mines. So we've been working quite hard on that for the last five years.""

Ring of Fire opportunities

But there is optimism with future projects like the Ring of Fire.

""I think everybody's interested in any type of new development and what that would look like, so we're definitely interested as far as the Sandvik equipment side, that they would go first with these types of new projects and we come in after that, so definitely exciting,"" he said.

The Energy Department recently banned several words including “climate change” and “emissions.” Bipartisan-approved renewable energy projects are being canceled. Environmental agencies are being dismantled. Climate science based policies are under attack.

These hostile attacks are using a report of the recently disbanded sham “Climate Working Group,” which was stacked with climate contrarians. The fact is that the fundamental principle of global warming is considered “settled science.” This means it is unlikely to be disproved as it is supported by abundant evidence and credible peer review.

But the current political agenda is putting corporate fossil fool cronies above the common good of the people and the planet. With the blessing of the government, this polluting industry continues to spread disinformation as well as expand their operations. In the midst of these dark times for the environment, Mid Ohio Valley Climate Action (MOVCA) is bringing an impactful, positive event to Wood County.

The event is a display of ten 36″x 30″ portraits which focus on diverse Americans who have struggled for environmental justice. Each portrait has an essential quote made by the subject etched into the painting. The paintings were done by Robert Shetterly of Maine. Shetterly refers to his paintings as “Americans Who Tell The Truth” (AWTT). The individuals are easily recognizable as he is a masterful artist. He also includes interesting biographical information about the individuals portrayed.

Until January 2002, Shetterly had never painted a realistic portrait when he painted the first of the Americans Who Tell The Truth portraits. Now numbering over 280, the portraits travel around the country as models of courageous citizenship. In addition to the loan of his portraits to schools, organizations and other interested groups, Shetterly has published several books which include photos of his portraits, the biographical info and additional essays by well known individuals.

The various volumes focus on Americans, both historic and living, who have struggled for racial, social, economic and other aspects of life in America. To help fund this exhibit, MOVCA received Direct Support Funds, a project of the Mountain Watershed Association. These funds are made possible by Cloud Mountain Foundation, The Plastic Solution Fund, The Heinz Endowments and The 11th Hour Project.

MOVCA’s truth tellers exhibit focuses on Shetterly’s book, Portraits Of Earth Justice and Americans who “…risk everything to live their truth in pursuit of environmental justice for all.” Besides 50 inspiring portraits and biographical information, the book includes essays by Bill McKibben, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Leah Penniman, Bill Bigelow and Diane Wilson.

The 10 portraits chosen for display by MOVCA include a diverse mix of persons; both young and old, female and male. Some are West Virginians.

Information about the exhibit can be viewed online under “Upcoming Events” on AWTT’s website: americanswhotellthetruth.org. The paintings will be hung for exhibition at Wood County’s South Parkersburg Library at 1807 Blizzard Drive. Starting after the library’s regular hours, an opening reception will be held on Oct. 17 from 5-8 p.m. The reception is open to the general public and will include refreshments and a Zoom with the artist from 6-7 p.m.

After the opening, the portraits will be on display for four weeks through Nov. 17. They can be viewed anytime during the South Parkersburg Library’s operating hours which are; Monday 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. This would be an interesting field trip appropriate for several grade levels of science or art classes.

AWTT’s website also offers free lesson plans, curriculum and other educational programs to ensure “… that future generations of Americans understand the value and tools of engaged citizenship.”

During the four week time frame, MOVCA is planning a few additional public events that will supplement the exhibit. MOVCA greatly appreciates South Parkersburg Library staff for accommodating the request to use their space for the exhibit, and also for pulling together additional materials that will help enrich it.

These are rough times for the environment and our planet but, now more than ever, these are the most important times to continue to speak truth to power in order to help “Save the Grandchildren.”

Renewable-fuelled plant factories ensure large-scale food supply but require low-carbon transition for environmental gains.","Renewable-fuelled plant factories (RFPFs) represent a revolutionary approach to agriculture, leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance food production while addressing significant environmental concerns. Recent studies emphasize the urgent need for innovative solutions to meet the ever-increasing global demand for food, particularly in densely populated regions. In China, a country facing immense pressure to provide sufficient vegetables for its vast population, RFPFs emerge as a promising solution. These facilities, powered by renewable energy, not only aim to fulfill dietary demands but also seek to do so in an environmentally responsible manner.

Geospatial analysis plays a pivotal role in the deployment of RFPFs across China’s 369 city-level regions. The multidimensional approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the geographic and demographic factors that influence vegetable demand. It assesses not just the potential supply of vegetables but also the infrastructural needs required to create a functioning network of plant factories. This analysis provides a vital roadmap for policymakers and stakeholders, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding the establishment and location of these sustainable food production systems.

The implementation of RFPFs can yield significant advantages, particularly in a cross-city framework. This approach promotes collaboration between different cities, enhancing the overall efficiency of the food supply chain. By leveraging shared resources and optimizing production capabilities, RFPFs can achieve a remarkable reduction in the land required for traditional agriculture, saving an astounding 51,390 square kilometers of cropland. This not only alleviates pressure on arable land but also contributes to preserving biodiversity and reducing habitat destruction.

However, while RFPFs offer numerous benefits in terms of land use and efficient vegetable production, they are not without challenges. A critical concern is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions associated with their establishment. Studies indicate that RFPFs can emit greenhouse gases at rates 1.99 to 2.55 times higher than conventional agriculture, primarily due to the energy-intensive processes involved in manufacturing power modules and constructing facilities. This dilemma highlights the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes both food production efficiency and environmental sustainability.

Mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with RFPFs is essential for their long-term viability. Transitioning to low-carbon pathways emerges as a critical strategy to address this challenge. By adopting renewable energy sources and incorporating energy-efficient technologies, RFPFs can drastically reduce their carbon footprints. Research demonstrates that implementing low-carbon strategies can lead to a reduction of up to 70% in emissions, paving the way for RFPFs to operate within environmentally sustainable parameters. This transition is crucial not just for compliance with environmental standards but for the overall acceptance and success of RFPFs in the broader agricultural landscape.

As the world grapples with the pressing issue of climate change, the urgency of implementing sustainable agricultural practices becomes increasingly evident. RFPFs stand at the forefront of this agricultural revolution, where innovation and sustainability intersect. They provide an opportunity to rethink traditional food production systems through advanced technologies that can be integrated into urban environments, ultimately reshaping how societies think about agriculture and food supply.

Moreover, the overall cost structure of RFPFs is competitive, standing at an affordable 5.88 Chinese Yuan per kilogram. This aspect underscores the economic viability of renewable-fuelled plant factories. Lower costs combined with sustainable practices can incentivize broader adoption among consumers and investors alike. As urban populations continue to grow, the integration of RFPFs into these areas could transform food distribution networks, making them more efficient and resilient against external shocks, such as pandemics or climate-induced disasters.

The urgency of adopting RFPFs is particularly pressing given the backdrop of increasing food insecurity. With global populations expected to rise significantly in the coming decades, ensuring sufficient food supply chains is paramount. RFPFs can serve as a critical buffer against food shortages, especially in urban settings where space is limited and traditional agricultural methods are impractical. They offer a scalable solution that can be tailored to meet local needs while minimizing the ecological footprint of food production.

In addition to their practical benefits, RFPFs also present an opportunity for community engagement and education. By positioning these facilities within urban areas, they can serve as educational hubs, promoting awareness about food production, sustainability, and the importance of reducing individual carbon footprints. Engaging local communities in the operations of RFPFs can foster a culture of sustainability and encourage collective efforts toward environmental stewardship.

Despite the promise that RFPFs hold for the future of food production, their successful implementation will hinge upon collaborative efforts among various stakeholders. Governments, academic institutions, and private enterprises must work together to develop the necessary regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and technological support to create an ecosystem conducive to the growth of these facilities. Research institutions can play a crucial role in advancing the technology behind RFPFs and providing critical insights into their ecological impacts and operational efficiencies.

In summary, renewable-fuelled plant factories represent a vital innovation in the quest for sustainable food production. They offer numerous benefits, including significant land savings and competitive pricing, but also pose challenges related to greenhouse gas emissions. The path forward involves a commitment to low-carbon transitions and collaborative efforts across multiple sectors. Moving ahead, it is clear that RFPFs could transform agriculture as we know it, enabling societies to produce food more sustainably while also addressing the pressing challenges posed by climate change and urbanization.

Therefore, embracing this approach not only aligns with the objectives of sustainable development but also ensures that future generations can enjoy food security in a rapidly changing world. With the right strategies in place, renewable-fuelled plant factories may well signify the future of efficient, resilient food production systems, paving the way for a new chapter in how we cultivate and consume food globally.

Energy prices are intertwined with inflation, which further clouds our stagflationary picture Trump is painting right now.","One tiny problem, outside the fact that the four biggest wind power producing states all voted for Trump by an average of 19 percent in 2024, is that Trump’s own government data doesn’t back up that assertion. “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data,” reported Politico. Energy prices across the country right now are surging, up 30 percent on average since 2020 and double the rate of inflation over the last year. There is no one singular cause to this trend that precedes Trump 2.0, but his war on renewable energy certainly isn’t helping to create the supply that increasing demand from things like AI data centers are placing on the grid.

Trump’s tariffs are raising energy costs too, as his desire to make things in America requires parts made elsewhere. “Long-term costs for utility-scale energy storage projects would increase anywhere from 12 percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the [tariff] scenario,” said data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie to Utility Dive earlier this year.

This war waged on clean energy is hitting red states, as an analysis by Energy Innovation of the GOP bill found that energy bills in Republican-leaning states could rise by more than $600 every year, and energy prices across the country could see their energy bill rise by as much as 18 percent by 2035. This study found that “Bills in Missouri will spike the most, by $640 a year, with the next largest increases – in Kentucky, South Carolina, Oklahoma, North Carolina and Texas,” as The Guardian noted in their writeup of it earlier this year. All states that voted for Trump in part because their energy bills were too high. He’s only raised them since coming into office.

Politico’s analysis of EIA data found that “U.S. power prices rose an average of 23.4 percent from June 2021 to June of this year,” and just yesterday the Trump administration decided to further immiserate their own voters by abruptly canceling a massive solar project in Nevada, another state that voted for Trump in November. Heatmap reported that the Esmeralda 7 solar project, delivering a massive 6.2 gigawatts of power to the state, was canceled seemingly out of nowhere last night. To put that figure in perspective, the Hoover Dam has a power capacity of 2 gigawatts. They canceled three Hoover Dam’s worth of energy just like that. This will raise energy bills in Nevada.

This is basic economics Trump never learned in the economics 101 class I strongly believe he never showed up to. The economy and the people who live in it demand energy to run our lives, and if there is not enough supply of energy, it will cost more. Energy prices are intertwined with inflation, which further clouds our stagflationary picture Trump is painting right now. He is depressing growth by raising energy prices and adding a surcharge on to every import while threatening to raise tariffs on China again today, all while destroying the labor market with his racist immigration policy which all combine to have the net result of potentially lowering the baseline growth we can expect from a damaged American economy.",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/10/Harvest_the_Wind_IA_7-13_13901366435-windmill.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:39.525987

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power.

“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).","A recent report estimates that New Mexico has the potential to produce substantial power from its geothermal resources.

But what will it take to tap into this substantial energy source underneath our feet that could reduce emissions and curb climate change?

Geothermal energy comes from deep within the Earth’s crust, where heat is produced by both the decay of radioactive minerals and molten rock.

This heat is key for generating electricity – usually from tapping into a hot water aquifer – which can directly heat buildings or spin a turbine’s rotor. This process emits no pollutants and, unlike solar or wind, can be available around the clock.

This type of electricity production has actually been around for a long time – getting its start over 100 years ago in areas experiencing significant subsurface geologic activity.

Tom Solomon is the head facilitator of the New Mexico Geothermal Working Group, a slew of volunteers who explore geothermal and ways that it can be brought to the state.

“New Mexico is number six in the nation in terms of its resource potential for geothermal,” Solomon said.

He’s referencing a report by Project InnerSpace, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and the Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, which singled out Santa Fe, Rio Arriba, Sandoval and Taos counties as the best candidates for geothermal exploration.

It found that New Mexico has the potential to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power. Just one gigawatt can power roughly 750,000 homes on average.

That power could then be sold to other states or attract private investment opportunities, such as data centers.

Solomon says New Mexico is just starting to explore this massive source of energy.

Right now, there’s only one utility-scale geothermal power plant, located in Lordsburg, and state officials in June announced a deal between Meta and XGS Energy to significantly boost the state’s geothermal output.

“The really exciting possibility is what's called ‘advanced geothermal,’ or ‘hot dry rock geothermal,’ which New Mexico has in abundance, primarily because of the Rio Grande rift,” Solomon said.

Bisecting the state, the Rio Grande rift is a place where the earth’s crust and mantle have been stretched, thinned, and fractured by tectonic forces – pushing heat closer to the surface.

“Meaning you don't have to drill as deep to access that really hot rock, which is the source of potential geothermal,” Solomon said.

Similar to oil and gas fracking, this method works by drilling wells into the Earth’s surface and using high-pressure water to fracture hot basement rock, creating a piping-hot reservoir.

Then, engineers can inject cold water into a well, which circulates and heats up through the hot, fractured rock, and then is brought up to the surface for use.

Wells must also be drilled very deep into the earth’s surface – sometimes 15,000 feet down. For context, the highest natural point in New Mexico is Wheeler Peak, at just over 13,000 feet.

Despite the promise of geothermal energy production, it’s been a difficult pitch to policymakers and utilities because it’s both expensive up front and the technology is rapidly evolving.

In fact, advancements in hot, dry rock geothermal are so new, experts are closely following the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale project by Fervo Energy in Utah.

There, engineers are hoping to put out 100 megawatts of electricity next year, adding 400 more by the end of 2028.

The excitement surrounding advanced geothermal system research lies in the potential to drill both vertically and horizontally, allowing wells to have more contact with a geothermal source.

By doing so, power plants can be placed pretty much everywhere, and can access more heat from the same depth. Another plus: it can utilize readily available expertise from the oil and gas industry – who use a similar technique to tap fossil fuel reservoirs.

Regardless of the type of geothermal energy, the fast pace of the industry is creating some red-hot buzz in the Land of Enchantment.

“Geothermal energy will fit like a hand in a glove in New Mexico,” said Rebecca “Puck” Stair, director of the energy conservation and management division within the Energy Minerals and Natural Resources Department (EMNRD).

Stair estimates that around 40% of the state’s electricity is sourced from renewables, putting it well ahead of its self-imposed clean energy goals. To her, geothermal could fill in the remaining 60%.

“There is a possibility that we could switch our entire electric grid over to clean power fueled by solar, wind and geothermal, and the math is penciling for that,” Stair said. “And, at the same time, still be pumping oil and gas out of the Permian [Basin] for use elsewhere in other states.”

New Mexico heavily relies on the revenue generated from the oil and gas industry to prop up its economy, and is slowly diversifying its portfolio by shoring up permanent funds and investing in other industries.

In 2024, Stair and her team were tasked by the legislature to develop rules and regulations for geothermal permitting and a separate grant and loan program to help fund projects.

Her department is still drafting those rules, but Stair said these initiatives are a huge investment, because geothermal will only be possible with private-public partnerships to construct those expensive geothermal power plants.

“I think the ball is in our court right now, and we're hopefully carrying it hard and fast,” Stair added.

Still, she hopes the state will fund mapping options to pinpoint the ideal places for geothermal, who owns that land, and nearest transmission lines to evaluate infrastructure needs.

At the Roundhouse, lawmakers continue to be enthusiastic about geothermal and say they’re open to funding more research.

“It’s a pretty win-win deal,” said State Sen. Pat Woods (R-Grady). “We've got the oil and gas industry that is very efficient at digging these deep wells.”

A longtime supporter of the oil and gas industry, Woods thinks that together, fossil fuels and geothermal could bring new rural jobs, but he’s not totally convinced it’s a silver bullet.

“I think it's a hell of an idea, but it's a ways out,” Woods said.

Woods is clear: he doesn’t want to replace oil and gas anytime soon. For now it keeps crucial dollars flowing to his constituents in the far northeastern stretch of the state.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/881715d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5152x2705+0+580/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F24%2F13%2F79988cd041a3951a0240d6da4b88%2F29206586324-7341aeaffb-o.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:24.446412

Sherman said she expects both DTE Energy and Consumers Energy will meet the intermediate goals set in Michigan's long-term energy plan, for 50% renewable electricity by 2030, and 60% by 2035. The long-term goal is 100% clean energy by 2040.

A Consumers Energy statement said the MPSC approved its updated renewable energy plan last month, which proposes to add up to 9,000 MW of solar energy resources, and up to 2,800 MW of wind capacity.

""These actions will enable Consumers Energy to achieve 60% renewable energy by 2035 and 100% clean energy by 2040. We will be filing our updated Integrated Resource Plan, our long-term energy supply blueprint, with the Michigan Public Service Commission next year,"" the company said.

In a statement, DTE Energy said it is on track to meet the 50% renewable energy target in five years.

""Since 2009, DTE has invested $4.6 billion in renewable energy infrastructure, and we plan to invest an additional $4 billion over the next several years – building approximately 900 megawatts of renewables per year on average over the next five years,"" the statement said.

“Brownwood has continually improved itself, developing quality products, cultivating a safe and engage workforce, and serving as a cornerstone for Kohler manufacturing globally.”","Kohler marked the 50th anniversary of its Brownwood plant with a ceremony Friday afternoon, during which the company announced a new venture locally – an 80-acre solar energy project.

Brian Benson, Senior Director of Global Vitreous Operations based out of the Brownwood plant, told those in attendance, “This year, in a partnership with the Brownwood Industrial Foundation, Kohler Company has signed a letter of intent to acquire 80 acres of land adjacent to the Kohler manufacturing facility, of which 20 acres will be used for a large scale solar energy project. The initiative aims to transform the vacant land into a productive, environmentally sustainable asset, creating jobs and stimulating the local economy. The project will enhance grid efficiency and generate sizable tax revenue that will support the local schools and public services. This investment will be Kohler’s largest solar installation in the United States to date as we continue to focus on building both business and community resilience. Renewable energy will alleviate grid pressure in the Brownwood community and promote resilience for Kohler’s operations.”

The project – which will be located between Milam Drive and FM 45 – will be executed in phases, Benson continued, with the first 20 acres producing 9 million kilowatts of clean energy annually. Future phases will expand the system to cover additional load and battery storage.

Kohler will secure the land through an in-kind donation totaling $50,000 to three local companies – the United Way, the VFW Post 3278, and the Ark Domestic Shelter, which will help fund a new roof for its facility, according to Benson.

The Kohler plant in Brownwood opened its doors in 1975 and has provided three generations of local residents with job opportunities, Brownwood Mayor Stephen Haynes said among his comments.

“The people who work at this plant are the heart and soul of our community,” Haynes said. “There isn’t anyone in Brownwood who doesn’t have a friend, family member or knows a valued member of the community that works here at this plant. These folks are an invaluable part of our community and they do a great job.”

Haynes continued, “We also want to give praise to the corporate executives that have made the decision to be here in Brownwood and made the decision to remain here. That is not lost on me. It says something when you make a commitment to do something, but the commitment Kohler has made goes beyond that. We see and hear and know that they’re investing and re-investing continually into this community and plant, which says they have a future here and plan to remain here, and we’re so thankful for that commitment.”

Haynes read a proclamation to mark Kohler’s anniversary, which including the following details:

The Brownwood division currently produces more than 560,000 pieces a year with plans to grow that number to over 2 million

Kohler’s plastic division produces 280,000 units annually, encompassing over 200 unique products

Kohler’s Brownwood plant plays a key role in the global supply chain, shipping over 100,000 units monthly across the United States into international destinations such as Saudi Arabia, China and England

The Brownwood facility is the exclusive global producer of pressure vessel tanks for Kohler Company

Kohler Brownwood was recently honored as the top-ranked American distribution site for achieving 100 percent on-time delivery

Adriana Stowers, on behalf of the office of Gov. Greg Abbott, said, “For half a century this facility has been more than just a workplace. It has been a cornerstone of the local economy, a partner in community growth, and a place where generations of hard-working Texans have built not only world-class products, but also lasting careers and friendships. Kohler’s commitment to innovation and sustainability, as well as to the people of Brownwood and the surrounding region, speaks to the very best of Texas values, hard work, resilience, and pride in craftsmanship.”

Heath Holtz, Chief Operations & Supply Chain Officer for Kohler, shared some of the history of the Brownwood plant, including:

In 1975, Kohler launched a pilot program for vitreous china production beginning with just 14 local associates and a handful of transfers from other sites

By 1979, Kohler expanded by 200,000 square feet to support fiberglass, reinforced plastic bathing modules

In 1982, another 604,000 square feet were added to meet growing demand

This past year, Kohler invested millions in automation, advanced equipment and cutting-edge manufacturing, ensuring that Brownwood remains at the forefront of the industry and a key producer in leading-edge bathing products for the next 50 years

Holtz also recognized 407 Brownwood members in Kohler’s quarter-century club, with two employees – Fernando Barrera and Richard Salinas – having worked at the plant for 47 years apiece.

“Above all the products that we ship and what we’ve invested in the plant, today is about the people – the associates who have built their careers here, many with decades of service and dedication,” Holtz said. “Brownwood has continually improved itself, developing quality products, cultivating a safe and engage workforce, and serving as a cornerstone for Kohler manufacturing globally.”",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1378/2025/10/10153948/img_3449-1024x577.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:30.371292

""As a result of the revised arrangement agreement between the MEG board of directors and Cenovus Energy Inc., Strathcona believes the conditions to its offer, or any reasonably improved offer, are no longer capable of being satisfied,"" Strathcona said in a release Friday.

Strathcona owns 14.2 per cent of MEG and had been offering 0.80 of one of its shares for each MEG share it did not already own.

The latest Cenovus offer announced Wednesday values MEG at $8.6 billion, including assumed debt and is made up of half equity and half stock. Its earlier offer had been three-quarters cash, and some MEG shareholders had pushed to get a bigger slice of the post-takeover company.

""While Strathcona is disappointed with this outcome, it is pleased that its actions, along with those of its fellow MEG shareholders, delivered something which the MEG board could not, namely a more equitable transaction with Cenovus which allows MEG shareholders to participate more meaningfully in future upside,"" Strathcona said.

The second phase would expand the facility so it can serve the floating offshore wind industry, the company said.
Last year, the European Commission launched a review into Chinese turbine manufactures in response to industry concerns that cheaper imports could threaten the competitiveness of European firms.","Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Ming Yang Smart Energy will invest up to 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) to build a wind turbine manufacturing facility in Scotland which could create up to 1,500 jobs, it said on Friday.

Britain is seeking to scale up renewable power to help meet its climate targets and also hopes to create thousands of clean energy jobs.

Ming Yang said the project would be built in three phases with the first a 750 million pound investment creating a facility to manufacture wind turbine blades and nacelles, with first production by late 2028.

The second phase would expand the facility so it can serve the floating offshore wind industry, the company said. Phase three would include manufacturing control systems, electronics and other key components.

""We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology,"" Aman Wang, Ming Yang's UK CEO said in a press release.

The company said a number of sites have been chosen with Ardersier Port near Inverness its current preferred location.

The Chinese company last month signed an agreement with the country's largest electricity supplier, Octopus, to explore opportunities for Octopus to use Ming Yang's technology for some of its wind projects.

Use of Chinese renewable technology has proved controversial in Europe. Last year, the European Commission launched a review into Chinese turbine manufactures in response to industry concerns that cheaper imports could threaten the competitiveness of European firms.

Britain's Energy Minister Ed Miliband visited China earlier this year to discuss climate and energy issues, and has said it would be negligent to not engage with China on climate issues.

The reality? GM isn’t scaling back its hydrogen efforts. It’s thinking bigger.

The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.

MARK TWAIN (sort of)

Like the great Sam Clemens, there seems to be plenty of confidence in the greater automotive press that GM’s decision to cancel a $55 millions fuel cell plant on the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site in Detroit. That plant, a JV with Southeast Michigan’s Piston Automotive, would have created ~140 jobs and built compact hydrogen fuel cells for light- and medium-duty vehicles under the Hydrotec brand.

That plan, frankly, was never going to work. It was always a cynical incentive grab and the first fruits of GM’s Hydrotec efforts were so laughably far behind the state of the electric art that the facts themselves blurred the line between satire and reality. Which, of course, didn’t matter – as long as the incentive money (Biden’s Department of Energy awarded GM $30 million in grants for the State Fairgrounds plant) kept flowing.

The new Trump Administration put an end to that flow last week, however, terminating 321 financial awards for clean energy worth $7.56 billion.

“Certainly the decisions of the DOE are an element of that overall climate but not the only driver,” explained GM spokesperson, Stuart Fowle, in a statement. “We want to prioritize the engineering talent and resources and everything we have to continuing to advance EVs given hydrogen is in a different spot.”

That spot is heavy-duty, off-highway, maritime, and data centers.

Bigger trucks, bigger fuel cells

Instead of dying, GM is continuing on the hydrogen fuel cell it’s been on for literal decades – with no plans (publicly, at least) to shutter its Fuel Cell System Manufacturing joint-venture with Honda in Brownstown Township, MI.

That company is not just developing HFCs, they’re out there selling fuel cells today, to extreme-duty, disaster response, and off-highway equipment customers operating far enough off the grid that access to electricity is questionable and to data center developers for whom access to a continuous flow of energy is mission-critical.

Electrek’s Take

Fuel cells like the ones from GM and Honda will continue to seem like a good idea … for about as long as it takes the heavy equipment guys to watch a ZQUIP video.

As part of the deal, Colorado's Spruce Power is working with Carolina's EnerWealth Solutions, a solar development business, to offer panel and battery storage leasing in the state.
Spruce is the owner and operator of distributed solar energy assets across the country, according to a news release.
For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology.

For customers, the result is a way to participate in so-called ""solar plus"" storage without the upfront costs needed to buy the cleaner technology. There's also typically no maintenance or end-of-lease panel removal concerns with the contracts, according to Palmetto, another North Carolina company that offers leases.

""We believe solar energy should be accessible and affordable to all and are committed to bringing clean energy opportunities to homeowners through our offering of the first solar plus storage lease in North Carolina. We appreciate that Spruce Power customized a servicing solution to meet our needs,"" EnerWealth CEO Ajulo Othow said in the statement.

Batteries provide stored electricity for later use, and even to charge electric vehicles. Customers can even sell it back to the grid, depending on plans and programs available in the area, and the lease agreement.

Leasing is also a great way to limit the electricity needed from dirty fuels that cause planet-warming air pollution. NASA has linked the gases to greater risks for extreme heat that could soon leave some places uninhabitable.

It's all good news for energy-savvy Tar Heel homeowners, as well as for the industry as a whole. Federal solar tax incentives expire at the end of the year, but Investing.com reported that Spruce was enjoying solid stock market performance earlier this month when the partnership with EnerWealth was announced.

It's also important for customers to understand the benefits of both leasing and buying. EnergySage said that an array can cost around $30,000 on average, before credits. EnergySage is a free online resource that can help customers compare quotes, find the right installer, and secure all the rebates before they are gone. Fast action can save up to $10,000 when buying a system.

Palmetto — in the business for more than 16 years — has a great guide that lists pros and cons for leasing and buying. It offers leases through LightReach and has more than 500,000 accounts. It's important to know your options to make the best decision. If you plan on selling your home soon, leasing likely isn't the best option, for example.

In North Carolina, Spruce ""will deliver the operational infrastructure that enables EnerWealth to scale rapidly while maintaining exceptional homeowner experiences,"" according to the release.

Billing, collections, support, and remote monitoring are all part of Spruce's expertise, proved by having managed 145,000 ""residential solar assets"" around the country, the statement continued.

Historic moment For Dr Al Dahak, the event reflects the UAE’s ambition to position itself as a “global convening power” on environmental issues.
They also underscore what Dr Al Dahak sees as the UAE’s dual commitment, economic growth that is “pro-climate” rather than extractive.
“We are blessed with a rapidly growing economy,” Dr Al Dahak said, “but that growth is also creating more opportunities for conservation”.
Innovation, Dr Al Dahak noted, is a necessity in a desert nation.","The UAE's Minister of Climate Change and Environment has hailed the country's hosting of a major global conservation conference this week as a “significant milestone” in its quest to help safeguard the planet.

Dr Amna Al Dahak said the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress – being held in Abu Dhabi until October 15 – served as an opportunity for the Emirates to demonstrate its rich biodiversity and environmental history and show that environmental strategies and economic development can go hand-in-hand.

The event has brought together about 10,000 delegates from more than 140 countries, including government officials, scientists, campaigners and indigenous leaders to set the global conservation agenda.

The congress was established in 1948 and has been held in all parts of the world, from Barcelona and Buenos Aires to Nairobi and New Delhi.

This year marks the first time it has been hosted in the Gulf. It was staged in the Middle East, in Jordan, in 2000.

Historic moment

For Dr Al Dahak, the event reflects the UAE’s ambition to position itself as a “global convening power” on environmental issues.

“It’s not just about hosting,” she told The National. “It’s about translating collective ambition into action on the ground. The UAE is always about action.”

“From our founding father Sheikh Zayed, we’ve had a philosophy where man and environment are integrated – where prosperity and preservation are inseparable,” said Dr Al Dahak.

The congress, follows a string of high-profile environmental milestones for the UAE, including hosting Cop28 in Dubai in 2023.

The IUCN gathering offers a chance to highlight the country’s natural heritage, often overlooked in global conversations about the Middle East.

Hidden riches in an arid land

“The international community doesn’t realise how rich the UAE is in biodiversity,” Dr Al Dahak said. “Yes, it’s an arid environment, but within our seas, mountains, and mangroves, there is extraordinary life.”

A recent project, conducted with IUCN support, identified nine Key Biodiversity Areas across the Emirates, from coral reefs and desert ecosystems to mountain habitats. About 98 per cent of those areas are already protected under national legislation.

Among them is the Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, home to the world’s largest population of dugongs after Australia. The UAE is home to 80 per cent of Gulf's seagrass meadows. “That’s what sustains our dugong population,” said Dr Al Dahak.

Such statistics challenge common perceptions of the Emirates as a land of sand dunes and skyscrapers. They also underscore what Dr Al Dahak sees as the UAE’s dual commitment, economic growth that is “pro-climate” rather than extractive.

Growth without sacrifice

The minister rejects the idea that conservation and development are incompatible. “From the beginning, the UAE set the priority that the economy must grow with the environment, not at its expense,” she said. “You don’t have to make a trade-off.”

Policies like the Circular Economy Strategy reflect that approach, aiming to align economic diversification with sustainability.

The country’s renewable energy portfolio, including the vast Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, have become a regional model. “We are blessed with a rapidly growing economy,” Dr Al Dahak said, “but that growth is also creating more opportunities for conservation”.

Restoring and innovating for the future

At the UAE pavilion, the story of the nation’s conservation journey is told through three themes – conservation, restoration, and innovation.

Restoration has long been central to the UAE’s environmental policy. The country leads global efforts to reintroduce endangered species, such as the Arabian oryx, once extinct in the wild, and collaborates with nations as far afield as Chad to restore other at-risk animals.

Meanwhile, the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund has supported projects in more than 170 countries, funding conservationists working to protect threatened flora and fauna.

Innovation, Dr Al Dahak noted, is a necessity in a desert nation. “We’ve faced challenges of heat, salinity, and water scarcity,” she said.

“We couldn’t achieve what we have without innovation.” From satellite monitoring of coral reefs to drone-assisted mangrove planting, the UAE is investing in technologies to accelerate conservation impact.

Educating the next generation

Perhaps Dr Al Dahak’s most passionate focus is education. A former educator herself, she says that every environmentalist must also be an educator. “If we want to sustain the outcomes of IUCN or any international platform, we must equip the next generation to carry that torch,” she said. “Conservation isn’t a one time effort, it’s a continuous learning process.”

Initiatives such as Plant the Emirates, a nationwide campaign combining community action with reforestation and eco-tourism programmes that introduce residents to lesser known natural sites have helped raise public awareness.

A shared responsibility

As the congress continues, Dr Al Dahak hopes delegates leave Abu Dhabi with a deeper understanding of both the UAE’s biodiversity and its belief that environmental stewardship is a shared duty. “It’s not the responsibility of governments alone,” she said. “It’s everyone’s, every individual, every parent. This is how we ensure the planet’s story continues.”",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/O5TYA6MMSRD7NO4BHVZEZQJYRU.jpg?smart=true&auth=7630895a5da1606df9422d04e27b6307491eb32b3c241dc008002ca8b2bfdf52&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-11 15:01:07.749856

Critical minerals investment company TechMet Ltd. is setting up a new trading unit to focus on specialty metals after getting additional financing from partner Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.

The unit, TechMet SCM, aims to build a trading platform to serve the rapidly growing demand for critical minerals, according to a statement on Wednesday. It will manage production from the parent company’s critical minerals assets and third-party producers. TechMet’s shareholders include the US International Development Finance Corp.

The move comes as Western nations are racing to challenge China’s dominance in critical minerals. As part of a broader effort to boost US production of the materials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March invoking emergency presidential powers to fast-track the development of new metals and mining projects.

“There’s so much interest in specialty metals which are needed for economic growth, whether that’s batteries, defense or data centers and AI,” Quentin Lamarche, chief executive officer of TechMet SCM, said in an interview. “We need to have those metals sourced in a legitimate and transparent manner and that’s why we’re aiming to create a structure that can walk the talk on this.”

TechMet and Mercuria have co-invested in several projects and ran a joint venture trading business for several years. In the past year, Mercuria has made a big push into metals — trading copper, aluminum and zinc. While the two firms will continue to look at investments together, it made sense for TechMet to operate a specialty metals and minerals business itself, Lamarche said.

The trading arm plans to expand its global footprint with teams in South Korea, Western Europe and Washington DC, according to the statement. The company is hiring a trader in Washington, Lamarche said.

“We’re operating in a business where geopolitics is heavily intertwined with business and that makes us fairly unique,” Lamarche said. “We’re very close to the policymakers having this office in DC — we believe it’s a strategic differentiator.”

While the amount of the additional investment from Mercuria wasn’t disclosed, the statement said it would bring the energy trading house’s total investment in the firm this year to $68 million, solidifying its position as one of TechMet’s biggest investors.

Three years ago I wrote about a member of the Jean Charles Choctaw Nation named Theresa “Betty” Billiot. She reminisced about how the area around her Louisiana home was once filled with cattle grazing in pastures, cotton fields, and wild prairie dotted with duck ponds. That strong memory is fleeting, as today a rising sea is all that comes into view out that same door. Flood relocation became necessary.

Isle de Jean Charles was the first US location where the federal government funded a climate-driven relocation project. Future homes were envisioned as energy efficient; able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds; well-insulated in the walls, ceiling, and under floors; supplied with certified energy-efficient appliances; and, compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Yet former island residents like Billiot aren’t happy. They describe their new homes as substandard. Rain seeps through doorways. Malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards force costly repairs.

These 37 flood refugees are not alone. Did you know that there are an estimated 2.5 million US residents who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years? A whole lotta planning needs to take place between now and then. Breaking up tightly-knit communities, land-use decisions about geographic flood relocation sites, property pricing equations, and ensuring the constitutionality of property rights all will need to be addressed.

And where in these discussions of climate victims is the fossil fuel industry, which has caused the catastrophe?

Hold the Fossil Fuel Industry Accountable for Sea Level Rise

Sea level rise is the most profound long-term impact of the climate crisis.

Rising sea levels driven by the climate crisis are overwhelming many of the world’s coastlines and waterways. Fossil fuel burning, which causes global heating, is to blame. Recent scientific studies show 1 meter (3.28′) of sea level rise is now inevitable within a century or so — and it could come as early as 2070 if ice sheets collapse and emissions are not curbed. An even more catastrophic rise of 3 meters is probably inevitable in the next millennium or two, scientists say, and could arrive as soon as the early 2100s.

With each additional degree of warming, we will witness more deadly, irreparable, and ruinous impacts from climate change. Democratic lawmakers in a dozen states want to force the world’s largest fossil fuel companies to help pay for the recovery costs of climate-related disasters. A new study published in Nature offers a framework to potentially strengthen such legal arguments by enabling plaintiffs to calculate contributions made by individual companies to rising temperatures, tying their emissions directly to extreme heat disasters.

Yet the White House is looking the other way. FEMA is under attack by the self-serving Trump administration. As NWF notes, it is often state agencies and programs that are primarily responsible for identifying impacted communities, initiating conversations with those communities, and, ultimately, collaborating with those communities to advance relocation efforts.

The Case Study of the Isle de Jean Charles

Coastal wetlands in southern Louisiana provide essential ecosystem services including reducing inland flooding, controlling erosion, and serving as natural habitat. A particular case can be made that Louisiana’s malpractices in the petrochemical sector, high cancer concentrations in these “Cancer Corridors,” and wetland demise are interconnected.

Economic prioritization (read: fossil fuel industry profitability) has led to wetland demise and destruction of livelihoods.

The Isle de Jean Charles is a narrow ridge situated in the southeastern Louisiana wetlands. Longtime inhabitants are indigenous peoples — the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s. Reliant on the natural surroundings for sustenance — think crabbing, shrimping, fishing, hunting, and agriculture — the inhabitants of the Isle hold a strong sense of place as identity markers.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres. Now it has just 320 acres due primarily to sea level rise caused by the fossil fuel-industry and their secondary effects of erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, and human-made canals.

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government. The move carried with it unsettling reminders of the forced displacement of this community’s ancestors during the Indian Removal Act of 1830.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the US. The state also has a greater likelihood to experience severe coastal flooding — approximately 9,200 square miles — over the next 25 years, as revealed by the nonprofit Climate Central.

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, titled, Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline.

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

Flaccid Flood Relocation Blueprints

Changing precipitation patterns, droughts, land degradation, flood events, and sea-level rise already affect many coastal socio-ecological systems. US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) says the rising seas present coastal homeowners with “a continually degrading situation.”

New settlements, at first glance, seem to offer more stable habitats, enhanced protection from food insecurity, expanded access to public resources, and improved healthcare. Yet the framing of resettlements as strictly an adaptive measure fails to take into account place-based attachments, such as deep connections to the land and historical memories. Moreover, the process all-too-often characterizes climate refugees as resilient and willing participants — when their buy-in to the flood relocation may not have been sought nor personally desired.

“It made us angry,” Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation, told Floodlight News. “We thought we were going to have a community, and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

Climate-induced, community-scale resettlements during the 21st century had been largely determined to be unsuccessful by those who moved. Scholars interpret flood relocation to be a result of unequal power dynamics; planning gaps need to address careful and inclusive engagement of those who would be moved.

The US Government Accountability Office has confirmed that the US has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way. Federal programs generally are not designed to address the scale and complexity of community relocation and generally fund acquisition of properties at high risk of damage from disasters in response to a specific event such as a hurricane, according to a 2020 report to Congressional requesters.

Isle de Jean Charles today is largely abandoned. Because the owners demanded continued access to their property after resettlement, however, an occasional former full-time resident visits their Isle de Jean Charles property for a night or two. Maintaining such land access allows continuity of place. It also prevents marginalization, colonization, and exploitation from powerful developers, Tharakan and Neef outline in the (2024) De Gruyter Handbook of Climate Migration and Climate Mobility Justice.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/flood-relocation.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 09:59:20.589893

Governor Maura Healey and Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll teamed up with UMass Lowell to blueprint the state’s takeover of advanced nuclear and fusion power, promising a jolt of clean energy for grids and industries alike, jobs, and economic rocket fuel.

These “Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy Roadmaps” aren’t dusty reports; they’re a four-month sprint to map out small modular reactors (think a truck-sized nuclear power plant) and sun-mimicking fusion beasts—not just for electricity, but non-power perks like industrial heat and medical isotopes too.

Massachusetts’ fresh push for nuclear power hits at a pivotal moment: The offshore wind sector—long a darling of state Democrats—now grapples with mounting delays, including a postponed Round 5 solicitation pushed back to at least 2026 amid federal permitting chaos.

The Trump administration has piled on the pressure, starting with a January moratorium on all new offshore wind leases, followed by rule overhauls favoring fossil fuels, revoked project approvals, and the cancellation of $679 million in manufacturing and port funding.

A wave of uncertainty is sweeping through America’s Battery Belt. Major electric vehicle factory projects are facing delays and potential downsizing. This shift follows changing federal policies and slower-than-expected consumer adoption of EVs.

Communities that bet their economic futures on these massive investments are now grappling with the consequences. The situation highlights the complex interplay between government policy, market forces, and regional economic development.

Planned Capacity Vastly Outpaces Projected EV Demand

A Reuters review of industry plans reveals a significant looming overcapacity. By 2030, planned battery plants could support production for 13 to 15 million electric vehicles annually. This figure comes from research firm Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.

However, market analysts at S&P Global Mobility predict a much different reality. They forecast U.S. production of only around 3 million EVs that year. This creates a potential gulf of roughly 10 million vehicles worth of unused battery factory capacity.

Policy Changes and Market Realities Hit Heartland Communities

The recent expiration of a key $7,500 federal EV tax credit has intensified these challenges. Automakers like Ford have publicly predicted a significant drop in electric car sales. This has led to repeated delays at sites like its Stanton, Tennessee complex.

The fallout is deeply felt in small towns. Local leaders who championed these projects now face resident concerns about whether promised jobs will ever materialize. Some hope companies will repurpose the massive sites if EV demand does not rebound.

The future of the Battery Belt now hinges on market adaptation. Automakers may pivot to hybrid production or other technologies. The region’s economic trajectory remains a critical story to follow.

Info at your fingertips

What is the Battery Belt?

The Battery Belt refers to a swath of new EV and battery factories across the U.S. heartland. It stretches from Georgia to Indiana and includes over two dozen major projects.

Why are these battery plants being delayed?

Delays are primarily due to slower-than-expected consumer demand for electric vehicles. Recent changes in federal incentive policies have also contributed to the slowdown.

Which major automakers have delayed projects?

Ford has repeatedly delayed its EV truck plant in Stanton, Tennessee. Hyundai’s massive Georgia project also faced a recent setback due to a federal raid, causing additional delays.

How are local communities affected by these delays?

Small towns that anticipated thousands of new jobs and economic revitalization are now facing uncertainty. Local development and construction tied to these projects have also slowed.

Could these plants be used for other purposes?

Industry experts suggest some facilities could be repurposed for hybrid vehicle production or energy storage systems if the pure EV market does not recover as projected.

House Bill 1260, sponsored by Rep. Joshua Seigel, D-Allentown, was debated in the House Energy Committee on Monday. The bill would require new warehouses to be built solar-ready and create tax incentives for retrofitting existing ones. A similar proposal is being drafted in the Senate.

Advocates argued that commercial rooftop solar offers a rapidly deployed, cost-effective way to expand energy generation while creating revenue streams for developers.

While not completely opposed to the idea, some committee members voiced concerns about mandates amounting to government overreach and suggested incentives would be a better approach.

Pennsylvania ranks eighth in the nation for the number of warehouses, and development continues to grow thanks to its proximity to major East Coast cities and robust transportation networks.

Seigel, in his cosponsorship memo, noted that 44 million square feet of industrial and warehouse space has been approved in Lehigh and Northampton counties alone in the past nine years.

Rob Bair, president of the PA Building and Construction Trades Council, testified that nearly half of all warehouse space in the state, 45.4%, lies along the Route 81 and 78 corridors.

“When you add York and Lancaster counties, that number goes to 54.4%,” he said. “We’re building warehouses along those corridors and employing a lot of people in those jobs. But we have a lot of roof space just sitting there doing nothing – we can put it to use.”

Bair said rooftop solar is low-impact, quick to deploy, and offers an added revenue stream by allowing developers to lease roof space for panels.

“And so, we’re killing a lot of birds with one stone here,” he said.

He also acknowledged concerns about large solar projects taking up farmland and forested areas, but noted that property owners have the right to lease their land as they see fit.

Rep. Jamie Barton, R-Tamaqua, questioned the difference between farmers’ rights to use their land freely while requiring warehouse developers to build solar-ready structures – a concern echoed by Reps. Martin Causer, R-Coudersport and Mike Armanini, R-DuBois, who also raised concerns about the potential cost burden on business owners.

Committee Chair Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, D-Philadelphia, stated that a commercial construction firm with decades-long experience provided her with an estimate indicating that making a 50,000-square-foot warehouse solar-ready would increase costs by less than 1%.

Rep. Paul Friel, D-Pottstown, noted that building codes are mandates designed for public benefit and believed the proposal would not be out of line. Still, he agreed with others that builders need a clear return on investment.

Large companies are already adopting solar-ready designs because they see that return, said Victoria Moroney, director of market development at ForeFront Power. She explained that solar developers can help warehouse owners monetize rooftops through power purchase agreements or leasing arrangements.

Commercial rooftop solar, she added, makes efficient use of land and generates power close to where it’s needed – reducing the need for costly transmission and distribution system upgrades and benefitting Pennsylvania ratepayers. It creates good family-sustaining jobs and comes online quickly, “which is something we urgently need right now with the PJM capacity crisis.”

The lack of solar energy in the commonwealth has contributed to higher electricity costs, said Penn Future’s Pat McDonnell. He noted that 60% of the state’s electricity is generated by gas and less than 5% from renewables.

He also said that recent hikes in Pennsylvanians’ utility bills – averaging about 15% – were partly due to gas plant failures during winter storm Elliot in 2022, and PJM’s capacity auction prices.

McDonnell pointed to Texas, now leading the nation in solar, wind, and battery development, where consumers are seeing lower energy bills.

“The time to use renewable energy is now,” he said. “It’s the cheapest form of electricity we can put on the grid, and we want to put policies in place that make full use of impervious surfaces to take advantage of an obvious opportunity to deal with energy and the climate.”

A 2023 PennEnvironment report said Pennsylvania’s 16,000-plus warehouses offer more than 516 million square feet of potential solar space – enough to generate power for more than 820,000 homes while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

There was broad agreement among participants that a balanced energy portfolio is essential in meeting the state’s needs – one that includes solar, natural gas, nuclear, wind and other sources.

“There is no magic bullet,” said Bair. And, although he expects some amendments to the bill, he welcomes the conversations about bringing new power to the grid quickly to help ease shortages.",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.sungazette.com/images/2025/10/10130200/11SolarWarehouse-750x500.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:02:50.825099

This milestone helps to showcase their commitment to sustainable innovation, while showing how dedicated they are to eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. It’s their aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040.

A Greener Shift is Happening

Even though Polestar have shown that they are embracing the green movement, this is just really reflective of a broader economic shift. If you look at the entertainment sector, for example, you will notice that streaming platforms like Netflix have much lower overheads when compared to traditional cinemas. While data centers powering them do consume energy, studies have shown that the carbon footprint of streaming is substantially lower, showing how entire infrastructures are moving to greener alternatives without compromising service offerings.

In other verticals, like iGaming, online casinos have also shown that there are sustainable alternatives that can be explored. Unlike traditional casinos that require HVAC systems, power, and lighting, online platforms offer thousands of games with a lower carbon footprint. Casino offers and promotions like free spins or deposit matches have also helped to boost player engagement without the cost of large-scale events and travel as well. Not only does this help casinos to access a bigger user demographic, but it also allows them to do so without increasing their carbon footprint. Interestingly, trends like this are converging as well.

Modern electric vehicles are not only becoming greener to make, but they are also integrating streaming services and gaming platforms within their infotainment systems. This shows how green trends can have a knock-on effect on other sectors, and for companies like Polestar, it’s helped them to create greener models that still harness the latest technology. Polestar, in particular for example, offers Android Automotive OS, which includes Prime Video, YouTube, and more through the Vivaldi Web Browser.

Polestar’s Strong Environmental Focus

Since the company began measuring its environmental focus in 2020, they have reduced their carbon footprint per sold car by nearly 25%. Significant contributors here include using low-carbon aluminium in all of their models, as well as making improvements to battery manufacturing. Renewable energy is also being used in the manufacturing process of all models, with increased biofuels on certain ocean routes. Polestar, like other companies that operate in different sectors, have shown that it is possible to detach growth from environmental impact. They also aim to do this in the future. Even though Polestar have the aim of creating a climate-neutral car, they also want to become completely climate-neutral by 2040. They also have the aim of producing a Polestar 2, which is 10 tonnes lower in carbon when compared to when the project as a whole started.

Not only is this helping to set the standard for other electronic car manufacturers, but it also helps to show how much potential there is in the market to offer more, without increasing environmental footprint. As time goes on, we can expect to see the company double down or create even more efficient cars that do not miss out on the latest tech features or advances.",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Polestar-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:15.017486

Now the story of an unlikely partnership between a utility company and climate activists and how they worked together to help one community switch its heating and cooling to a cleaner source.

Science correspondent Miles O'Brien has the story, part of our Tipping Point coverage on energy and climate.

Miles O’Brien:

Retired schoolteacher Carol Canova has lived in this tiny little house in Framingham, Massachusetts for 30 years. From this humble perch, she has experienced firsthand a historic energy transition. She started with an oil-burning furnace, then switched to gas, and now heats and cools with an electric heat pump attached to a geothermal well.

Carol Canova, Framingham, Massachusetts, Resident:

I was told it would be even heat. I was told it would be efficient and so forth. But seeing is believing. I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature.

Miles O’Brien:

Canova is part of a first-in-the-nation pilot by utility giant Eversource. It's a one-mile network of underground pipes connecting three dozen homes and municipal buildings to a shared geothermal well.

It's called networked geothermal, and if it works here, it could be a blueprint for utilities nationwide.

Carol Canova:

So I thought, oh, electricity is expensive. So I'm expecting it's going to be more expensive. What I find out is, it's overall cheaper.

Miles O’Brien:

Heat pumps live up to their name. They move heat. In the summer, they pump heat out of your home. In the winter, they bring it in. How hard they have to work and how much electricity they use depends on the temperature difference between inside and outside. The greater the gap, the more energy they need.

Shallow geothermal wells tap into the earth's steady underground temperature, about 55 degrees year-round. Water with antifreeze circulates through buried pipes, absorbing or releasing heat at that consistent temperature. A heat pump paired with a geothermal well has less work to do and is far more efficient no matter the weather above.

The catch? Drilling a geothermal well is very expensive, but none of the volunteers in this project paid a dime for either the well or the heat pump.

Carol Canova:

When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery.

Nikki Bruno, Vice President, Eversource:

Everything else is buried in underground, except for the heat pumps.

Miles O’Brien:

Nikki Bruno is an Eversource V.P.

Nikki Bruno:

So, right outside this building is what we call the main bore field.

Miles O’Brien:

She showed me the pump house, which controls the entire system. It's the only visible sign of the geothermal network.

Nikki Bruno:

Those bores are 600 to 700 pipes that allow the water-based fluid to circulate and exchange energy with the underground.

Miles O’Brien:

Besides many homes like Carol's, heat pumps attached to the geothermal network are in use at a school administration building, a fire station, and a public housing development.

It's an $18.6 million project that comes amid significant changes in regulations. Massachusetts and the other states in the Eversource territory have aggressive climate goals and mandates.

Nikki Bruno:

How do we start offering something different? How can we produce a decarbonized product for our customers, while keeping safe, reliable and I will say as affordable as possible service to customers?

Miles O’Brien:

The idea was born of an unlikely partnership between utility executives and climate activists, among them, Zeybeb Magavi, the executive director of the nonprofit HEET, the Home Energy Efficiency Team. It's a grassroots group that started out by banding together to insulate their homes. They were looking for a way to make a bigger dent.

Zeybeb Magavi, Executive Director, HEET:

We really became aware of kind of a rock-and-a-hard place problem, where we have a gas system that actually we have pipes in the ground from President Lincoln's time.

Miles O’Brien:

Their focus on creaky, leaky gas pipes led them to a moment of insight and inspiration.

Zeybeb Magavi:

The ground, the bedrock, the water all around us is thermal energy, which we can tap. And that's kind of an exciting awakening thing to realize. We could potentially build a utility street by street that was pipes filled with water, maintained and managed by the gas utility, who — becomes a thermal utility.

This infrastructure would be in a way like the roots of our new energy system, right?

Miles O’Brien:

Even federal researchers are bullish. A study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that mass adoption of geothermal heat pumps could reduce the demand for electricity by 13 percent in the next 25 years. But the idea isn't new.

Let's go down in the boiler room. Here we go. You got people down here shoveling coal, right?

Jeff Tester, Engineering Professor, Cornell University:

This is our living laboratory.

Miles O’Brien:

Cornell University engineering professor Jeff Tester built his home in Ithaca, New York, as a living lab of efficiency, solar thermal, photovoltaics, and a heat pump that taps into a geothermal well buried in his backyard.

He's been advocating for ways to tap the heat beneath our feet since the 1970s, when he helped pioneer a novel geothermal energy concept at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Jeff Tester:

One method of extracting heat or mining heat from under the surface of the earth is to create a reservoir.

Miles O’Brien:

He looks back on those days with nostalgia.

Jeff Tester:

They were very supportive of trying new things in those days. We weren't afraid to try something.

Miles O’Brien:

For about 25 years, Cornell has harnessed a natural thermal engine to keep its campus cool. A district-chilling system taps 39-degree water from the depths of Cayuga Lake to cool more than 100 buildings.

Now the university is looking to go deeper and warmer. Jeff Tester is the principal investigator on a groundbreaking project to introduce geothermal heating to the campus. In 2022, his team drilled a nearly two-mile-deep test borehole to assess the available heat resources here.

Jeff Tester:

I feel like I have been training all my life for the day when we actually would see this happen on a campus like Cornell.

Miles O’Brien:

But he's still waiting, looking for money to build a geothermal network of pipes filled with hot water to heat the campus. He says society places great value on fossil fuels and electricity.

Jeff Tester:

But heat is not viewed that way in the same way, and I think we need a fairer system of what I refer to as an equivalent way to actually look at the benefits from clean heating versus clean electricity versus clean fuels. And we're not doing that right now. So we need a new value system for energy.

Miles O’Brien:

The Trump administration apparently does value geothermal. Energy Secretary Chris Wright consistently emphasizes it as a priority, making it the only renewable energy source currently in favor.

Zeybeb Magavi:

It's something we can agree on. It's the ground beneath our feet. Turns out we have common ground.

Miles O’Brien:

And it appears to be growing. Plans are now in place to double the size of the Framingham geothermal network starting next year. Common ground may be hard to find these days, but perhaps it's not far beneath the surface.

The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” \Wiatros-Motyka said. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane.

This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”",https://www.vindy.com/wp-content/themes/coreV3_lazy_vindycustom/images/vindicatorfb.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 13:03:26.699699

FAQ: NextSource Materials Abu Dhabi Anode Project When is production expected to begin at the Abu Dhabi facility?","Strategic Significance of NextSource Materials' Abu Dhabi Anode Project

The graphite industry is experiencing a transformative shift as NextSource Materials advances its innovative Abu Dhabi anode project. This strategic initiative represents a significant move to establish substantial battery material production capacity outside traditional supply chains, addressing the growing global demand for critical components in electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage systems.

Breaking China's Dominance in the Battery Anode Supply Chain

For decades, China has maintained an overwhelming dominance in the battery anode materials sector, controlling approximately 90% of global natural graphite anode material production capacity according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. This concentration has created vulnerability in global supply chains, particularly as electric vehicle production accelerates worldwide.

The Abu Dhabi facility represents one of the most significant attempts to diversify this critical supply chain. By establishing what NextSource describes as ""one of the leading, if not the biggest, non-Chinese producers of active anode material,"" the project directly addresses concerns about supply security for Western automotive manufacturers and battery producers.

Industry analysts have highlighted that this diversification is arriving at a crucial time. The International Energy Agency's Critical Minerals Market Review notes that only about 5% of anode material production capacity exists outside China, creating a strategic opportunity for well-positioned projects like NextSource's Abu Dhabi facility.

Vertical Integration from Madagascar Graphite to UAE Processing

A distinguishing characteristic of NextSource's strategy is its vertical integration approach. Unlike competitors who often rely on third-party suppliers, NextSource controls its supply chain from mine to finished product through its Molo graphite operation in Madagascar.

The Molo mine, one of the largest and highest-quality graphite resources globally, provides NextSource with secured feedstock supply. According to the company's resource statements, the mine contains measured and indicated resources of 36.6 million tonnes at 7.68% total graphitic carbon.

This integration offers several strategic advantages. Quality control becomes more manageable throughout the supply chain, allowing NextSource to maintain consistent material specifications. The company can also tailor mine output to specific downstream requirements, creating a significant competitive edge in serving demanding customers in premium battery metals investment market segments.

Meeting Critical Demand for EV and Energy Storage Markets

The timing of NextSource's project aligns with explosive growth projections for battery materials. According to Markets and Markets Research, the global anode materials market was valued at approximately $7.9 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $27.3 billion by 2030.

This growth is driven by accelerating electric vehicle adoption and expanding energy storage deployments. Major automotive manufacturers have announced ambitious electrification targets, with many planning to be fully electric within the next decade. Each electric vehicle requires substantial quantities of battery-grade graphite for anode production.

Additionally, grid-scale energy storage installations are growing exponentially as renewable energy penetration increases, creating further demand for high-performance battery materials. NextSource's strategic positioning in this market provides exposure to both these high-growth sectors.

How Will the Abu Dhabi Facility Transform Global Anode Production?

The establishment of NextSource's Abu Dhabi facility represents a significant shift in global anode production dynamics. This project introduces substantial non-Chinese production capacity in a market that has long been dominated by Asian suppliers.

Strategic Location Benefits in UAE's Industrial Ecosystem

The selection of Abu Dhabi as the project location provides NextSource with several distinct advantages. According to the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development, the emirate offers industrial electricity rates approximately 30-40% lower than European averages, significantly reducing operational costs for energy-intensive processing activities.

The regulatory environment also provides benefits, with favorable tax treatment in designated industrial zones. This creates a competitive cost structure compared to alternative locations in Western countries with higher tax burdens and regulatory compliance costs.

Access to Khalifa Port, ranked among the top 50 global container ports, provides efficient logistics connections to both source materials and end markets. This strategic positioning enables NextSource to serve international customers through established shipping lanes with minimized transit times.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by two to 547 in the week to October 10.

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 39 rigs, or 7% below this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs fell by four to 418 this week, while gas rigs rose by two to 120, their highest since August.

In the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the biggest U.S. oil-producing shale formation, the rig count fell by one this week to 250, the lowest since September 2021.

In Texas, meanwhile, the rig count dropped by six this week to 238, also the lowest since September 2021.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output. The independent exploration and production, or E&P, companies tracked by U.S. financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to cut capital expenditures by around 4% in 2025 from levels seen in 2024.

That compares with roughly flat year-over-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021. Even though analysts forecast U.S. spot crude prices would decline for a third straight year in 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected crude output would rise from a record 13.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 to around 13.5 million bpd in 2025.

On the gas side, EIA projected a 56% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. EIA projected gas output would rise to 107.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

WATCH: Eaton Rapids solar proposal faces local opposition

2,000-acre renewable energy project proposed for Eaton Rapids

The Fiddlehead Solar Project, backed by Chicago-based Hecate Energy, would cover farmland in Hamlin Township, Brookfield Township, and Springport Township Project developer Mark Zwieg said the development promises clean energy, new jobs, tax revenue and economic activity for the area.

""We're committed to do the project the right way, we're committed to work with communities,"" Zwieg said. ""Solar and agriculture can co-exist.""

But neighbors Ali Griffith and Jasmine Emerick, who moved to the area for its agricultural character, are concerned about the project's impact on their community.

""We really wanted to raise our son around agriculture,"" Griffith said.

""So growing up here it was just so peaceful in a place that was different from living in the city."" Emerick said.

The project faces a regulatory hurdle at the local level. Hamlin Township says projects like this on agriculturally zoned land are prohibited under local ordinances. Instead, Hecate Energy plans to use a state process to work around local zoning rules.

""It provides a path to permitting,"" Zwieg said.

Public Act 233, allows companies like Hecate can work through local ordinances through the Michigan Public Service Commission state approval process. The state regulations include requirements such as a 300-foot buffer zone between houses and solar project fencing.

""It's quite upsetting and outrageous and upsetting to us that our zoning rights have been taken away from us,"" Griffith said.

Hecate's next step is submitting their Public Act 233 application, which will trigger another round of community input. Griffith and Emrick said they plan to challenge the project during that process.

""We really want to let the MPSC know our feelings about the project whether it be environmental, property value, disrupting farm land, or wildlife movement patterns,"" Griffith said. ""I think we should hammer that home to our MPSC commissioners.""

Two bills currently waiting in the state Senate - House Bills 4027 and 4028 - would restore local control for large renewable energy projects like the Fiddlehead Solar Project.

Next Steps Achieving permitting reform in this Congress is possible but will require compromise and significant stakeholder pressure.","Permitting reform for energy projects and related infrastructure has been the bipartisan, bicameral white whale of policy for a very long time. Despite broad support for the idea, agreeing on how to actually reform the permitting process has stumped lawmakers. The 119th Congress has continued along this path, with committee leadership from both parties and chambers calling attention to permitting reform and articulating the need for additional actions to speed up timelines and reduce costs for projects. In the span of 10 months, lawmakers have introduced multiple legislative proposals aimed at shortening permitting timelines and reducing the frequency of litigation. Concurrently, the courts and the Trump administration have taken their own actions to redefine the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). This alert outlines the current state-of-play in permitting reform efforts across the three branches of the federal government.

First, A Look Back

Permitting reform was on the “to-do” list for Congress when, on Dec. 21, 2024, during the lame duck session of Congress and the Biden administration, Congress passed a stopgap measure to fund the government for three months to avoid a shutdown. Yet, permitting reform provisions did not make it into the legislation passed into law.

For many lawmakers, the failure to reach a compromise deal to accelerate infrastructure development was a missed opportunity—especially as the Democratic Caucus had seemingly grown more receptive to permitting reform after hearing of delays of projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). No one possibly felt this disappointment more than outgoing Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV), who introduced the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024 and spent nearly two years pushing it through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In a pointed statement following the stopgap vote, Sen. Manchin emphasized the continued importance of permitting reform, and suggested these efforts would resume in 2025. “Meaningful permitting reform will continue … next year and cannot be done by executive action alone,” he wrote.

Before the near-finish-line failure of the Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024, there were two major efforts to update the federal permitting system; the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act in 2015, which created the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council among other things; and, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which extended the FAST Act and introduced statutory deadlines for environmental reviews among other things.

Most recently, on July 4, President Donald Trump signed H.R.1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, into law. The bill added Section 112 to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), allowing a project sponsor to pay 125% of the costs associated with developing an environmental review document. If the project sponsor elects to pay this fee, the action agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) in one year and an environmental assessment (EA) in 180 days. In an earlier version of the bill, the provision would have exempt the expedited EA and EIS from judicial review. The Senate parliamentarian removed this exemption from the final reconciliation bill after determining it did not comply with the Byrd Rule. In addition, like Sen. Manchin’s Energy Permitting Reform Act, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act mandates new oil and gas lease sales across federal lands and waters.

Recent Legislative Actions

Various permitting measures have been introduced in this Congress, and more proposals may be forthcoming.

House

The House Energy and Commerce Committee and House Natural Resources Committee have both been actively moving legislation aimed at permitting reform. Below are a few of the major initiatives pending before these committees.

SPEED Act: On July 25, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced H.R.4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. Among its most significant changes, the SPEED Act would codify NEPA as a “purely procedural statute” and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado (Seven County), by requiring federal agencies to only consider effects that are “proximately caused by” the immediate project or action. The bill would add grants to the list of actions that do not automatically trigger National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and prohibit a federal agency from withdrawing any environmental document completed under NEPA unless a court so orders, thereby stopping future administrations from rescinding environmental documents promulgated under prior ones. Regarding judicial review, the SPEED Act would restrict courts from determining a final agency action violates NEPA unless the agency clearly “abused its substantial discretion in complying with” the law and would have reached a different result absent of this abuse of “substantial discretion.”

Further, the bill would prohibit a court from substituting its judgment “for that of the agency regarding the environmental effects of a proposed agency action” and amend the steps courts must take to remand such action. Specifically, the SPEED Act would mandate that a court may only remand a final agency action if it provides specific instruction and a reasonable deadline—no longer than 180 days—to correct deficiencies. Remanded actions may remain in effect during this period.

Additionally, the bill would require parties to file legal challenges within 150 days of the final agency action’s publication and would prohibit parties from contesting the establishment of a categorical exclusion. Lastly, Chairman Westerman’s bill would require parties appealing a court ruling to do so within 60 days, with courts required to rule on appeal within 180 days. On Sept. 10, the House Natural Resources Committee held a legislative hearing to receive testimony on the bill. The committee intends to mark up the bill as soon as this month.

SPEED and Reliability Act: On Sept. 26, Reps. Andy Barr (R-KY) and Scott Peters (D-CA) reintroduced H.R.5600, the Streamlining Powerlines Essential to Electric Demand (SPEED) and Reliability Act. The bill aims to expedite the siting and permitting of electric transmission lines by amending the Federal Power Act, the primary statute governing the wholesale transmission and sale of electric power.

Currently, both the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are required to conduct National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews for the same proposed transmission line under the National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) designation process. The SPEED and Reliability Act would remove this duplicative process, requiring that only FERC conduct an environmental review.

Further, the bill would allow FERC to issue a construction permit for individual transmission lines that are designated to be in the national interest, reduce grid congestion and improve reliability without having to undergo NEPA review. The bill was referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee for further consideration.

Cheap Energy Act: On Sept. 24, Reps. Sean Casten (D-IL) and Mike Levin (D-CA), cochairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, released draft text for a bill titled the Cheap Energy Act. The lawmakers describe the draft as a “consumer-focused approach” to U.S. energy policy that ensures “cheap, reliable, and clean energy.” It includes language that would repeal the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s provisions eliminating or phasing out energy tax credits, while establishing a new investment tax credit to cover 30% of the cost of new transmission lines, modified existing lines and related property.

The bill would also codify processes for offshore wind leasing and prohibit the Department of the Interior from instating additional levels of review for solar and wind projects. The discussion draft aims to strengthen and build out additional transmission lines as it would authorize more than $2 billion to address the shortage of electricity transformers and complementary grid security technologies, and provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with exclusive siting authority for national interest transmission lines. The bill also intends to expedite the hiring of agency permitting staff and would direct the Council on Environmental Quality to create an online portal for permits that require review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Reps. Levin and Casten hope to introduce formal legislation reflecting this language in early 2026.

House Problem Solvers Caucus Framework: On Sept. 18, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of Democratic and Republican lawmakers seeking bipartisan consensus on key political issues, unveiled its new Permitting Reform Framework.

Like the SPEED and Reliability Act, the Cheap Energy Act and the Energy Permitting Reform Act, this framework would expedite the NIETC designation process as it allows for simultaneous state and federal environmental reviews. It would create categorical exclusions for simple updates to existing transmission infrastructure and pipelines, remove the need for a presidential permit when permitting cross-border linear infrastructure, and eliminate the duplicative need for a line-specific National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review pursuant to Section 368 corridors. It would also ensure that judicial standing for litigating projects is limited to parties who submitted detailed comments during public review and establish a one-year statute of limitations for litigation against most projects.

Lastly, it would direct federal agencies to replace their current paper system with a centralized cloud-based platform for all permitting processes. Reps. Gabe Evans (R-CO) and Scott Peters (D-CA), who lead the caucus’ Permitting, Energy and Environment Working Group, along with Cochairs Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY), hope to translate the framework into legislation later this Congress.

ePermit Act: On July 17, Reps. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Dusty Johnson (R-SD) introduced H.R.4503, the ePermit Act, legislation to complement the Trump administration’s efforts to streamline National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review. The bill would establish a framework for federal agencies to implement a digital permitting system for energy projects undergoing environmental reviews. It would also create federal data and taxonomy standards, and a governmentwide permitting database to enable better coordination across the federal permitting landscape. Like the SPEED Act, this bill also received testimony during a recent House Natural Resources Committee hearing and awaits further consideration.

Senate

Both Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Mike Lee (R-UT) have recently made statements demonstrating continued interest in working on permitting reform. Most recently, Chairman Lee stated “It’s time for NEPA reform” in a social media post. Below are a few of the pending proposals before their committees.

CLEAR Waters Act: On July 23, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced S.2421, the Clarifying Legal Exclusions Around Regulated (CLEAR) Waters Act. This bill, which is cosponsored by six other Senate Republicans, would amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide exclusions for the term “navigable waters.” This bill attempts to clarify that certain water systems shall not be included under the definition of navigable waters under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, including components of waste treatment systems, groundwater and ephemeral features that flow only in direct response to precipitation. The bill would also allow for additional considerations depending on the determination of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and chief of engineers of the Army Corps of Engineers. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act: On May 22, Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) introduced S.1894, the Small Projects Expedited Execution and Delivery (SPEED) Act. This bill would amend the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) to double the threshold of federal funding under which a project may still qualify for a categorical exclusion due to limited federal involvement. Specifically, the bill would allow projects receiving up to $12 million in federal funds—or have a total estimated cost of up to $70 million—to remain eligible for categorical exclusions. Sen. Lummis’ bill remains in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee for further consideration.

Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearing Act: On May 14, Sens. Tim Scott (R-SC) and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced S.1757, the Efficient Nuclear Licensing Hearings Act. This bipartisan bill would amend the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to provide for more efficient hearings on nuclear facility construction applications. Specifically, the bill would remove the requirement for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to hold a public hearing during the nuclear licensing process if an affected party does not contest the approval. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Interactive Federal Review Act: On April 10, Sens. Lummis and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) introduced S.1430, the Interactive Federal Review Act. This bipartisan bill would improve the environmental review process for highway projects through the use of interactive, digital, cloud-based platforms and digital twins. It would mandate the Department of Transportation (DOT) to select 10 federal-aid highway projects to demonstrate the use of these platforms and models in conducting the environmental impact analysis and community engagement processes that NEPA requires. The bill remains in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee where it awaits further review.

Primacy Certainty Act of 2025: On July 29, Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) and Pete Ricketts (R-NE) introduced S.2505, the Primacy Certainty Act of 2025. This bill would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to clarify the timelines and provide certainty and transparency for making a decision on the approval or disapproval of a state underground injection control program. It would mandate the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rule on state applications to regulate Class VI injection wells within 180 days. If not, the application automatically takes effect after 210 days if the state already enforces a similar regulatory program. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

MAPWaters Act of 2025: On July 31, Sens. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Angus King (I-VT) introduced S.2637, the Modernizing Access to our Public (MAP) Waters Act of 2025. The bill would provide for the standardization, consolidation and publication of data related to public outdoor recreation use of federal waterways among federal land and water management agencies. Specifically, it would direct the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to adopt interagency standards for data collection and dissemination of geospatial data relating to public outdoor recreational access of federal waterways and federal fishing restrictions. The bill was referred to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act: On July 23, Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD) and Andy Kim (D-NJ) introduced S.2390, the Unlocking Housing Supply Through Streamlined and Modernized Reviews Act. This bill would reclassify certain activities by the Department of Housing and Urban Development as it relates to housing as necessary administrative actions to allow for certain activities to be streamlined. It would also call for additional categorical exclusions if a proposed housing-related activity does not materially alter environmental conditions and does not materially exceed the original scope of the project. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act: On July 9, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) introduced S.2226, the Necessary Environmental Exemptions for Defense Act. This bill would allow for certain activities from the Defense Department to be exempt from requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act, Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, if the secretary of defense certifies they are directly related to countering the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. The bill was referred to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

Court Actions

These legislative efforts come as court rulings have reshaped the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review and the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) authorities. The section below provides an overview of the relevant court actions changing or shaping the permitting review process.

As summarized in our July 18, 2025, Client Alert, on Nov. 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit) in Marin Audubon Society v. Federal Aviation Administration, held that CEQ lacks the authority to issue binding regulations governing federal agencies’ implementation of NEPA. Specifically, the D.C. Circuit found that there is no statutory language suggesting that Congress empowered CEQ to issue binding rules and act as a regulatory agency. It contended that CEQ’s legal authority is, for all practical purposes, identical to the duties Congress assigned to the Council of Economic Advisors, another consultative agency within the Executive Office of the President. Historically, CEQ stated its rulemaking authority originated not from legislation, but from Executive Order 11991, issued by President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Executive Order 11991 replaced more than 70 different sets of agency regulations across the executive branch and helped create CEQ’s framework, recognizing its authority to advise the president on environmental issues and NEPA implementation. To this, the D.C. Circuit held that executive orders cannot give an agency rulemaking authority, only statutes can.

Months later, on May 29, the Supreme Court, in Seven County, unanimously held that NEPA reviews do not require federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts beyond the immediate effects of the action over which the agency has regulatory authority. This case concerned the U.S. Surface Transportation Board’s (STB) decision to approve an application to construct an 88-mile railroad line after performing a NEPA review. The D.C. Circuit held that STB violated NEPA by failing to sufficiently consider the reasonably foreseeable effects increased upstream crude oil production and downstream refining operations could have on the environment, given the railway would facilitate this activity. The Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit in a strongly worded opinion emphasizing that agencies, when conducting NEPA review, are not considering other “future or geographically separate projects that may be built as a result.”

Agency Actions

Concurrently, the Trump administration has taken several executive actions to facilitate permitting reform. The section below provides an overview of the recent executive actions on permitting reform.

Following the ruling in Marin Audubon Society, which held that CEQ’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations were ultra vires, President Donald Trump’s Day One Executive Order 14154 directed CEQ to eliminate its NEPA regulations. The order also revoked President Jimmy Carter’s Executive Order 11991. On Feb. 25, CEQ issued an Interim Final Rule rescinding its NEPA regulations. The final rule went into effect on April 11.

Consistent with Executive Order 14154, federal agencies must revise or establish NEPA implementing procedures that expedite permitting approvals. Executive Order 14154 also directed CEQ to provide guidance on implementing NEPA to expedite these processes. On Feb. 19, CEQ issued interim guidance calling on agencies to revise their NEPA procedures to align with Executive Order 14154 and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).

As explained in our June 2, 2024, client alert, the FRA made the following changes to NEPA:

Included new definitions for “major federal action”; 2) Limited NEPA analysis to the “reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts of the proposed agency action”; 3) Allowed agencies to rely on a final programmatic environmental document for five years without additional review so long as there are no new circumstances or information that impact the analysis; 4) Set into statute a 75-page limit for EAs and 150-page limit for most EISs. However, the FRA allows EISs to reach 300 pages if the project is extraordinarily complex; 5) Required agencies to complete EAs within one year and EISs within two years; and 6) Permitted agencies to adopt categorical exclusions listed in another agency’s NEPA procedures after meeting certain conditions.

On Sept. 29, CEQ updated its guidance to federal agencies concerning their implementation of NEPA. The new guidance asks that agencies continue to update NEPA implementing procedures to reflect Executive Order 14154 and the FRA, as well as the statutory changes that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act made and the Supreme Court’s opinion in Seven County, both of which came after CEQ issued its initial guidance.

In this updated guidance, CEQ is also providing agencies with an agency procedures template to assist them in preparing or revising their NEPA procedures. CEQ says the template is not mandatory or binding but is instead meant to provide clarity and technical assistance to agencies as they develop or update their respective guidelines. The template is organized as a Federal Register notice and offers agencies the ability to promulgate their NEPA implementing procedures for publication in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In July, departments of Energy, Agriculture, Interior, Defense and Transportation, among others, issued updated procedures to reflect recent changes to NEPA outside of the CFR in the form of guidance or a handbook. According to CEQ’s new guidance, while agencies are free to choose their own unique approaches when they are promulgating their updated NEPA procedures, they must still consult with CEQ and submit to them required documentation for review.

Next Steps

Achieving permitting reform in this Congress is possible but will require compromise and significant stakeholder pressure. The bills outlined above are an indication that lawmakers are interested in working across the aisle on reforming the permitting process for energy and related infrastructure projects. Additionally, several large trade organizations have already called upon congressional leadership to pass permitting reform, including the Edison Electric Institute, the American Petroleum Institute and the Chamber of Commerce. The pathways to moving any or all of these ideas are not limited to energy projects as Congress may look to reforming the process for permitting broader projects, including roads and bridges through the required reauthorization of the Surface Transportation bill currently moving through the legislative process.

The most significant changes are likely to come from regulatory agencies, at least in the short term. It remains uncertain exactly how much permitting timelines will accelerate under the new procedures already put in place by the Trump administration, but it is generally expected that these changes will significantly expedite the process. More executive actions like the one that established the National Energy Dominance Council aimed at coordinating agency action on permitting can be expected.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14565_3925.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 14:06:40.149688

The violations, primarily at TBC’s Bastrop and Austin sites, involve improper wastewater discharge, air pollution, and construction non-compliance, leading to $2.2 million in proposed fines from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and other agencies. This controversy adds to Musk’s regulatory challenges amid his high-profile ventures. In this article, we examine the violations, regulatory actions, and their impact on TBC’s operations and Musk’s broader enterprises. The Wall Street Journal

Details of the 800+ Environmental Violations

The violations span multiple environmental regulations at TBC’s Texas sites, particularly its 1,500-acre Bastrop campus and Austin-area tunneling projects:

Violation Count: Over 800 infractions since 2021, with 400+ related to wastewater discharges and 200+ tied to air quality breaches.

Wastewater Issues: TBC allegedly discharged untreated wastewater into local waterways, violating Clean Water Act permits. This includes 150+ instances of releasing industrial runoff without proper treatment.

Air Pollution: Over 200 violations involve unpermitted emissions from construction and boring equipment, exceeding volatile organic compound (VOC) limits.

Construction Non-Compliance: 100+ cases of unauthorized land disturbance and failure to implement stormwater controls at Bastrop.

Fines Proposed: TCEQ and local authorities have issued $2.2 million in penalties, with $1.5 million for wastewater and $700,000 for air quality violations.

TBC’s Bastrop site, home to tunnel testing and manufacturing, has drawn scrutiny for its proximity to the Colorado River, amplifying environmental concerns.

Reasons Behind the Violations

Several factors contributed to TBC’s regulatory lapses:

Rapid Expansion: TBC’s aggressive push to scale tunneling projects, including a proposed Austin hyperloop, outpaced environmental compliance efforts.

Regulatory Oversight Gaps: Texas’s business-friendly environment initially allowed lax monitoring, but increased scrutiny followed community complaints.

Operational Oversights: Inadequate wastewater treatment systems and failure to secure air permits reflect internal mismanagement.

Musk’s Approach: Critics argue Musk’s focus on speed and innovation, seen in ventures like SpaceX, prioritizes progress over regulatory adherence.

Regulatory and Community Response

The TCEQ and local authorities have intensified enforcement:

Fines and Orders: TBC faces $2.2 million in fines, with mandates to install wastewater treatment systems and obtain air permits by Q1 2026.

Community Pushback: Bastrop residents and environmental groups have raised alarms over water contamination risks, prompting public hearings.

TBC’s Response: The company has pledged to address violations, investing $10 million in compliance upgrades, but disputes some penalty amounts.

Federal Oversight: The EPA is reviewing TBC’s Clean Water Act breaches, potentially escalating penalties.

Implications for The Boring Company and Musk’s Ventures

The violations pose significant challenges:

Operational Delays: Compliance costs and regulatory delays could slow TBC’s Austin and Bastrop projects, impacting timelines for tunneling contracts.

Reputation Risk: The controversy tarnishes Musk’s image, already strained by debates like his H-1B visa defense, potentially affecting investor confidence.

Financial Strain: $2.2 million in fines and $10 million in upgrades add pressure to TBC, which has raised $800 million but remains unprofitable.

Industry Scrutiny: Increased focus on Musk’s ventures, like SpaceX’s regulatory battles, could tighten oversight across his portfolio.

The Bigger Picture: Musk’s Regulatory Challenges

TBC’s 800 violations reflect broader tensions between Musk’s innovation-driven ventures and regulatory frameworks, paralleling issues like xAI’s $10B raise amid AI ethics debates or SpaceFields’ ₹42 crore funding for defense tech. In India, where environmental compliance is critical (e.g., Bira 91’s crisis), TBC’s case underscores the need for sustainable practices in high-growth sectors.

What’s Next for The Boring Company?

Key developments to watch:

TCEQ’s final penalty ruling and TBC’s compliance progress by Q1 2026.

Potential EPA sanctions escalating federal oversight.

Community lawsuits or settlements impacting Bastrop operations.

TBC’s ability to secure new contracts amid reputational damage.

Conclusion

The Boring Company’s 800+ environmental violations in Texas, with $2.2 million in fines, highlight the challenges of balancing rapid innovation with regulatory compliance. As TBC addresses wastewater and air quality issues, its response will shape its future and Musk’s broader ventures. The controversy underscores the importance of environmental stewardship in transformative industries.",https://lapaasvoice.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Elon-Org_boring-1024x683.webp,N,,2025-10-11 13:03:49.154854

Utility-scale solar applications have popped up throughout the state as developers sought to tie in to the massive transmission line and its substations.
Another blow to utility-scale solar in Nevada The cancellation is the latest in a series of blows to the buildout of utility-scale solar in Nevada.
Now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to receive the credits.","A massive solar project proposed to be built in rural Esmeralda County with a footprint roughly the size of Las Vegas appears to have been scrapped by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).

Applicants were seeking to construct seven geographically contiguous utility-scale solar projects known as the Esmeralda 7, west of Tonopah and north of Dyer. The projects would have covered roughly 62,000 acres, but to accommodate rights-of-way and other necessary land, roughly 119,000 acres (185 square miles) were earmarked for the project.

First reported by Heatmap, the BLM’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Register on Friday listed the environmental review status for the Esmeralda 7 project as “cancelled.” The law requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions prior to making decisions.

“The BLM wouldn’t cancel it unless the proponents wanted it cancelled,” said Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, an environmental nonprofit that has opposed the project. “I just can’t think of any other reason why it would be cancelled.”

Combined, Esmeralda 7’s individual projects would have easily become Nevada’s largest solar project to date with a 6,200-megawatt nameplate capacity — the maximum amount of power they could have produced under ideal conditions — which would be enough to power millions of homes. Actual output was expected to be less.

In 2023, the bureau started the process of reviewing applications for the seven solar projects. It immediately garnered pushback from conservationists and many of Esmeralda County’s roughly 720 residents who opposed the scope of the project.

“If this is built, it’s gonna be really noticeable,” Nancy Boland, a former Esmeralda County commissioner, previously told The Nevada Independent. “Your whole sense of freedom is going to be affected.”

In a follow-up call Friday, Boland said she’s “very happy” about the news, saying Esmeralda 7 would have had outsized effects on the region’s desert bighorn sheep population.

“We were really opposed to it,” she said. “With all of these things, they should slow down. We aren’t the only ones having problems with these vast decisions with these solar things.”

The sprawling Esmeralda 7 was going to be located along NV Energy’s Greenlink project, a pair of large-scale transmission corridors set to span from Las Vegas to Reno and then east to Ely. Utility-scale solar applications have popped up throughout the state as developers sought to tie in to the massive transmission line and its substations. The Greenlink project is also facing delays, as well as ongoing rising costs.

The final environmental impact statement for Esmeralda 7 — the last step before a record of decision is issued — was set to be released at the end of April but was delayed under the Trump administration.

“While we await further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process, we remain deeply concerned that this administration continues to flout the law to the detriment of consumers, the grid, and America’s economic competitiveness,” Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email. “We need more power on the grid, fast, and the solar and storage industry is ready to provide it, but we need the administration to get serious about truly achieving American energy dominance.""

The federal government remains shut down, and multiple spokespeople for the BLM did not return Friday phone calls to The Nevada Independent.

Another blow to utility-scale solar in Nevada

The cancellation is the latest in a series of blows to the buildout of utility-scale solar in Nevada.

Under President Donald Trump’s controversial budget enacted earlier this year, utility-scale solar tax credits previously set to expire at the end of 2032 are being rolled back much sooner. Now, utility-scale projects must be under construction within the next year and completed by the end of 2027 to receive the credits.

“I believe a lot of these projects are politically not favored by Trump,” said Kevin Emmerich, co-founder of Basin and Range Watch, a conservation focused nonprofit that also opposed the Esmeralda 7 project.

The Department of the Interior, which oversees the BLM, now must specifically approve any decision relating to utility-scale solar projects, adding another layer of red tape for advancing projects.

“It doesn’t make sense monetarily for them to do this right now, with everything going on with Trump, with the lack of subsidies and the push for other types of power,” Netherton said.",https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenevadaindependent.com/2024/08/1682bdf6-esmeralda-7.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:58:17.811714

With over 150 hydroelectric projects producing affordable, reliable, and clean energy, at times we are left with excess hydropower that can be readily available to supply hydrogen projects, which in turn, can fuel heavy transportation and manufacturing projects.

In April of this year, I wrote about the importance of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and how it will help boost energy and economic development in our region. Now, due to the shutdown of the federal government caused by Senate Democrats refusing to pass a clean a continuing resolution, funding for the Hub has been eliminated. On October 2, the Department of Energy (DOE) cancelled a grant award totaling $1 billion, effectively halting the project indefinitely. Following the announcement, I reached out to DOE Secretary Chris Wright asking this decision to be reversed. I remain fully committed to the success of the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub and the hundreds of jobs it will bring to Central Washington.

Apart from the dramatic increase in energy production, the Hub would bring thousands of new jobs in engineering, construction, and manufacturing that will boost economic development and investments in local communities in the PNW. Washington’s ports, both coastal and inland, would become global centers for hydrogen exports and supply international markets with clean American fuel.

Make no mistake, the elimination of funding for the Hub is a direct consequence of the federal government shutdown. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has broader funding authority during a shutdown, and because Senate Democrats – including Washington’s Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell – did not support the House’s clean continuing resolution, the Hub’s funding was cut.

To support the Hub and all it will do for our region, I sent a letter to Secretary Wright requesting the reinstatement of funding for the Clean Hydrogen Hub Program and to work with Congress to ensure the program is managed responsibly for the sake of American energy security.

The decision marks a sharp retreat from strategies intended to buffer EV demand after the subsidy’s formal expiration on Sept. 30.

In late September, Ford and GM had quietly rolled out programs to preserve the lease-embedded credit benefit. Their financial arms would make down payments on EVs in dealer inventory before the Sept. 30 cutoff, allowing those vehicles to qualify for the $7,500 credit. Dealers would then lease those same cars to customers with the credit “baked in” to the payments.

Behind the scenes, the automakers coordinated with IRS officials to ensure the structure met eligibility rules—i.e., demonstrating acquisition by the deadline via a binding contract and payment. GM at one point planned to apply this to about 20,000 vehicles.

GM pulled back first on Oct. 8, stating it would not claim the credit and instead would fund lease incentives internally through October. A day later, Ford confirmed it would not pursue the scheme either, though it pledged to continue competitive lease pricing via Ford Credit and existing incentives.

This retrenchment follows criticism of the workarounds from lawmakers, notably Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former dealer, who called them a circumvention of policy.

Impact on EV Supply, Demand & Sales Mix

The federal subsidy for new EVs had been a linchpin of U.S. EV demand. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 expanded it and allowed consumers to transfer it to dealers at point of sale.

Its expiration is expected to erode demand sharply. Some forecasts project EV registrations could fall 20–30% without the subsidy.

Already in 2025, automakers were pushing pre-buy demand before the cutoff. Ford, for example, extended a free home charger offer to stimulate sales earlier in the year.

Beyond sales declines, GM has taken steps to scale back EV production in anticipation of reduced demand. The company plans to pause or slow output at plants producing models like the Cadillac LYRIQ and Chevy Bolt, and to delay starting a second shift on other lines.",https://www.autobodynews.com/images/June_2025/F-150_Lightning_Flash_1_full.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:01:33.892751

While many federal tax credits for home upgrades are set to expire at the end of 2025, several major state rebates created by the Inflation Reduction Act are still in effect — and for many households, these incentives can cover nearly the entire cost of improvements.

Existing state-level rebates are designed to help Americans save money on projects such as insulation, air sealing, and replacing outdated appliances like gas stoves with induction models.

Incentives like these don't just reduce monthly utility bills; they also encourage the widespread adoption of clean energy and green technology, which helps cool the planet. Many households qualify for coverage of up to 100% of project costs, making these upgrades even more affordable for low- and moderate-income families.

In the Southeast, rebate programs are already up and running in Georgia and North Carolina, with Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee preparing to launch similar energy programs imminently, according to the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

Georgia's program, for example, offers households thousands of dollars in potential savings, while North Carolina's Energy Saver initiative has already begun helping disadvantaged communities lower their energy burden.

Moreover, some programs offer retroactive coverage for projects initiated after August 2022, meaning residents may be eligible to claim savings on upgrades they've already made.

One of the most attractive opportunities to upgrade and save is in the kitchen.

Gas stoves have been linked to harmful indoor air pollution, whereas induction stoves are a safer, faster, and more cost-effective alternative. Thanks to federal incentives, Americans can still claim up to $840 off the cost of an induction range.

Renters or homeowners who are not ready to replace their stoves can start with smaller options, such as plug-in induction burners, which cost as little as $50.

Ultimately, while some federal tax credits are set to expire, appliance rebates will continue through 2031 or until funds are exhausted.

Acting sooner rather than later could translate to thousands of dollars in savings — and a more comfortable, efficient, climate-friendly home.

Whether it's an induction stove or a simple plug-in burner, small changes in the kitchen can make a big difference for your health, your wallet, and the planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/kitchen-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:01:39.396824

The landmark agreement underscores Avaada’s commitment to driving India’s clean energy transition and supporting Gujarat’s vision of becoming a leading renewable energy hub.

Massive Renewable Energy Push Across Gujarat

Under the MoU, Avaada will develop a diverse renewable energy portfolio, including:

5 GW of solar power capacity,

1 GW of wind energy projects, and

5 GWh of battery energy storage systems (BESS).

The projects will be spread across Kutch, Banaskantha, and Surendranagar districts—regions well-suited for renewable energy generation due to their vast land availability and favorable climatic conditions. Planned for commissioning between 2027 and 2030, these initiatives will significantly contribute to Gujarat’s sustainable growth, energy independence, and long-term carbon reduction goals.

Strengthening Gujarat’s Green Energy Footprint

Avaada already has a strong presence in Gujarat’s renewable energy landscape. The company is currently operating a 280 MW solar power project in Surendranagar and a 100 MW solar plant in Vadodara. With the new investments, Avaada aims to expand its footprint while reinforcing its role as a key partner in India’s renewable energy mission. The integration of battery energy storage systems will enhance grid stability. It will also improve the management of intermittent renewable generation, ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply.

Driving Jobs, Growth, and Sustainability

Beyond clean energy generation, Avaada’s projects will bring significant socio-economic benefits to Gujarat. The renewable energy expansion is expected to create over 1,000 direct and 2,000 indirect jobs, alongside 5,000 employment opportunities during the construction phase. The large-scale investment supports the state’s push for green industrial development. It also aims to attract private capital and promote sustainable livelihoods.

Reinforcing India’s Clean Energy Goals

The partnership between Avaada and the Gujarat government reflects India’s push toward renewable energy. It aligns with the National Green Hydrogen Mission and the 2070 net-zero target. By integrating solar, wind, and storage, Avaada’s initiative exemplifies the next generation of hybrid renewable projects capable of delivering both energy security and environmental resilience.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis.
Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases.
They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.
Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors.","GUQUAN, China — In China, the longest ultrahigh-voltage power line stretches more than 2,000 miles from the far northwest to the populous southeast — the equivalent of transmitting electricity from Idaho to New York City.

The power line starts in a remote desert in northwest China, where vast arrays of solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity on a monumental scale. It snakes southeast, following an ancient river between mountain ranges before reaching Anhui province near Shanghai, home to 61 million people and some of China’s most successful electric car and robot manufacturers.

That’s a single power line. China has 41 others. Each is capable of carrying more electricity than any utility transmission line in the United States. That’s partly because China is using technology that makes its lines far more efficient than almost anywhere else in the world. The feat is owed to China’s ambitious national energy policies and the fact that few residents along the path of these lines dare object — even though the lines emit static electricity that local people said they could feel when holding a metal fishing pole.

“As long as you don’t fish directly underneath the wires and keep the fishing line from getting tangled in the wires, it’s basically fine,” Shu Jie, an air conditioning repairman, said matter-of-factly, showing off a 6-inch fish he had just caught.

China’s aggressive embrace of clean energy technologies, at a faster pace than even its own government expected or planned, has left it with an unquenchable thirst for electricity. Half the country’s new cars are battery-powered, and the 30,000 miles of high-speed rail lines run on electricity. Wind and solar energy provided over a quarter of China’s power in April, a milestone that few other countries can brag about.

But much of that clean energy is produced in the country’s sunny, windy western and northern regions, far from most of its people and factories. More than 90% of China’s 1.4 billion people live in the east, where cloudy days, windless nights and sluggish rivers limit the potential for clean energy. So to move the electricity to where it is needed most, China is urgently upgrading its power grid.

Beijing’s central planners, having underestimated the country’s swift adoption of solar and wind energy, are building the world’s first nationwide grid of ultrahigh-voltage power transmission lines.

Beijing’s expansion of its power grid contrasts sharply with President Donald Trump’s “Drill, baby, drill” approach of doubling down on fossil fuels and rolling back federal programs to spur greater use of clean energy.

In July, the Energy Department terminated its commitment to provide a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for construction of the Grain Belt Express power line to take wind power from Kansas to cities in Illinois and Indiana. That 800-mile ultrahigh-voltage line, which would have covered a shorter distance than dozens of lines already built in China, ran into criticism from rural landowners and Republican lawmakers.

Even before Trump took office, other renewable energy projects in the United States had to wait as long as 17 years for permits to be approved for transmission lines running a few hundred miles.

Many of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines use direct current technology, which allows them to carry electricity for long distances with barely any of the transmission losses that affect most high-power lines in other countries.

China’s more efficient power lines have broad consequences for the global race against climate change. They will help determine how quickly China can reduce its world-leading use of coal, a stain on the country’s clean energy track record. China uses as much coal as the entire rest of the world, and emits more greenhouse gases than the United States and the European Union combined.

The more advanced power grid is starting to address a central problem facing China’s energy planners. In its western regions, where the weather is favorable for solar, wind and hydroelectric power, China produces more renewable energy than it can use.

Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, set a goal in 2020 of tripling the country’s capacity to generate wind and solar energy by 2030. The country reached that mark last year — six years ahead of schedule.

The country’s government-owned electricity transmission giant, State Grid, was caught unprepared.

“State Grid is good at building things, but not six years ahead,” said David Fishman, an electricity consultant in Shanghai.

In some recent months, a tenth of China’s wind and solar capacity has gone unused partly because the grid was unable to move all the power generated.

“To improve the power system’s ability to absorb new energy, we must accelerate the construction of power grid projects supporting new energy,” Du Zhongming, electricity director of the National Energy Administration in China, said at a news conference last year.

China already consumes twice as much electricity as the United States. By 2050, China plans to triple its count of ultrahigh-voltage routes.

The most recent public Chinese data, from the end of 2024, showed 19 lines transmitting power at 800 kilovolts. Another 22 lines operated at 1,000 kilovolts. One of them, the behemoth terminating in Guquan, transmits enough electricity at 1,100 kilovolts to power more than 7 million American households or 40 million to 50 million Chinese households.

To put the scale of China’s power grid build-out in perspective, consider that the United States has a handful of 765-kilovolt lines and a few running at 500 kilovolts or less, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit research group. The 765-kilovolt lines together total about 2,000 miles — the length of a single line across China.

The Soviet Union built a power line in Central Asia that was designed to operate at 1,150 kilovolts. But it used less powerful equipment and has not run at full tilt for decades.

The development of China’s ultrahigh-voltage lines was given a push in 2009, during the global financial crisis. The central government approved enormous investments in their construction to create jobs and head off an economic slowdown. China’s leaders staked ambitious plans for electric vehicles and high-speed rail lines around the same time.

In March 2011, the construction of ultrahigh-voltage lines gained further momentum from the partial meltdown of three nuclear reactors after an earthquake and tsunami in Fukushima, Japan. Beijing delayed many prospective nuclear reactors, which had been planned near cities, and doubled down on transmission lines from remote areas.

Construction of the power lines has helped China reduce its emissions of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gases. A University of Chicago analysis of satellite data, released in August, found that air pollution in China had plunged 41% since 2014. That added almost two years to the country’s average life expectancy.

Beijing, once notorious for smog, mostly stopped burning coal for electricity in 2020 and now relies partly on wind power delivered from hundreds of miles away.

China’s ultrahigh-voltage network has helped the country limit its dependence on imported oil and natural gas, but it has also created new vulnerabilities. Much of northwestern China, where many of the lines are being built, is mountainous. As a result, lines had to be closely bunched as they hug a single, flood-prone tributary of the Yellow River that passes between earthquake-prone mountain ranges from Dunhuang to Lanzhou in Gansu province.

For decades, countries have talked about building power lines similar to China’s. They have found it difficult to persuade people living along the routes to accept any high-power lines, much less ultrahigh-voltage lines.

China can build faster because of its top-down industrial planning, government control of information, and intolerance for public dissent.

Some villagers in Anhui province living near China’s longest ultrahigh-voltage line said they had reservations about the line, although they did not try to stop its construction.

The line carries mostly solar and wind energy, as well as some coal-fired power, from the Gurbantünggüt Desert in Xinjiang. It helps supply electricity to big eastern Chinese cities like Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Nanjing.

Xu Shicai, a farm manager in Xuchong, a village next to lines that pass within 30 yards of homes, expressed concern.

“When you hold an umbrella in the rain, sparks will fly from it, and you’ll feel numb,” he said. “When fishing, it’s hard to hold the pole under the wires, as your hands feel very numb.”

The village’s small fish pond lies directly under the power lines. A “no fishing” sign has a cartoon of a skeleton being electrocuted and a graphic photo of a badly burned man who was apparently electrocuted. But Xu and other residents said that did not stop many villagers from fishing because the pond was so close by.

Xu said he accepted the power line because it was an important national project, but he worried it might scare off visitors. “I’m used to it now,” he said. “But honestly, we don’t want more lines built here.”

Starting in November 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, the stock market took off and now sits at record highs, following three years of double-digit gains. Solomon warned that some of the current AI frenzy was similar to the dot-com mania of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Most investors recall the incredible sell-off that followed almost five years of seemingly endless new highs for the stock market, before the bubble burst on March 10, 2000, and bottomed out in October of 2002. The Goldman Sachs leader warns that a “drawdown” (another term for a sell-off) could occur in the next 12 to 24 months. With a vast window like that, there is an excellent chance he will be proven right.

Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is the world’s second-largest investment bank by revenue and is ranked 55th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue. The Wall Street white-glove giant offers financing, advisory services, risk distribution, and hedging for the firm’s institutional and corporate clients. We review the firm’s Conviction List of top stock ideas every month, seeking companies that offer the highest dividends and have the safest investment profile. Four current picks are ideal for investors concerned about the potential for a “drawdown” over the next one to two years, which seems likely given the current lofty levels at which the stock market is trading.

Why we recommend Goldman Sachs stocks

Goldman Sachs is the acknowledged leader in the investment landscape on Wall Street and worldwide. The firm’s top-notch research department continues to provide institutional and high-net-worth clients with the best ideas across the investment spectrum. It is likely to continue doing so for years. While the firm states it is not yet time to worry about a tech bubble, it is likely high time to prepare for one. They said this recently:

There are elements of investor behavior and market pricing currently that resemble previous bubbles, including the rise in absolute valuations, high market concentration, increased capital intensity among leading companies, and the emergence of vendor financing. However, we see key differences: First, the appreciation of the technology sector has been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation about future growth. Second, the leading companies that have seen the strongest returns have robust balance sheets. Third, the AI space has, so far, been dominated by a few incumbents; most bubbles form during a period of intense competition as both investors and new entrants flood into the space.

Ken Paxton walked onto the stage with a pyrotechnic introduction.

Hundreds of young faces at the Texas Youth Summit, held outside of Houston last month, stared at Paxton as he boasted about the more than 120 combined lawsuits he filed against former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He recounted the obstacles he has overcome since becoming Texas attorney general a decade ago, including a historic impeachment that concluded with his acquittal. The crowd cheered.

He then made his pitch to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who Paxton said has been in office since the 62-year-old was in college.

“I just decided, you know what? It's time that we have representation in Washington that will fight for us,” Paxton said to a roar of approval. “We deserve somebody that will fight for our constitutional rights.”

Paxton’s speech was among a series of recent stops the attorney general has made in front of young Republicans, a group that’s riding a surge in political momentum in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Paxton and other Republican candidates vying for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats are trying to tap into that energy to gain an edge in the wide-open contest, betting that Kirk's killing will galvanize turnout among a voting bloc that usually stays home during primaries.

In the last few weeks, Paxton said he would “look into” Texas Christian University for allegedly canceling an event with an anti-trans influencer, even though the school has said the event was never booked in the first place. This week, he spoke at a packed rally held by the Texas Tech University chapter of Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded when he was 18

He’s also the only Texan scheduled to speak at America Fest, Turning Point’s annual marquee event in December. He will share the stage with other grassroots GOP powerhouses like Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon and Kirk’s widow, Ericka.

Paxton “is special like President Trump in that he is the exception and not the rule,” said Christian Collins, a former congressional candidate and aide who founded the Texas Youth Summit in 2019.

Collins described Paxton as an accessible elected official who gave Collins his cellphone number the first time they met, and whom Collins often greets at events all over the state, where Paxton often speaks with activists and parents. “Ken Paxton is just a darling of the MAGA movement,” Collins said.

Still, Paxton is campaigning with a lot of baggage in tow. Despite emerging victorious in the political and legal battles he often brings up in front of audiences, some Republican strategists believe he could cost the party the Senate seat in a general election against a Democrat.

The accusations Paxton has weathered include committing securities fraud, abusing his office and having an extramarital affair.

The primary race also grew more crowded this week when U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, announced his bid for Cornyn’s seat. Hunt is a former Army combat veteran, a rising Republican star and an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump. He is also courting young voters: He was among the speakers at the Texas Youth Summit, and his campaign pointed to events where he has spoken at schools in his district.

“Young people are the future of this country, and as the youngest candidate in the race for U.S. Senate in Texas, I will bring a fresh perspective to the Senate,” Hunt, 43, said in a statement.

Cornyn’s campaign noted the senator headlined the Texas Young Republicans Federation convention the same weekend that Paxton and Hunt spoke at the conference in The Woodlands.

“Sen. Cornyn spends considerable time with young conservative professionals around Texas,” campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak said. “We will actively compete to win the votes of as many young Texas GOP primary voters as possible in this race.”

It remains to be seen whether the energy radiating through young conservatives in Texas and beyond will continue into the March primary and election day next year.

Texas’ young voters have historically made up a sliver of overall turnout in elections, including primaries, which are arguably the most important elections in Texas. While some years have seen voters under 30 sign up to vote in droves, they don’t always make it to the polls.

But Paxton and the other candidates may have good reason to believe that could change following Kirk’s killing on a Utah campus in early September.

Texas already has hundreds of Turning Point USA chapters, which help spur conservative activism, register voters and host events with GOP influencers and elected officials who fire up students and encourage them to continue their organizing.

The organization has received more than 120,000 inquiries since Kirk’s death to start new chapters across the nation, with a spokesperson recently saying, ""We are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and college campus in America.""

“There is no question that Charlie Kirk's assassination tragically, yet poignantly, has been a turning point for America and especially for conservatives,” Mackowiak said.

The United States has announced an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, effective November 1, 2025, which will raise the overall tariff rate on Chinese imports to approximately 130%.

The announcement, made by President Donald Trump on October 10, through a Truth Social post, marks the sharpest escalation in US-China trade tensions since the original tariff war began in 2018.

GTRI stated ""The impact will be felt quickly. Prices of EVs, wind turbines, and semiconductor parts are expected to rise, while the U.S. will try to ""friend-shore"" its mineral supply chains to Australia, Vietnam, and Canada. China, meanwhile, is likely to redirect supplies toward its non-Western partners to strengthen alternative industrial networks"".

U.S. President Donald Trump has announced an additional 100% tariff on all Chinese imports, effective November 1, 2025. This is in addition to existing tariffs and comes in response to new export controls on rare earth minerals imposed by China, indispensable for US defence, electric vehicles, and clean-energy industries.

The GTRI report also noted that, given the strategic importance of rare earths to US industries, Washington may soon have little choice but to reach a new deal with Beijing. Unlike the US, which often acts before weighing economic consequences, China appears more deliberate and better prepared.

The report highlighted that America still depends heavily on China for electronics, textiles, footwear, white goods, and solar panels, leaving it exposed to retaliation.

As prices surge once the new tariffs take effect, President Trump could struggle to contain inflation and production costs. His tough-on-China strategy risks backfiring--hurting US consumers and undermining his broader economic agenda.

It stated, ""As prices surge once the new tariffs take effect, President Trump could struggle to contain inflation and production costs.""

For India, the report stated that no deal with the US is ever final.

ADVERTISEMENT

The much-publicised US-China ""Phase One"" trade deal of 2025, which capped US tariffs at 30 per cent and China's at 10 per cent, has already been overtaken by the new 100 per cent duty order.

GTRI suggested that India must negotiate carefully and on equal terms, ensuring reciprocity and preserving strategic autonomy.

ADVERTISEMENT

It added that rather than relying on shifting U.S. promises, New Delhi should focus on building self-reliance in critical technologies and minerals.

GTRI noted that this will help insulate the economy from future trade shocks while allowing India to leverage its neutral position to strengthen ties with both Western and BRICS economies.

The evidence is there–melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather. Climate change is accelerating, but instead of taking action, we have attached party identities to the issues and are now facing the consequences of political polarization.

Party issues create swings between administrations–these frequent reversals are what make our system of government unique. But unlike some domestic policies where this “swing” can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

I graduated from high school this spring, and while I just began studying political science, I am no expert yet. Already in my lifetime, I have noticed environmental changes in Iowa: frequent flooding, record temperatures, and extreme storms. That’s why I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a volunteer organization seeking bipartisan climate solutions through grassroots advocacy.

CCL’s neutral approach bridges many perceptions and concerns about climate policies, and one opportunity to exercise this is through lobbying. Thanks to fundraising led by Northeast Iowa’s CCL Chapter Leader Leslie Sand and a generous grant from the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, I have had the opportunity twice now to lobby Iowa’s members of Congress for bipartisan climate action.

During meetings with Reps. Ashley Hinson and Randy Feenstra and Sen. Chuck Grassley, our focus was on the role of clean energy and the global “clean energy race.” But policy compromise still felt out of reach because of a major national barrier: political parties.

Political polarization has national leaders trapped in rigid agendas. One reason for this could be because political identities have become a defining factor in political decisions and voting patterns through political polarization, both at an individual and party level, which encourage party-line votes. But another reason could be political pressure from party leaders or administrations to vote and act certain ways. This is a big problem, especially for climate policies.

Climate policies are urgent, but as work continues to find bipartisan solutions, our leaders seem to be drifting farther apart. Climate change does not care how you vote. It is our responsibility to remind our leaders to work together and prioritize bipartisan climate action.

Despite divisiveness within our current political environment, I remain optimistic. My conversations locally and in D.C. have changed how I approach climate change, and I believe that by working together, we can protect our future.

It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov.
The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects.
Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan.
“ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”","Louisiana officials have canceled another major coastal restoration project — the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion on the east bank of Plaquemines Parish.

Gordon Dove, chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, confirmed to WVUE-TV Fox 8 Wednesday that the state will not continue the Mid-Breton Sediment Diversion. The project would have channeled fresh water and sediment from the Mississippi River near Wills Point to the dying coastal marshes of Breton Sound.

It is the second major coastal restoration project Gov. Jeff Landry has shut down. He scrapped the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project in May even though $3 billion from the Deepwater Horizon settlement was available to complete the project and $560 million had already been spent. Construction hadn’t yet begun on the Mid-Breton project.

Both projects served as key initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, which has been in place for nearly two decades. Although the state is currently operating other river diversions, they are smaller in scope and designed only to prevent saltwater intrusion — not restore land.

Landry’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Thursday afternoon. He previously criticized the Mid-Barataria project for its rising costs and potential harm to oyster fisheries in that area.

Dove told WVUE the cost of Mid-Breton had ballooned from several hundred million dollars to an estimated $1.8 billion. The state has over $8 billion set aside for coastal restoration projects. The money came from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement.

Coastal marshland serves as a natural storm barrier against hurricanes and soaks up rain and flood waters. It also creates habitat for fish and wildlife and absorbs air pollution.

Louisiana has lost more than 2,000 square miles of coast since 1932, according to the 2023 Coastal Master Plan. Scientists say the marsh is dying because it stopped receiving the nutrient-rich fresh water and sediment once levees were built to control flooding along the Mississippi River. Rising sea levels brought about by climate change have made the situation worse, the plan stated.

Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, criticized the state’s decision in a news release Thursday, saying it goes against accepted science and the interests of Louisiana residents.

Cancelling the project could also place other coastal restoration efforts in jeopardy. Restore spokesman Charles Sutcliffe pointed out that other initiatives in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan, such as marsh building projects, rely on the sediment diversions for their long-term sustainability.

Dredging and marsh creation projects left in the plan are going to sink and erode without a consistent source of fresh water and sediment, Sutcliffe added. He questioned the point of having a Coastal Master Plan that many stakeholders agreed on if one person can decide “behind closed doors” to cancel its biggest projects at any time.

The state’s Coastal Master Plan represents years of bipartisan work and investments from government officials, scientists, business owners, residents and engineers. The Mid-Breton project was added to the plan in 2007.

“This cancellation disregards the decades of transparency and significant effort that went into research, permitting, community engagement and modeling for the project,” Restore said in a news release. “ … Canceling this project puts integral large-scale, sustainable coastal restoration years, or even decades, further out of reach.”",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/10/6.-Mid-Breton-WVUE.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 09:59:24.651717

The Senate recessed last night and is scheduled to return on Tuesday, October 14, making it unlikely that military service members will receive a paycheck on October 15. Republican leadership continues to say they will not bring a standalone bill on military pay to the floor; however, Rep. Jen Kiggans’ (R-VA) bill to ensure military pay (H.R. 5401) has 148 co-sponsors (104 Republicans, 44 Democrats). Notably, Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Rep. Ken Calvert (R-CA) signed onto the bill. The White House has reportedly considered using tariff revenue to cover the next military paychecks. The two current inflection points are military pay and the fact that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is unlikely to acquiesce, given the “No Kings” events scheduled for October 18.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) is no longer allowing Minority Leader Schumer to file cloture on the Democrat CR (S.2882), meaning it will no longer be regularly voted on. This leaves the Republican House-backed CR (H.R. 5371) as the only option forward. The Democrats have one more reconsideration left for their CR, which they may bring forward at any time.

Today, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) announced there will be more rescissions coming. Rescissions are the formal process of rolling back funding that Congress has already appropriated. There have been two rescissions so far this term, at the request of the White House. The first was a Congressionally approved rescission of $9 billion in funding, and the second was a “pocket rescission” of $4 billion, the nature of which allowed for the side-stepping of Congressional approval. The introduction of another rescission could push lawmakers even further away from an agreement on reopening the government.

Reductions in Force

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought posted on social media that reductions-in-force (RIFs) have begun. In response, Leader Thune said, “I think they held off as long as they could.” As promised, the layoffs are coming from not-yet-specified “Democrat programs” across nine agencies, including the Department of the Interior, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of the Treasury, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It appears that it is primarily currently furloughed employees who are receiving RIFs.

Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) has spoken out against Director Vought’s mass layoffs, saying she “strongly opposes [the] attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.” Many details are still unfolding. Here is what has surfaced so far:

HHS employees received a memo stating that the RIFs are “a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown.”

The only specified number of layoffs at this time is 1,300 workers from the Department of the Treasury.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been specifically identified for layoffs within DHS, but it is unclear if that is the only program within the agency that will face personnel cuts.

The world is aiming to develop a more cooperative narrative in the energy sector as it deals with the substantial shift in the energy sector.

Gulf energy heavyweights are raking in billions by fostering international investment in their energy industries

The Gulf region has long been the envy of other high-energy usage countries around the world. They have vast amounts of natural resources that have enabled the countries in the region to become heavyweights in the boxing ring of the global economy.

The economic boom that is currently unfolding in the region can be attributed to the fact that the Gulf nations are selling off minority stakes in huge projects that deliver substantial financial returns.

Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, and other huge energy companies have raised astronomical sums of money by offloading minority stakes of their pipeline and infrastructure businesses to global investors.

The appetite for cash-generating, stable assets in the region is on the rise, evidenced by ADNOC’s $10.1 billion pipeline sale and Aramco’s $15.5 billion deal. Several buyers, including energy giant BlackRock, can rely on long-term financial returns that are sustainable and strengthen the Gulf nation’s energy companies’ financial footprint in the sector.

BlackRock is among several international companies aiming to expand their presence in the Gulf region, along with KKR and Brookfield, with BlackRock even setting up shop in Kuwait. The International Monetary Fund has noted that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is essential for the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to shift away from over-reliance on hydrocarbon revenues and develop new, non-hydrocarbon sectors.

Gulf firms are turning their infrastructure into funding powerhouses in the current trend unfolding

The current trend of huge energy companies in the Gulf region selling off assets to bring in foreign investment is not limited to one nation, with the trend spreading from the UAE to Bahrain. The hope would be for the recent shift in the region to inspire other energy-rich regions in the world to follow the example set by the Gulf nations.

As the world is aiming to shift away from conventional energy generation towards the renewable energy sector, the cornerstone of the global energy industry is raking in billions of dollars, evidenced by the recent litany of deals taking place in the Gulf region.

Global industry insiders have praised the shift in the Gulf region regarding substantial foreign investments.

“To accelerate the region’s transformation and fulfill the GCC governments’ extensive economic goals, substantial private foreign investment is essential. The continued growth of the region’s economies could unlock considerable foreign direct investment (FDI) as international firms are keen to be a part of the region’s economic growth.” – Ernst & Young Global Limited

They’re also worsening tensions among administration officials responsible for all the chopping.

Last week, the Trump administration canceled about $8 billion in clean energy grants — mostly in Democratic states and districts — appearing to fulfill Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s promise to rein in Biden-era spending on wind, solar, battery and other energy technology he considers a “bridge to nowhere.”

But then a new, unconfirmed list of additional cuts surfaced, adding billions of dollars more to the potential total. Many of those newly targeted projects are in red states and districts, causing a week of confusion and heartburn on Capitol Hill. The fallout inside the White House and DOE could be even worse, Sophia Cai and Ben Lefebvre report.

“It’s toxic af over there,” one person who works with senior DOE staff told POLITICO via text. “The boys are fighting.”

The White House initially pushed back on Wright’s summer plan to cut grants, arguing that some of the funding could serve as leverage in negotiations with Congress and states, one administration official told Sophia and Ben. In other cases, an industry representative said, the White House wanted Wright to cancel projects he hoped to preserve.

Rival factions

The disagreement has heightened internal divisions at DOE, where rival factions are clashing over process and priorities, possibly delaying the release of a final list of projects on the chopping block.

Meanwhile, Republicans on Capitol Hill are still defending the administration amid the broader uncertainty of the government shutdown. “What’s happened is the White House has to make some very serious and difficult decisions,” Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the Republican whip, said at a Friday press conference when asked about the cuts.

It remains unclear how long the Trump administration and DOE can hold off a public revolt within their own ranks. Republicans are already under fire from Democrats over the government shutdown. And today the White House said it is making good on its promise to start firing more government workers, including at the Environmental Protection Agency and DOE (its so-called “reduction-in-force” plans).

Fresh backlash from constituents over canceled energy projects could add to their political headache.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), for example, told POLITICO’s Morning Energy this week that he’s pressing DOE to “stick with the things that they said they would do in North Dakota” after both a hydrogen and carbon capture project in the state showed up on the list of potential cuts.

Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), a key backer of the $925 million ARCH2 hydrogen hub in her state — another project on that list — said Thursday she’s still seeking clarity.

“DOE told me that the list is just a broad list; there’s no real intent to cancel all those projects,” Capito said. “But some may get canceled, so it’s still just unclear.”

Clash in Illinois over how to lower electricity bills

Illinois lawmakers are negotiating a wide-ranging bill aimed at mitigating rising electricity costs and building more grid-scale energy storage.

Democratic leaders and clean energy advocates blame White House antipathy toward clean energy and the state’s grid operator for what they’re now calling an energy affordability crisis, Jeffrey Tomich writes. Lawmakers supporting the legislation say they want to insulate the state from swings in federal energy policy.

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said state Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus. “We have to take action here in Illinois.”

Some Republicans and large energy users, however, say some parts of the bill will only increase electricity prices.

“This is a significant rate increase on every consumer in Illinois, whether it’s a homeowner, a school, a church, a retailer or manufacturer,” said Mark Denzler, CEO of the Illinois Manufacturers Association.

Coal pollution rose during last shutdown

Some types of air pollution from coal plants increased during the previous government shutdown as companies “strategically” sidestepped environmental rules, according to new research.

The findings from researchers note that the types of pollutants that increased during the shutdown of 2018 and 2019 were monitored by people who had to collect samples. Other types of pollutants are monitored by devices that automatically send data to EPA — and those types didn’t rise substantially, Ariel Wittenberg writes.

The fear among researchers and advocates is that the same could happen today. EPA sent its first furlough notices to staff on Thursday.

“I can’t believe we are in exactly the same situation again,” said Neha Khanna, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Binghamton University in New York who co-authored the research on emissions.

It had been one of a number of Nevada desert solar projects steadily advancing through regulatory review. Around 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under review by the Bureau of Land Management when Trump took office still await action.

That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project.

GEORGETOWN, Ky. (Oct. 10, 2025) – Toyota advanced its environmental sustainability efforts today with the launch of a new solar panel installation at its flagship manufacturing facility in Georgetown. The project was celebrated with a ribbon-cutting ceremony that brought together plant leadership, team members and community partners.

The nearly thirty-acre solar field marks a significant step forward in Toyota’s journey to reduce its carbon footprint and transition to renewable energy sources. The system is expected to generate approximately 15 million kilowatt hours of clean electricity annually, enough to power 1,400 average U.S. homes for a year.

“This project reflects our values and our commitment to being a good citizen,” said Chad Miller, vice president of manufacturing at Toyota Kentucky. “At Toyota, we believe in building more than just vehicles; we’re building a future. This solar installation is a powerful example of how we have aligned operations with our goals to reduce Toyota’s overall environmental footprint.”

The initiative supports Toyota’s broader environmental strategy, outlined in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, including the goal of making all its manufacturing facilities carbon neutral by 2035.

Just as the automaker is known for the built-in quality of its vehicles, Ebonye Allen, environmental engineering manager at Toyota, emphasized the importance of working toward sustainability in every aspect of its operations. “This isn’t just about renewable energy, it’s about reaffirming our commitments. Namely, our commitment to being good neighbors in the communities where we have operations and creating a robust company culture of environmental sustainability.”

Toyota Kentucky is the automaker’s largest facility globally, employing nearly 10,000 proud Kentuckians. The facility assembles the Camry Hybrid (America’s best-selling passenger car for 22 consecutive years), the RAV4 Hybrid (America’s best-selling SUV for 8 consecutive years), and the Lexus ES350.

Assembly of Toyota’s first battery electric vehicle in the U.S. is scheduled to begin at the plant in 2026.

NextStar Energy is expanding its manufacturing of EV battery cells and modules at its facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada.

NextStar Energy: EV battery manufacturer

NextStar Energy was formed in 2022 as a joint venture between LG Energy Solution and Stellantis.

The company is advancing battery manufacturing with the goal of promoting sustainable mobility solutions.

NextStar aims to be Canada’s first large-scale lithium ion battery production plant with its site in Ontario.

Stellantis and LG Energy Solution invested more than CAD$5bn (US$4.1bn) to construct the facility, with support from the Canadian government.

Danies Lee, CEO of NextStar Energy, says: “This achievement is the direct result of a shared vision, effective partnership and incredible hard work of everyone involved.

“As we transition from construction to operations, I am deeply grateful for the collaboration between our partner companies LG Energy Solution and Stellantis, our construction partner Alberici-Barton Malow, the City of Windsor, the provincial and federal governments and all who have supported our project to be completed safely and on schedule.”

The NextStar Energy facility

Construction began on the site in November 2022 and it has meant that 9,000 Canadian trade workers have contributed more than 8.4 million work hours.

NextStar Energy has received its Occupancy Permit for the cell manufacturing plant.

The permit marks the completion of the facility’s construction and brings the company closer to starting its operations.

It plans to begin in-house production of cells by the end of 2025.

The facility’s core operations include electrode production, cell formation and assembly and module assembly.

It is planned to have an annual production capacity of more than 45 gigawatt hours and will produce a target of 2,500 new job opportunities in the surrounding areas.

The company is committed to using sustainable business practices, including protecting the environment, upholding human rights and using resources responsibly.

Its aim is to create shared value, promote social growth and build a sustainable future.

NextStar will support Stellantis’ Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan which aims to have more than 50% Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) sales in North America by the end of the decade.

About battery module production

NextStar Energy began battery module production in 2024 by using externally sourced cells.

As operations begin, in-house cells will be used to manufacture battery modules.

The modules are grouped together in a battery pack, which is then used to power electric vehicles.

The site features 11 buildings including two main manufacturing facilities and nine support buildings.

The manufacturing facilities are separated into Cell and Module production and the support buildings include a recycling centre and safety testing laboratory.

The Occupancy Permit means that the facility is fully approved for safe occupancy and it is ready for production to begin.

Drew Dilkens, the Mayor of Windsor, Ontario, says: “Completion of construction and the granting of the Occupancy Permit marks a major milestone for the game-changing NextStar Energy battery manufacturing facility in Windsor.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/c50d3e01bef6f6fde39c51ff7eb1cc08:13e5e6d6d25c49176f857b25a026a3d2/nextstar-energy.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 06:58:01.634760

Ken Paxton walked onto the stage with a pyrotechnic introduction.

Hundreds of young faces at the Texas Youth Summit, held outside of Houston last month, stared at Paxton as he boasted about the more than 120 combined lawsuits he filed against former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. He recounted the obstacles he has overcome since becoming Texas attorney general a decade ago, including a historic impeachment that concluded with his acquittal. The crowd cheered.

He then made his pitch to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, who Paxton said has been in office since the 62-year-old was in college.

“I just decided, you know what? It’s time that we have representation in Washington that will fight for us,” Paxton said to a roar of approval. “We deserve somebody that will fight for our constitutional rights.”

Paxton’s speech was among a series of recent stops the attorney general has made in front of young Republicans, a group that’s riding a surge in political momentum in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Paxton and other Republican candidates vying for one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats are trying to tap into that energy to gain an edge in the wide-open contest, betting that Kirk’s killing will galvanize turnout among a voting bloc that usually stays home during primaries.

In the last few weeks, Paxton said he would “look into” Texas Christian University for allegedly canceling an event with an anti-trans influencer, even though the school has said the event was never booked in the first place. This week, he spoke at a packed rally held by the Texas Tech University chapter of Turning Point USA, the group Kirk founded when he was 18

He’s also the only Texan scheduled to speak at America Fest, Turning Point’s annual marquee event in December. He will share the stage with other grassroots GOP powerhouses like Donald Trump Jr., Steve Bannon and Kirk’s widow, Ericka.

Paxton “is special like President Trump in that he is the exception and not the rule,” said Christian Collins, a former congressional candidate and aide who founded the Texas Youth Summit in 2019.

Collins described Paxton as an accessible elected official who gave Collins his cellphone number the first time they met, and whom Collins often greets at events all over the state, where Paxton often speaks with activists and parents. “Ken Paxton is just a darling of the MAGA movement,” Collins said.

Still, Paxton is campaigning with a lot of baggage in tow. Despite emerging victorious in the political and legal battles he often brings up in front of audiences, some Republican strategists believe he could cost the party the Senate seat in a general election against a Democrat.

The accusations Paxton has weathered include committing securities fraud, abusing his office and having an extramarital affair.

The primary race also grew more crowded this week when U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, announced his bid for Cornyn’s seat. Hunt is a former Army combat veteran, a rising Republican star and an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump. He is also courting young voters: He was among the speakers at the Texas Youth Summit, and his campaign pointed to events where he has spoken at schools in his district.

“Young people are the future of this country, and as the youngest candidate in the race for U.S. Senate in Texas, I will bring a fresh perspective to the Senate,” Hunt, 43, said in a statement.

Cornyn’s campaign noted the senator headlined the Texas Young Republicans Federation convention the same weekend that Paxton and Hunt spoke at the conference in The Woodlands.

“Sen. Cornyn spends considerable time with young conservative professionals around Texas,” campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak said. “We will actively compete to win the votes of as many young Texas GOP primary voters as possible in this race.”

It remains to be seen whether the energy radiating through young conservatives in Texas and beyond will continue into the March primary and election day next year.

Texas’ young voters have historically made up a sliver of overall turnout in elections, including primaries, which are arguably the most important elections in Texas. While some years have seen voters under 30 sign up to vote in droves, they don’t always make it to the polls.

But Paxton and the other candidates may have good reason to believe that could change following Kirk’s killing on a Utah campus in early September.

Texas already has hundreds of Turning Point USA chapters, which help spur conservative activism, register voters and host events with GOP influencers and elected officials who fire up students and encourage them to continue their organizing.

The organization has received more than 120,000 inquiries since Kirk’s death to start new chapters across the nation, with a spokesperson recently saying, “We are on the cusp of having a TPUSA or Club America chapter in every HS and college campus in America.”

“There is no question that Charlie Kirk’s assassination tragically, yet poignantly, has been a turning point for America and especially for conservatives,” Mackowiak said.

Ming Yang said the £1.5bn project would create up to 1,500 jobs, with the first production taking place by late 2028.

The firm, which is the largest private wind turbine manufacturer in China, has shortlisted the green freeport site at Ardersier as its preferred location for the facility.

Ming Yang said it would invest up to £750m in the first phase of its investment before expanding to create an ""offshore wind industry ecosystem"" around the hub.

It has been in talks with the Scottish and UK governments over the past two years.

The firm's UK chief executive, Aman Wang said: ""We firmly believe that by moving forward with our plans to create jobs, skills and a supply chain in the UK, we can make this country the global hub for offshore wind technology.

""We fully support the government's mission to become a clean energy superpower, and I'm confident that once the plans are approved we can make a valued contribution to this goal.""

But a Conservative MP has previously questioned the wisdom of letting the company invest in the UK.

Last November, MP Nick Timothy asked UK energy minister Michael Shanks about Ming Yang's plans to invest in Scotland, saying the government should rule out investment from ""hostile states"".

Timothy said Ming Yang ""benefits from huge subsidies in China,"" adding any investment was subject to ""serious questions about energy and national security"".

The UK government's Energy Secretary, Michael Shanks, said he would ""encourage investment"".

In a statement released on Friday, a UK government spokesperson said: ""This is one of a number of companies that wants to invest in the UK.

""Any decisions made will be consistent with our national security.""

A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed the news that Ardersier had been chosen as Ming Yang's preferred location for investment.

""This port is strategically important to the growth and success of the offshore wind sector,"" they said.

""This illustrates the strength of opportunity and huge economic potential that the Scottish offshore wind sector offers.

§ 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status.
Bottom Line: A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No.
913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice.","In short, not much.

On October 1, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued Order No. 913 (the “Order”) as a Direct Final Rule implementing Executive Order 14270, “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

The Order targets 53 outdated, “seldomly used,” or duplicative regulations, inserting conditional sunset provisions that will phase them out one year after the rule’s effective date—unless FERC extends the deadline by up to five years after soliciting and considering public comments on the costs and benefits of the regulations. The Order takes effect 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Two changes in particular apply to (1) certain transmission service applicants and (2) entities seeking to self-certify their exempt wholesale generator (“EWG”) or foreign utility company (“FUCO”) status. These changes will not impact any substantive requirements for these entities but will slightly relax the filing process by eliminating language regarding providing a form of notice of such filings.

18 C.F.R. § 36.1(b)(1) – Transmission Service Application Notices

Section 36.1(b)(1) of FERC’s regulations currently requires an applicant seeking transmission service under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act to include with its application a form of notice of the application suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the requirements of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations. That section, in turn, requires a “draft notice in accordance with the form of notice specifications prescribed by the Secretary and posted on the Commission’s website under Filing Procedures.”

Change:

This subsection will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the Order unless extended. Once sunsetted, applicants for Section 211 transmission services will no longer be bound by this notice requirement.

Impact:

Applications under Section 211 require a notice containing information about the transmission service requested and the facilities involved be provided to the parties potentially affected by the request, such as the transmission facilities owner, the relevant ISO/RTO, the interconnecting utility, and the state’s public utility commission. These requirements are set forth in Section 36.1(b)(2) of FERC’s regulations and are not changing. However, eliminating the form of notice requirement under Section 36.1(b)(1) will streamline the application process and relieve the filers from the requirement to follow an older notice format.

18 C.F.R. § 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings

Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status. Similarly to Section 36.1(b), Sections 366.7(a) and (b) require entities seeking to obtain EWG or FUCO status – either through a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order – to include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations.

Change:

These mandatory Federal Register form of notice provisions in Sections 366.7(a) and (b) will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the rule unless extended.

Impact:

This change has limited practical significance. FERC previously provided guidance that, at least in connection with a notice of self-certification of EWG or FUCO status, a form of notice is no longer required, stating that “[a]lthough the Commission’s regulations specify that a notice of self-certification should include a form of notice of the filing suitable for publication in the Federal Register, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(a), it is no longer necessary to submit this form of notice.” However, removing this requirement from the regulations will align them with FERC’s current practice and will reduce confusion among filers.

Bottom Line:

A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No. 913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice. With respect to Section 211 transmission service requests and EWG and FUCO filings, the Order does not change any of the substantive requirements for such filings, but removes the form of notice requirement from FERC’s regulations, thus simplifying and modernizing the regulations and, perhaps in some cases, streamlining the filing process.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14205_3939.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 03:59:06.891531

Following years of hints and pricing teases, EV giant Tesla just showed off its lower-cost trims, designed to drive volume without disrupting the lineup.

The market reaction, though, was immediate and surprisingly mixed, reflecting the tension between list prices and perceived step-up in value.

A quick read on Tesla's lower-cost options:

Models/prices: Model 3 at $36,990; Model Y at $39,990.

Hardware/software: Familiar packages marked by incremental updates through Tesla’s over-the-air updates.

Target buyer: First-time EV shoppers backed by fleet and mass-market channels.

First read: Stock is down 4% on launch day.

Despite the drop, though, Tesla stock is in the green year-to-date, while its three-month performance is even more impressive at 47%.

Over the past few months, its tape has turned explosive, following a steady spring rally as shares ripped through Q3, capped by September’s 35% moonshot. Stacking the last six months, the incredible run clocks in at roughly 90% on compounded math.

That’s where longtime Tesla bull and veteran tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush drops in with a healthy new target, and a caveat. He didn’t mince words on the budget EV development, but did drop an explosive new price target. However, the upside pivots on a different engine of value entirely.

Dan Ives hikes Tesla target but slams “uninspired” budget EVs

Wedbush tech analyst Daniel Ives didn't hold back on Tesla’s new low-cost models, calling them “relatively disappointing,” stating that the features and pricing fall short of sparking fresh demand.

Tesla’s latest move was intended to offset the loss of U.S. EV tax credits and revitalize deliveries toward a 500,000-unit quarterly run rate. Instead, the market yawned, and investors are viewing the trims as a $5,000 markdown instead of a true product refresh.

Ives called it more of a “pricing tactic, not a catalyst,” arguing the models genuinely lack differentiation and come at a time when BYD, Nio, and XPeng are gobbling up Tesla’s lunch in global EV sales.

Surprisingly, however, he maintained his buy rating and reaffirmed his Street-high $600 price target, implying a massive 37% upside from current levels, based on Tesla’s AI and autonomy pipeline.

He points to the successful June launch of Tesla’s Robotaxi service in Austin, early traction for Full Self-Driving version 14, and AI-trained humanoid robots driving the company’s real valuation drivers.

In his view, Tesla’s next leg of expansion has less to do with it cutting stickier prices and more to do with proving its software is worth a premium that the rest of the market can’t match.

Quick takeaways:

Ives unimpressed: Wedbush’s Daniel Ives called Tesla’s new Model 3 and Model Y “relatively disappointing,” saying that pricing tweaks won’t drive new demand.

Market reaction: Shares fell 4% on launch day, with investors viewing the rollout as a simple markdown on the back of cutthroat competition from BYD, Nio, and XPeng.

AI remains the bet: Ives still backs Tesla’s AI future and keeps a buy rating with a $600 target (37% upside).

Chinese rivals are outrunning Tesla on 2025 deliveries

China’s EV heavyweights are setting a blistering tone as they continue widening their lead over Tesla.

For perspective, EV front-runner BYD sold 396,270 new-energy vehicles (NEVs) in September, up 6% sequentially, while capping Q3 at 1.11 million units as it shifted further toward pure EVs. Through September, the company’s year-to-date tally stands at an eye-catching 3.26 million, well ahead of every global rival.

XPeng is also surging from a smaller base, posting a record 41,581 September deliveries (+95% year over year, +10% sequentially) and 116,007 units in Q3 (a 149% jump from last year). As it stands, the EV upstart’s nine-month total of 313,196 already dwarfs 2024’s full-year output.

On top of that, Nio isn’t far behind, delivering 34,749 vehicles in September (up 64% year over year) and 87,071 in Q3 (up 41% year over year), both records that underscore the company’s turnaround in volumes and momentum.

Tesla hit a record 497,099 global deliveries in Q3, but its lead is shrinking quickly. In 2025 volumes, BYD’s roughly 1.6 million pure EVs outpaced Tesla’s near 1.2 million, a clear reversal of leadership in global all-electric sales.

Looking at the most recent stretch, the pattern is just as clear.

BYD delivered nearly 770,000 vehicles across August and September combined, while XPeng strung together three consecutive monthly records (36,000 in July, 37,709 in August, and 41,581 in September).

Similarly, Nio climbed steadily as its deliveries came in at 21,017 in July, 31,305 in August, and 34,749 in September.

Each company is marching forward with aplomb into the final quarter, posting superb gains that highlight how quickly China’s EV ecosystem is growing compared with Tesla’s steadier pace.",https://www.thestreet.com/.image/t_share/MjEzNjIxNjQwMjU5NDQ2MjIz/elon-musk-not-happy.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 22:59:42.429879

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT CLIMATE AND DEMOCRACY

STATE NEWS

STATES ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY AMIDST FEDERAL ATTACKS: As Donald Trump and congressional Republicans attack clean energy, state leaders are enacting policies to advance clean energy, which will lower energy costs and pollution. Across the nation, state and local leaders are taking legislative and executive action to protect the environment, lower utility bills, and reduce pollution.

OUR TAKE: LCV Vice President of State Policy and Advocacy Bill Holland said, “State and local leaders continue to provide a different path focused on deploying clean energy at scale, reducing pollution, and lowering utility bills. In recent weeks, we’ve seen actions like California governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order to speed up clean energy projects eligible for federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits before they expire, and New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherril’s No Rate Hikes pledge that she made on the campaign trail last month. These actions follow months of significant steps taken at the state level to build renewables and protect ratepayers around the country.

“In partnership with groups across the country, the League of Conservation Voters’ state affiliates in the Conservation Voter Movement have rallied the public and won meaningful progress nationwide. Together, they understand that our collective response has never been more important. State action is critical to not only hold the line against federal attacks, but to keep the country moving forward on climate.”

STATES STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY AGAINST AUTHORITARIANISM: As the Trump administration attempts to dismantle our democracy at the federal level, LCV partners in the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM) are working overtime to secure major democracy victories in the states. From legal protections for voters of color to fighting partisan gerrymandering, states continue to make progress to protect voting rights and fight authoritarianism.

OUR TAKE: LCV State Democracy Policy Senior Director Amanda Gnaedinger said, “States across the country are fighting to defend a free and fair democracy. Our best course of action for a stronger democracy is to not only protect fundamental freedoms, but expand democracy so it is a responsive and trusted institution for all people—no matter their race, income, ability, or zip code. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) along with over 30 state partners, collectively called the Conservation Voters Movement (CVM), has worked this year to successfully secure legal protections for voters, lessen the damage of Trump’s Project 2025 agenda, and slow the creep of authoritarianism into state legislatures in state houses around the country.

“The relentless attacks on our communities and freedoms coincide with environmental and energy policies that are leading to higher costs, more pollution, and more extreme weather. These challenges cannot be solved through advocacy if we are left with an unresponsive, unrepresentative democracy. Therefore, in order for everyone to enjoy clear air and water, public lands, and affordable clean energy, we must all rise to make sure our government can hear us, protect us, and reflect us all.”

INDIANA RALLIES AGAINST PARTISAN GERRYMANDERING: Vice President J.D. Vance visited Indiana to pressure lawmakers to redraw congressional maps and eliminate the two seats held by Democrats. In response, Indiana Conservation Voters (ICV) held a rally to tell Indiana lawmakers: No mid-decade map meddling. ICV has led the charge over the past month in opposition to map manipulation, including early rallies and delivering thousands of petition signatures to legislative leadership.

ICV TAKE: Indiana Conservation Voters said, “Hoosiers have been more than clear on this issue over the past two months: We don’t want Washington outsiders telling us how to run our state. Attempts to redraw Indiana’s legislative maps in the middle of the decade are unfair, unnecessary and out of step with hard-working Hoosiers’ priorities.

“What’s more, they want to come into our state and tell us what to do with our legislative process while the federal government is shut down. Maybe they should just stay in Washington and clean up their own mess instead of disrupting our lives and our state with their political shenanigans.

“Indiana leaders should continue to reject this distraction from D.C. and stay focused on the real issues that matter to Hoosiers: inflation, energy costs and taxes.”

OREGON MOVES TO FAST TRACK CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS: Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed an executive order to accelerate renewable energy projects before federal tax credits expire. The executive order will focus Oregon’s agencies to speed up its permitting process to complete energy projects that create jobs, build energy capacity, and lower costs.

OLCV TAKE: Oregon League of Conservation Voters said, “Federal tax credits for renewable energy projects will expire next year, due to the elimination of these incentives by the Trump Administration. However, thanks to Governor Tina Kotek’s Executive Order, Oregon will speed up its otherwise lengthy permitting process to get these projects underway before the deadline. This Executive Order defends Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and our state’s energy resilience. We’re glad to see Oregon leading, joining a handful of states who have sped up their processes as well.”

ARIZONA RALLIES COMMUNITY TO DEMAND ENERGY JUSTICE FROM APS: Chispa AZ and community members burdened by $300–$500 monthly bills and record-breaking heat gathered outside the Arizona Public Service (APS) substation wall to protest the utility’s latest proposed rate hikes. Organizers called out the company for fueling the climate crisis and shifting costs onto communities already most impacted.

CHISPA NEVADA HONORED WITH GREEN IMPACT AWARD: Chispa Nevada was honored with the Green Impact Award at the Nevada Conservation League’s Home Means Nevada 2025 Awards Dinner. The award recognizes locally rooted organizations leading the way on environmental and climate justice. Chispa NV was celebrated for its community-driven advocacy to ensure cleaner air, renewable energy, and a more equitable future for Nevada’s families.

NATIONAL NEWS

KAINE, HEINRICH MOVE TO END TRUMP’S SHAM ENERGY EMERGENCY: Senators Tim Kaine (VA) and Martin Heinrich (NM) reintroduced a resolution to terminate the sham Trump Energy Emergency order, which was designed to line the pockets of Big Oil rather than lowering energy costs. The resolution failed after senators voted along party lines.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Federal Advocacy Campaigns Director Leah Donahey said, “Democrats are fighting back to address rising costs by voting unanimously to reject Trump’s energy emergency order. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans continue to do the bidding of Big Oil at the expense of hardworking families. At a time when energy demand is increasing and costs are skyrocketing, we should be focused on deploying the cheapest and fastest energy – clean wind, solar, and batteries. Yet Trump and Republicans continue to cancel cheaper, faster, and more reliable clean energy projects daily. The Trump administration is determined to prioritize the agenda of billionaire CEOs by forcing expensive coal-fired plants to stay open, selling off our public lands to drilling and mining, and canceling clean energy initiatives. We applaud Senators Kaine and Heinrich for continuing to push back against Trump’s sham, which is designed only to line the pockets of Big Oil CEOs and put the health, affordability, and safety of our communities at risk. We are all in to continue fighting for clean energy incentives and projects that keep costs low and work for everyone.”

HOUSE DEMOCRATS CONDEMN CANCELLATION OF $8 BILLION IN ENERGY PROJECTS: Last week, the Trump administration and the Department of Energy announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in clean energy projects in politically targeted states. Over 160 House Democrats wrote a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemning the likely illegal action, which will eliminate jobs, weaken our electric grids, and raise electricity prices.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS’ TAKE: From the letter, “This decision is a reversal of properly awarded projects that will harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge. This Administration’s decision to play political games will result in genuine harm at a time when millions of American families are already struggling to pay their electricity bills amidst the everrising cost of living. These blatantly partisan cancellations must immediately be reversed.

“The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation. Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

TRUMP ADMIN ROLLS BACK PROTECTIONS FOR ALASKA WILDERNESS: President Trump signed an executive order approving the Ambler Road Project in Alaska. This decision opens up Alaska’s treasured public lands for mining, threatening local communities and the environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV Conservation Program Director America Fitzpatrick said, “While the government is shut down for the people, Trump is making sure it stays open for billionaire polluters. Approving the Ambler Road Project ignores science, years of engagement with Alaska Native communities, and public input. This reckless decision will harm the health of Alaska Native communities and their way of life and Alaska’s wildlife and treasured public lands of the Brooks Range and Gates of the Arctic. This is just the latest example of Trump continuing to give away our public lands despite the fact that these sell offs are deeply unpopular amongst the majority of people across the country.”

167 MILLION ACRES OF FEDERAL LANDS AUCTIONED OFF FOR COAL: The Trump administration hosted a coal lease sale in Montana auctioning off 167 million tons of coal on federal lands. The auction drew only one bid for $186,000, just one-tenth of a penny per ton of recoverable coal. Even taking into consideration the new cut rates for coal set by the Trump administration, the bid was rejected by BLM. This flop of a lease sale exemplifies that, in addition to damaging surrounding environments and public health, coal is inefficient and unpopular.

It is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

He singled out the endangerment finding, as “the holy grail of the climate change religion” and said he was thrilled to end it.

The EPA also called for rescinding limits on tailpipe emissions that were designed to encourage automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US.

Three former EPA leaders have criticized Zeldin, saying his March proposal would endanger the lives of millions of Americans and abandon the agency’s dual mission to protect the environment and human health.

“If there’s an endangerment finding to be found anywhere, it should be found on this administration because what they’re doing is so contrary to what the Environmental Protection Agency is about,” Christine Todd Whitman, who led EPA under the Republican president George W Bush, said after Zeldin’s plan was made public.

As a result, Texas is moving forward once again with its Texas Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Plan, originally approved in 2022. The plan faced an uncertain future after the suspension of $5 billion in federal funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, which aims to make EV ownership more accessible by supporting robust charging infrastructure across the country.

The Texas plan remains largely the same following the freeze, but the federal level requirements and guidelines for the NEVI program as a whole have shifted slightly: states are no longer required to place chargers no less than 50 miles apart, and can decide individually what a reasonable distance is (though Texas has opted to stay true to the original guidelines, according to its own EV Infrastructure Plan). This change actually could aid in the acceleration of EV infrastructure adaptation in many states, as the 50 mile rule led to complications and slow downs during the first three years of the NEVI program.

The Federal Highway Administration also no longer requires states to factor in extreme weather evacuations in site placement or make an effort to benefit disadvantaged communities in their plans.

Texas to invest nearly half a billion in EV charging

According to Texas’ plan, Texas will invest over $400 million from the federal government and $77 million from the private sector to strategically place EV charging stations every 50 miles along interstate highways (deemed “Alternative Fuel Corridors”) during phase 1, and every 50-70 miles in some rural areas during phase 2. There are 84 planned interstate highway stations, supplemented by 34 Volkswagen-funded stations. Each station will feature a minimum of four DC fast-charging ports, capable of charging most EVs from 10% to 80% in just 30 minutes. To ensure accessibility, all stations will be located within one mile of the highway.

Looking ahead, the plan outlines a broader statewide expansion, aiming to bring EV charging infrastructure to rural counties, small urban areas, and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs). A key feature includes placing at least one station at or near every county seat not already served by an interstate station, ensuring comprehensive geographic coverage, and tallying up to an additional 190 stations. These are expected to be built following the completion of all phase 1 stations.

For context, most low to mid-range EVs can travel 120–200 miles on an 80% charge. With stations spaced no more than 70 miles apart, Texans will be able to confidently traverse the state with minimal risk of running out of charge — a major step forward in making electric transportation practical across Texas.

Ten NEVI charging stations now operational in Texas

The first three NEVI charging stations in Texas were unveiled in December of 2024, and there are now 10 operational stations as of September 2025! For 15 more stations, construction is already underway or will begin shortly; at least eight new stations are expected to be completed and operational by the end of 2025. In addition, there are 44 stations currently in the planning stage. See below for a full list of open and under construction stations.

Since the 2020 fiscal year, the number of electric vehicles registered in Texas have increased by more than 9 times, increasing by 805% from 36,418 to 329,642. By 2028, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimates that there will be 1 million EVs on Texas roads. With electric vehicle adoption rates rapidly rising, accommodating the increasing demand is imperative.

,American Energy,2025-10-11 00:18:31+00:00,Heatmap News,The Fiscal Contradictions of Trump's Energy Policy - Heatmap News,Emily Pontecorvo,,,,,https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-energy-contradictions,"The Department of Energy justified terminating hundreds of congressionally-mandated grants issued by the Biden administration for clean energy projects last week (including for a backup battery at a children’s hospital) by arguing that they were bad investments for the American people.
The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation.
Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain.
The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability.
In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing.","The Department of Energy justified terminating hundreds of congressionally-mandated grants issued by the Biden administration for clean energy projects last week (including for a backup battery at a children’s hospital) by arguing that they were bad investments for the American people.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency’s press release said.

It’s puzzling, then, that the Trump administration is pouring vast government resources into saving aging coal plants and expediting advanced nuclear projects — two sources of energy that are famously financial black holes.

The Energy Department announced it would invest $625 million to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” in late September. Earlier this year, the agency also made $900 million available to “unlock commercial deployment of American-made small modular reactors.”

It’s hard to imagine what economic yardsticks would warrant funding to keep coal plants open. The cost of operating a coal plant in the U.S. has increased by nearly 30% since 2021 — faster than inflation — according to research by Energy Innovation. Driving that increase is the cost of coal itself, as well as the fact that the nation’s coal plants are simply getting very old and more expensive to maintain. “You can put all the money you want into a clunker, but at the end of the day, it’s really old, and it’s just going to keep getting more expensive over time, even if you have a short term fix,” Michelle Solomon, a program manager at Energy Innovation who authored the research, told me.

Keeping these plants online — even if they only operate some of the time— inevitably raises electricity bills. That’s because in many of the country’s electricity markets, the cost of power on any given day is determined by the most expensive plant running. On a hot summer day when everyone’s air conditioners are working hard and the grid operator has to tell a coal plant to switch on to meet demand, every electron delivered in the region will suddenly cost the same as coal, even if it was generated essentially for free by the sun or wind.

The Trump administration has also based its support for coal plants on the idea that they are needed for reliability. In theory, coal generation should be available around the clock. But in reality, the plants aren’t necessarily up to the task — and not just because they’re old. Sandy Creek in Texas, which began operating in 2013 and is the newest coal plant in the country, experienced a major failure this past April and is now expected to stay offline until 2027, according to the region’s grid operator. In a report last year, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation warned that outage rates for coal plants are increasing. This is in part due to wear and tear from the way these plants cycle on and off to accommodate renewable energy sources, the report said, but it’s also due to reduced maintenance as plant operators plan to retire the facilities.

“You can do the deferred maintenance. It might keep the plant operating for a bit longer, but at the end of the day, it’s still not going to be the most efficient source of energy, or the cheapest source of energy,” Solomon said.

The contradictions snowball from there. On September 30, the DOE opened a $525 million funding opportunity for coal plants titled “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” inviting coal-fired power plants that are scheduled for retirement before 2032 or in rural areas to apply for grants that will help keep them open. The grant paperwork states that grid capacity challenges “are especially acute in regions with constrained transmission and sustained load growth.” Two days later, however, as part of the agency’s mass termination of grants, it canceled more than $1.3 billion in awards from the Grid Deployment Office to upgrade and install new transmission lines to ease those constraints.

The new funding opportunity may ultimately just shuffle awards around from one coal plant to another, or put previously-awarded projects through the time-and-money-intensive process of reapplying for the same funding under a new name. Up to $350 million of the total will go to as many as five coal plants, with initial funding to restart closed plants or to modernize old ones, and later phases designated for carbon capture, utilization, and storage retrofits. The agency said it will use “unobligated” money from three programs that were part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: the Carbon Capture Demonstration Projects Program, the Carbon Capture Large-Scale Pilot Projects, and the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program.

In a seeming act of cognitive dissonance, however, the agency has canceled awards for two coal-fired power plants that the Biden administration made under those same programs. One, a $6.5 million grant to Navajo Transitional Energy Company, a tribal-owned entity that owns a stake in New Mexico’s Four Corners Generating Station, would have funded a study to determine whether adding carbon capture and storage to the plant was economically viable. The other, a $50 million grant to TDA Research that would have helped the company validate its CCS technology at Dry Fork Station, a coal plant in Wyoming, was terminated in May.

Two more may be out the window. A new internal agency list of grants labeled “terminate” that circulated this week included an $8 million grant for the utility Duke Energy to evaluate the feasibility of capturing carbon from its Edwardsport plant in Indiana, and $350 million for Project Tundra, a carbon capture demonstration project at the Milton R. Young Station in North Dakota.

“It’s not internally consistent,” Jack Andreason Cavanaugh, a global fellow at the Columbia University’s Carbon Management Research Initiative, told me. “You’re canceling coal grants, but then you’re giving $630 million to keep them open. You’re also investing a ton of time and money into nuclear — which is great, to be clear — but these small modular reactors haven’t been deployed in the United States, and part of the reason is that they’re currently not economically viable.”

The closest any company has come thus far to deploying a small modular reactor in the U.S. is NuScale, a company that planned to build its first-of-a-kind reactors in Idaho and had secured agreements to sell the power to a group of public utilities in Utah. But between 2015, when it was first proposed, and late 2023, when it died, the project’s budget tripled from $3 billion to more than $9 billion, while its scale was reduced from 600 megawatts to 462 megawatts. Not all of that was inevitable — costs rose dramatically in the final few years due to inflation. The reason NuScale ultimately pulled out of the project is that the cost of electricity it generated was going to be too high for the market to bear.

It’s unclear how heavily the DOE will weigh project financials in the application process for the $900 million for nuclear reactors. In its funding announcement, it specified that the awards would be made “solely based on technical merit.” The agency’s official solicitation paperwork, however, names “financial viability” as one of the key review criteria. Regardless, the Trump administration appears to recognize the value in funding first-of-a-kind, risky technologies when it comes to nuclear, but is not applying the same standards to direct air capture or hydrogen plants.

I asked the Department of Energy to share the criteria it used in the project review process to determine economic viability. In response, spokesperson Ben Dietderich encouraged me to read Wright’s memorandum describing the review process from May. The memo outlines what types of documentation the agency will evaluate to reach a decision, but not the criteria for making that decision.

Solomon agreed that advanced nuclear might one day meet the grid’s growing power needs, but not anytime soon. “Hopefully in the long term, this technology does become a part of our electricity system. But certainly relying on it in the short term has real risks to electricity costs,” she said. “And also reliability, in the sense that the projects might not materialize.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTczMTAzNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzU1MjA2OH0.MQk2floJC0HebPHKp-gujW4uQNvrZXpP7vLup0F3ms4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-10 23:00:06.172299

A solar generator operates by using solar panels to convert sunlight into direct current (DC) electricity. The energy is stored in a high-capacity battery, with a charge controller managing the flow. An inverter then converts the stored DC power into alternating current (AC) for use with standard appliances.

This technology produces clean energy without emitting pollutants. It supports sustainable living practices and lessens reliance on the traditional power grid. For families aiming for more self-sufficiency, these systems offer energy independence and a reduced environmental footprint.

Unlike traditional generators that have ongoing fuel expenses, a solar generator can offer long-term savings. With fewer moving parts than conventional systems, they require less maintenance. This design results in lower operational costs and helps ensure the system is ready when needed.

The practical capability of these units is shown in their emergency performance. For instance, a 2,000Wh unit can theoretically power a 100W device for approximately 20 hours, depending on factors such as battery type and efficiency. This capacity can sustain appliances like refrigerators and communication tools during a grid interruption.

Solar Emergency Charger provides homeowners with reliable and user-friendly solar power stations. The company serves as a resource for families looking to add a modern, sustainable energy source to their preparedness plans.

Stevenson, Carlos Anchondo, Scott Waldman, Heather Richards, Benjamin Storrow",,,,,https://www.eenews.net/articles/blm-cancels-largest-solar-project-in-north-america/,"They predicted the Esmeralda 7 project — by far the largest solar project that had moved through the permitting process under former President Joe Biden’s Interior Department — won’t be the last major project in the pipeline to be pulled.
The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada.
That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.
It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands.
Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.","The Trump administration’s cancellation of what would have been one of the world’s largest solar power projects has some industry observers fretting over the future of renewable energy on public lands.

They predicted the Esmeralda 7 project — by far the largest solar project that had moved through the permitting process under former President Joe Biden’s Interior Department — won’t be the last major project in the pipeline to be pulled. It was one of a number of Nevada desert solar projects that had been steadily advancing through regulatory review by the Biden administration.

Scott Sklar, sustainable energy director at George Washington University’s Environment & Energy Management Institute, said the Trump administration had set up a “multitude of regulatory barriers and delays.” These delays, he added, have placed financial strain on the renewable energy companies with projects waiting for review and could lead to others walking away from pending projects.

“The administration wants to stop these projects, period, so there is no chance for approval,” he said.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, agreed. “As the Trump administration continues to take actions hostile to renewable energy projects, that may not be the last solar project on federal land to cancel,” he said.

The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 project to note that the environmental review of the project was “cancelled.”

The decision to cancel the programmatic environmental impact statement was described by a federal government official with knowledge of the situation, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, as a mutual decision by BLM and the handful of companies that had proposed the seven individual solar power projects that would have comprised Esmeralda 7.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

Representatives with the energy companies involved in developing the seven individual solar power plants that collectively comprised the Esmeralda 7 project did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration has made its skepticism of the solar build-out in Nevada clear in recent months, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other officials saying solar is an “intermittent” technology that doesn’t provide reliable energy. But some conservationists alarmed by the proposed rollout of large solar projects in Nevada and other Western states celebrated the demise of Esmeralda 7, saying as designed it took up up far too much land.

“Friends of Nevada Wilderness is thrilled that this poorly sited project is dead,” said Shaaron Netherton, the group’s executive director.

“In the push to get this particular project through, the BLM ignored the importance of this region’s cultural significance, biological significance and the fact that it is one of the most intact landscapes remaining in Nevada,” Netherton added.

BLM in July 2024 issued a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project and had originally planned to issue a final review document in April.

Around 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under at least preliminary review by BLM when President Donald Trump took office still await action.

That includes final environmental reviews for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.

What’s more, two major solar projects that were issued records of decision in the final weeks of the Biden administration have since sat in limbo — the Jove Solar Project in southwest Arizona and the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project in southern Nevada, with a combined capacity to power 350,000 homes.

Burgum and his department have increasingly tightened the restrictions on solar and wind projects. Burgum signed a secretarial order that directed officials to eliminate policies granting “preferential treatment” for wind and solar development on federal lands and waters. The department also issued guidance to agency leaders that Burgum and Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor would need to review a long list of procedural decisions for those projects.

Burgum in August also signed an order that requires Interior to consider “capacity density” when evaluating solar and wind projects, which could hinder them because they tend to take up more land than other kinds of energy development.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in an email Friday that the industry needs “further clarity from BLM on its apparent decision to abruptly cancel these solar projects in the late stages of the review process,” but that they “remain deeply concerned” about the administration’s recent actions that appear aimed at slowing solar development on federal lands.

“We need more power on the grid, fast, and the solar and storage industry is ready to provide it,” Norris said, “but we need the administration to get serious about truly achieving American energy dominance.”

Concerns about project’s size

The Esmeralda 7 project was ambitious by most any measure.

It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands. If built as imagined, it could have produced about 5,350 MW of electricity — enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.

On the surface, at least, the project appeared to be proposed in an ideal spot in Esmeralda County.

The federal government controls 98 percent of the county’s 2.2 million acres, and BLM accounts for the vast majority of that — managing 2.1 million acres there.

There’s not a single incorporated town, and only about 729 residents, ranking it among the 20 least populated counties in the nation, with the nation’s second-lowest population density of residents per square mile.

But the project had garnered concerns about its sheer size and the potential for it to disturb migratory patterns for wildlife.

Conservation advocates, local government leaders and nearby residents have expressed concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Esmeralda 7 project, which in addition to covering a huge swath of desert lands would have also included miles of roads and associated transmission lines.

They have argued for placing onshore utility-scale projects on previously disturbed sites and expanding the use of rooftop solar.

The Esmeralda 7 project “would have destroyed significant archaeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands,” said Kevin Emmerich, a co-founder of Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch.

The cancellation of the project “will give us a chance to protect the tremendous resources of the area, including beautiful and wild mountain ranges and valleys, rare plant populations, and bighorn sheep,” said Laura Cunningham, a biologist with Western Watersheds Project.

“Paleontological fossil beds [the Esmeralda Formation] here were formative to understanding the geological history of the Great Basin,” Cunningham added. “This is good news for recreationists and for conservation efforts of an amazing landscape.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/4a/db/0757e1e94a558b25616284763f8a/29730315801-859a5b0540-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 21:01:08.001022

The 11 states leading the effort announced October 10 are co-chairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Wyoming, and participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and West Virginia.

“The new Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative is critical to moving new nuclear projects forward across the country,” said David Terry, NASEO President. “The initiative is among the most important actions taken collectively by states to date to catalyze investment in historic levels of firm, clean electric power development to serve consumers, businesses and the nation as a whole for decades to come.”

NASEO last month issued a Request for Information to provide states with information on a structure for an advanced nuclear project “order book” strategy, including the status and use cases for different nuclear technologies, and investment and coordination models.

The order book approach moves away from one-off projects to propel widespread market adoption of the most viable technologies that can be deployed across multiple states. This includes assessing the readiness of different advanced reactor designs to meet different power needs identified by states, which will speed project development and lower costs. NASEO, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the U.S. Department of Energy Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear coordinated with the states to advance the RFI.

A cornerstone of the overall First Mover initiative is forming public-private partnerships with interested utilities, nuclear technology developers, project developers, energy end-users (e.g., consumers, data centers, manufacturers), investors and others. NASEO and the First Mover states are working with the U.S. Department of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Congress to accelerate advanced nuclear projects.

About the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative

The First Mover initiative, directed by state energy offices, is led by state co-chairs New York, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Wyoming, and participating states Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia. The governors of these states are committed to delivering advanced nuclear power rapidly, safely, and cost-effectively to ensure consumers and businesses have reliable, affordable, sustainable electricity for years to come.

These states seek to accelerate advanced nuclear projects by reducing financial and technology risks, devising supportive market adoption policies, defining supply chain needs, streamlining federal permitting, developing coordinated procurement options, exploring state-federal-private financing structures, and creating public-private partnerships.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced New York’s participation in the initiative during her “State of the State Address” in January. “New York is proud to co-lead the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, which demonstrates our commitment to the exploration of innovative technologies to achieve a reliable and affordable electric system for New York families,” Hochul said. “New York looks forward to partnering with other states that want to find ways to meet growing energy demand, pursue economic development opportunities, and who share the same vision for a sustainable energy future.”

“The state of Indiana is committed to identifying the strongest pathways for advancing new nuclear projects,” said Indiana Gov. Mike Braun. “By co-leading the Advanced Nuclear First Mover Initiative, Indiana will be able to facilitate innovative new partnerships across states and industry, identify supportive policy mechanisms, and develop new tools for decreasing project risk.”

The legislation, co-sponsored by the California Professional Firefighters and the California State Association of Electrical Workers, is aimed at strengthening coordination with fire authorities and preventing safety incidents.
It is introduced in the aftermath of a major fire at the Moss Landing battery storage facility in Monterey County.
“California must prioritize safety at every step when expanding battery storage to meet its clean energy goals,” said Senator Laird.","Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 283, authored by Senator John Laird, introducing new safety requirements for the development of battery energy storage systems (BESS) in California. While the bill enhances oversight and safety, it is also expected to increase the cost of battery storage development in the state.

The legislation, co-sponsored by the California Professional Firefighters and the California State Association of Electrical Workers, is aimed at strengthening coordination with fire authorities and preventing safety incidents. It is introduced in the aftermath of a major fire at the Moss Landing battery storage facility in Monterey County.

The site, part of the Vistra Power Plant, is the largest operational battery project in the United States.. The fire at a 300 MW lithium-ion storage system triggered the evacuation of more than 1,200 residents and led to the temporary closure of surrounding roads. While all on-site personnel were safely evacuated and no injuries were reported, the event raised significant concerns about the safety of large-scale energy storage facilities.

“California must prioritize safety at every step when expanding battery storage to meet its clean energy goals,” said Senator Laird. “SB 283 ensures that future battery storage facilities are developed with safety and the community in mind, and that our fire officials are involved in every step along the way. I thank Governor Newsom for signing this bill to protect first responders, local communities, and the integrity of our renewable energy transition.”

Under SB 283, battery storage developers will be required to meet with the local fire authority at least 30 days prior to submitting an application for a new project. This consultation must cover key safety aspects, including facility design, risk assessments, and emergency response planning, in alignment with requirements under SB 38. In addition, developers will be required to arrange and pay for a post-installation inspection of the facility by the local fire authority before the system is allowed to begin operation.

The bill also directs the state to review building standards related to battery storage. As part of the next update to the California Building Standards Code after July 1, 2026, the Office of the State Fire Marshal will be required to evaluate and potentially propose siting restrictions. This may include limiting installations to dedicated-use, noncombustible buildings or outdoor locations to reduce fire risk.

Initially, SB 283 included a provision requiring battery storage projects to comply with the National Fire Protection Association’s NFPA 855 standards. However, this requirement was removed from the final bill after the Office of the State Fire Marshal independently adopted the latest NFPA 855 standards in March 2025. These standards are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2026, making further legislation on the matter unnecessary.

“Senate Bill 283 is a critical step forward in protecting both our firefighters and the communities they serve,” said Brian K. Rice, president of the California Professional Firefighters. “By strengthening safety standards for battery storage facilities and ensuring local fire authorities have a seat at the table through the meet-and-confer process, this law puts responsibility where it belongs — on the owners and operators of these facilities — and helps prevent disasters before they start.”

According to a release from Prometheus, the project is expected to include a minimum of $500 million in initial investment and to deliver up to 1.5 gigawatts of IT-ready capacity over multiple phases.

First IT-ready power is targeted for 2026.

Project Overview

The Casper project and strategic partnership are designed to meet accelerating demand for AI compute capacity while embedding carbon removal into the project’s core. It unifies three pillars:

Data Infrastructure: Prometheus Hyperscale will design and finance high-density compute halls using proprietary aquifer, non-consumptive water-cooling systems to maximize energy efficiency.

Energy Systems: Spiritus builds on its work in Wyoming with its new platform, Orchard Power, which will deliver 1.5 GW of on-site firm power fueled by natural gas, integrated point-source and direct air capture to drive fast, affordable, carbon-negative operations.

Carbon Sequestration: Casper Carbon Capture will provide land, rights-of-way and access to permitted CO2 sequestration wells in Natrona and Converse counties, ensuring permanent storage of captured emissions.

This new data center development builds on Prometheus’s initiatives in Wyoming and Texas. In Evanston is the company’s flagship project: scaling toward 1 GW+ IT capacity, with partnerships for low-carbon natural gas, nuclear SMR power and organic flow battery systems.

In Texas are partnerships with ENGIE North America and Conduit Power to co-locate AI data centers alongside renewable and hybrid power systems across the Interstate 35 corridor.

The project is expected to generate hundreds of construction jobs during the building phase and dozens of long-term technical positions upon completion. The project will also expand the tax base by generating new property, utility and infrastructure revenues for Natrona and Converse counties.

“We’re excited to develop another project in Wyoming,” Prometheus CEO Trenton Thornock said in the release. “The Casper project and this partnership with Spiritus and Casper Carbon Capture further enables Prometheus’ vision of developing the future of digital infrastructure sustainably.”

(WSAV) — State leaders are looking for new ways to keep electric vehicle (EV) interest charged up — after federal tax credits for EV buyers expired at the end of September.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, created under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,’ had offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. But a bill signed in July shortened its end date from 2032 to September 30, 2025, effectively ending the incentive early.

‘Range Anxiety’ No Longer a Major Issue

EV owners say Georgia’s expanding charging infrastructure is helping ease common concerns about long-distance travel.

“The charging network in Georgia is really being built out in a very robust and easy way,” said James Marlow, President of Southface and an EV owner. “When I drive to the Georgia coast, it’s no problem to stop, charge, and grab food or coffee. Charging is becoming much less of an issue.”

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Georgia now has over 90,000 registered EVs and about 2,200 charging stationsstatewide.

Local Incentives May Be the Next Step

With federal credits now gone, experts say car manufacturers and local governments may need to step in with new incentives to keep buyers interested.

“The withdrawal of incentives has definitely changed the market,” Marlow said. “But if you zoom out, electric vehicles now make up about 10% of the U.S. new car market — and that’s growing.”

He also pointed to falling battery costs, which are expected to make EVs more affordable in the coming years.

Cheaper to Operate, Easier to Charge

“I have a Tesla 3, and a full charge to 80% costs me about $12,” Marlow said. “That’s compared to nearly $60 for a full tank of gas in my Jeep — so it’s cheaper to operate.”

The Georgia Department of Transportation is currently reviewing roadways to identify potential “charging deserts” and plans to expand access across rural and suburban areas.

The ‘Battery Belt of the South’

Governor Brian Kemp has called Georgia the ‘Battery Belt of the South’— as major EV manufacturers like SK Battery, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai continue to expand operations in the state.

With production booming and infrastructure growing, policymakers hope that even without federal incentives, Georgia can remain a leader in America’s electric vehicle future.

September was a solid sales month as many consumers headed to dealer lots before EV tax credits expired on Sept. 30. Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales hit an all-time high in market share and accounted for 11.8% of all new vehicles sold. This market share was up nearly two percentage points from August 2025, which was also a strong month for BEV sales.

Year-to-date, BEV sales accounted for 8.4% of all new vehicles sold, an increase of 0.7 percentage points compared to the same period last year. And for third-quarter 2025, BEV sales increased 24.1% year over year. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicles, which were also eligible for the tax credits, didn’t perform nearly as well as BEVs. PHEV sales in September 2025 accounted for just 1.7% of all new vehicles sold, which is right in line with their year-to-date market share of 1.8%.

The average discount on a new vehicle increased slightly from August to September. According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per unit should totaled $3,116, up just $24 compared to August 2025. J.D. Power notes that more incentive spending was targeted at EVs. Expressed as a share of the average MSRP, overall incentive spending is expected to be 6.1%, while incentive spending for non-EVs should reach just 4.8%.

New light-vehicle inventory on the ground and in-transit totaled 2.65 million units at the end of September 2025, up by 6.2% compared to August 2025 but down 5.9% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect inventory levels to end the year slightly below their levels at the end of Q3.

New light-vehicle sales have been solid so far through the third quarter, with a year-to-date SAAR of 16.4 million units—an increase of 4.7% year over year. NADA stated it believes there has been some significant pull-ahead volume, as consumers rushed to dealer lots earlier in the year before tariffs took effect and in recent months as consumers purchased EVs before the end of tax credits.

The big question now: Will volume hold in the final quarter of the year and into next year as 2026 models arrive on dealer lots? NADA has already seen several OEMs release price increases in the mid-single-digit percentage range for 2026 models, and NADA is watching closely to see how much—and when—OEMs will pass along tariff-related price increases.

My Thoughts on President Trump's Phase 1 Gaza Peace Deal

President Trump and Secretary Rubio announced a historic peace deal in the Middle East this week, and I am in full support. Hamas' unprovoked and brutal attack on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 and kidnapping over 250 innocent people, was pure evil. Now we must ensure the beginnings of this historic Gaza peace deal are fully upheld and all hostages are safely returned home to their families.

Israel, under Prime Minister Netanyahu, has shown tremendous resilience in dismantling Hamas's terror network. This deal offers a path forward, but only if Hamas honors its commitments. We remain vigilant and eager to see this agreement implemented completely.

President Trump and Secretary Rubio's continued leadership is essential to ensuring lasting peace and the safe return of all the innocent people still held captive.

Midland Airpark Mineral Rights

This week, I joined City of Midland Mayor Lori Blong for a press conference to discuss an ongoing mineral rights issue negatively impacting the city of Midland and its taxpayers and outline a plan to address it.

For background, Midland stands to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in mineral revenues from oil and gas production beneath Midland Airpark, and it's only right that those dollars benefit the taxpayers who live here. However, under the current law, these dollars are tied up in a maze of federal rules and red tape.

This is not a fair deal for the Permian Basin. Midland taxpayers should be the ones who benefit from what's beneath their feet, not the federal government. I remain committed to standing up for American energy, and this is another chapter in ensuring the hard work of the Permian Basin, and especially Midland, stays here.

FDA Quietly Approves Generic Abortion Drug

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of a new generic version of the chemical abortion drug mifepristone. Not only is this deeply concerning, but this new version was approved under the same weakened standards the previous administration applied to mifepristone, which removed critical safeguards designed to protect women’s health and safety.

Mifepristone has a well-documented record of serious medical complications, with countless women suffering severe health consequences or even losing their lives. Compounding these risks, some abusers and human traffickers have taken advantage of these lowered standards and mail-order access to obtain the pills without medical oversight or verification, in some cases giving them to women without their knowledge or consent.

Approving this generic version under these same reckless standards only expands these dangers and puts more women and their unborn children at risk. I remain committed to protecting life, defending women’s health and safety, and ensuring HHS Secretary Kennedy remains committed to restoring safeguards on these dangerous abortion drugs.

Congress is now considering overturning management plans in other states, too.","Congress has voted to overturn part of the federal management plans for millions of acres of BLM lands in eastern Montana.

The Bureau of Land Management’s Miles City Field Office manages almost 3 million acres of public lands. That’s just on the surface. The office is also responsible for more than 12 million acres below ground in mineral rights.

In 2024, the Miles City Field Office decided to stop selling new coal leases. The agency at that time cited declining demands for coal, and the goal of reducing planet-warming emissions

But Wednesday, the U.S. Senate concurred with a previous House vote to overturn that policy, as part of President Donald Trump’s push to revive fossil fuel power. Montana’s Republican Congressional delegation all voted in favor of the change. U.S. Sen. Steve Daines was critical of the field office’s 2024 decision.

""This means that the BLM prohibited all new coal leasing in the Powder River Basin. By the way, that is the home of the largest coal reserves in the United States,"" Daines said.

Active mines in the region with existing coal leases would not have been impacted.

Resource Management Plans guide how BLM lands are used and managed. They are drafted using feedback from all the people that use these lands. The development of the Miles City plan involved mineral owners, natural resource industry groups, landowners, ranchers, farmers, hunters and 17 tribal nations.

Jeanie Alderson was directly involved with developing the 2024 plan. She’s a sixth-generation rancher in southeastern Montana, and the BLM owns mineral rights under her land. Alderson says this change overrides local voices.

""To have all those years of all of us working on this – it's the best of our, sort of, democratic process, and with people who have to live with the results and the actions. But to have it done from Washington, D.C., just foisted on us, is really unfortunate.""

The BLM’s statement: “During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

The “Cancelled – Cancelled” notice on BLM’s NEPA website applies only to the environmental review stage. The entire project has not been canceled. The original story appears below. The headline has been updated.

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A cluster of seven solar projects that would have produced enough electricity to power roughly 1.6 million average homes was canceled without explanation on Friday.

The Esmeralda Seven Solar Project, located west of Tonopah in sparsely populated Esmeralda County, now carries the note “Cancelled – Cancelled” next to its status on the Bureau of Land Management’s National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) register.

The collective output of Esmeralda Seven would have been 6.2 gigawatts of electric power. Three of the seven projects made a list of the five largest proposed solar farms in June 2024. That list of proposed projects was based on data from Global Energy Monitor, which tracks power projects of all kinds worldwide.

The seven individual projects: Gold Dust Solar, Smoky Valley Solar, Esmeralda Energy Center, Lone Mountain Solar, Nivloc Solar, Red Ridge 1 and Red Ridge 2.

The area is about 270 miles northwest of Las Vegas on U.S. 95.

As approval for renewable energy was fast-tracked under President Joe Biden, environmental reviews for the seven projects were combined and the cluster became known as Esmeralda Seven.

President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to end policies that favored solar and wind projects, making oil, gas and even coal his priorities for American energy development. BLM is one of the agencies under the Interior Department, led by Doug Burgum.

A post by the Nevada Republican Party on X Friday afternoon said: “Esmeralda County voters turned out for Trump, and now he has listened to them and cancelled the Esmeralda7 solar scam. Another phenomenal win by @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryBurgum“

8 News Now has reached out to BLM for comment.

Environmental groups including Friends of Nevada Wilderness, Conservation Lands Foundation, Center for Biological Diversity, the Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife, the Walker River Paiute Tribe and the Yerington Paiute Tribe, and the Coalition for Nevada’s Wildlife had argued against the Esmeralda Seven project.

Another conservation group, Basin and Range Watch, sent a statement when the project’s status changed to canceled.

“The E7 projects would have destroyed significant archeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands. This news is a welcome relief and gives hope that the area could be protected for the long term in the future,” Kevin Emmerick, the group’s co-founder, said in an email.

Shaaron Netherton, executive director of Friends of Nevada Wilderness, spoke to 8 News Now last year about serious concerns about the proposal. Among those concerns: nationally significant cultural resources and impacts and impacts on the state’s most genetically pure population of native desert bighorn sheep.

“There are over 400 Paleoindian sites in this area. They are 10-14,000 years old,” Netherton said.

Conservation groups generally support renewable energy over fossil fuels, but concerns often arise over conflicts at targeted locations.",https://www.8newsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2025/07/solar-panels-e1752866077410.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-10 23:00:16.400418

In some cases, the award amounts given in the leaked document assume planned future federal funding, spending that had not yet been obligated.
Still, clean energy advocates warned that the administration’s latest moves would have widespread economic and environmental costs.
“So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness and clean energy, no matter which way you slice it,” Hoover said.
The DOE’s move to terminate funds that had already been obligated is also likely to face challenges from recipients and clean energy advocates.","Just days after announcing sweeping cuts to clean energy programs across the country, the Trump administration appears to be upping the ante—potentially clawing back billions more in federal funding.

The U.S. Department of Energy initially announced the termination of 321 financial awards on Oct. 2, which the agency said totaled $7.56 billion in taxpayer savings. An additional 327 awards appear on a new, leaked list of projects targeted by the DOE for termination, widely circulated this week among lobbyists, members of Congress and news outlets including Inside Climate News.

The cancellation of all these projects would gut the big federal push in clean energy made under the Biden administration, and experts warned of wide-ranging impacts to jobs, electricity grids stressed by rising demand and the environment. But the tides of economics—in particular the plummeting cost of wind and solar power—mean that renewable energy will likely continue to gain ground. Indeed, some recipients of the targeted projects have vowed to continue with their work, though scale and speed may suffer.

What’s more, an ICN analysis of federal spending data, based on a spreadsheet derived from the leaked document created by the Clean Air Task Force, indicates that the DOE’s estimate of taxpayer savings is overstated. The original 321 canceled awards include many that had already passed their stated end date—two dozen of them before Trump’s inauguration.

Considering only those awards that were still current at the time the government shutdown on Oct. 1, and subtracting funds already sent to the recipients, ICN calculated a potential cut of around $4.87 billion from the terminations announced on Oct. 2.

DOE did not respond to ICN’s questions on where its additional $2.7 billion in savings came from, and said that it could not verify the lists of targeted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” said agency spokesperson Ben Dietderich. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

The cancellations announced on Oct. 2 largely targeted projects in blue states, prompting fierce criticism from Democrats and accusations that the administration was wielding the cuts as a political weapon amid the federal government shutdown.

“This is a shameless and vindictive attack by [Office of Management and Budget] Director Vought, which will eliminate jobs and raise energy costs for Americans across the country,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) in a statement.

But as the government shutdown stretched into its second week, news that the Trump administration was considering even more drastic cuts began to spread on Capitol Hill.

The leaked list of targeted awards contains all of those covered by the DOE’s initial announcement. Across the additional 327 awards, annotations in the document indicate total award amounts of $15.83 billion.

But again, the potential for immediate taxpayer savings if all these projects are abruptly terminated is markedly smaller.

After excluding grants past their end dates and subtracting money already sent to the recipients, ICN calculated potential cuts of $7.84 billion based on awards that had been obligated to receive funding.

In some cases, the award amounts given in the leaked document assume planned future federal funding, spending that had not yet been obligated. For instance, the document notes an amount of $1.2 billion to establish a series of hydrogen production facilities along the Gulf Coast of Texas.

However, only around $22 million in funding had been awarded so far for planning, analysis and design activities. Some $1.2 million of this has already been sent to HyVelocity, the consortium behind the effort.

This project is one of seven hydrogen hubs appropriated $8 billion through the 2026 fiscal year under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021.

Some of the projects covered by the Oct. 2 announcement and among the additional list of targeted projects in the leaked document had already been terminated in May. They include a grant of more than $86 million to Sublime Systems of Somerville, Massachusetts, to create a low-carbon cement factory and a project to replace the use of natural gas with hydrogen at an ExxonMobil plant in Texas that had been awarded more than $330 million, most of which had not yet been sent.

Still, clean energy advocates warned that the administration’s latest moves would have widespread economic and environmental costs.

“There will be job losses in local communities. There will be less reliable electricity grids,” said Zealan Hoover, former senior advisor to the EPA administrator during the Biden administration.

“Federal dollars are designed to solve investment gaps where private capital does not flow,” Hoover said. “So my expectation is that if these grants are terminated, then that work will either not progress, it will progress significantly slower or other sources of public investment at the state and local level or social investment will need to be redirected—but then that comes at the cost of investment that’s not happening elsewhere.”

Because many of the grants aim to catalyze new technologies, cutting them also harms the country’s ability to keep pace with China and other nations, he added.

“So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness and clean energy, no matter which way you slice it,” Hoover said.

Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit that promotes climate solutions and reducing air pollution, said he was most concerned about cuts to projects intended to develop new technologies and demonstrate their commercial viability. “With respect to some of these emerging technologies that require the demonstrations, that’s what we would say would be the hammer blow,” he said.

These projects include initial work for the hydrogen hubs championed by the Biden administration as “critical energy infrastructure” that would create jobs and spur investment in technology to power hard-to-decarbonize sectors like heavy industry and long-haul trucking. Two of those hubs, MACH2 and ARCH2, would be located in part in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.

The hubs have bipartisan support in the state. Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed them as a “win for the Commonwealth,” while Republican state Sen. Gene Yaw announced he was “delighted” by the investment when it was first announced and looked forward to “working cooperatively” with the federal government and businesses to realize the projects’ full potential. Just last week, MACH2’s chief operating officer, Manny Citron, told WHYY that Republican Sen. Dave McCormick’s staff had been “incredibly supportive” of the hub.

Andrew Cottone, founder of one of MACH2’s anchor partners, Aternium, said he had not been notified of any changes in the funding status of the hub. Either way, Aternium will move forward with its plans for building hydrogen production facilities in the mid-Atlantic region, he said.

“It’s full steam ahead for us,” he said. “We would love a strong ecosystem, but we’ve launched this company with a responsible business model. We are viable with or without tax credits. We are viable with or without the Department of Energy hub system.”

Others involved in the leadership of the MACH2 and ARCH2 hubs did not respond to requests for comment. It is unclear whether the projects can survive without federal government support.

Part of the problem is that potential agreements with steel and iron companies to use the fuel produced by the hubs did not end up moving forward, said Hilary Lewis, steel director at the nonprofit Industrious Labs, which works to decarbonize industry. The steel and iron industries contribute about 11 percent of global carbon emissions.

“We would have liked to see companies like U.S. Steel really invested in the hydrogen hub process,” she said.

The federal government has long played a key role in technological advances. Lewis said Biden-era tax credits, the hydrogen hubs and other federal investments in making green steel were all “great examples” of supporting clean energy solutions for industry.

“But when the government backtracks on its promises and cancels this type of funding, it puts American competitiveness at risk,” she said. “We are ceding leadership to other countries that are going to make these investments.”

Inside Climate News obtained a copy of the termination letter sent by the DOE to one of the grant recipients targeted in its initial announcement.

In the letter, dated Oct. 1, the agency said the recipient’s award was reviewed in a Portfolio Review Process (PRP) to ensure that the funding was “financially sound and economically viable, aligned with national and economic security interests, and consistent with Federal law and this Administration’s policies and priorities and program goals and priorities.”

“DOE regrets to inform you that the subject [grant] did not pass Standards of the PRP Committee review and will not proceed,” the letter reads.

Not all of the recipients have received notice that funding is being cut off. A spokesperson for the California Energy Commission on Thursday said that it still hadn’t received any communication from DOE that a $630 million grant for improvements to the state’s electric grid had been canceled, despite appearing in the Oct. 2 list of terminated awards.

Other recipients, including Mercedes-Benz—awarded some $285 million for next generation all-electric van production—and the University of North Dakota, which had four awards in the leaked list of wider potential cuts, declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Neither Mercedes-Benz nor UND’s awards were included in the DOE’s initial terminations.

“The Trump administration and its allies are actively restricting the supply of affordable clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes.”

To some groups impacted by the DOE’s moves, the decision to terminate funding capped off a long period of uncertainty stretching to President Donald Trump’s first day back in office.

“[For] a lot of members of our team, there was a certain amount of relief when this finally happened, because the fact that this has been going on since January has been a challenge,” said Zora Chung, cofounder of ReJoule.

Chung’s company had been slated to receive $10 million in federal funding to support its efforts to repurpose electric vehicle batteries for energy storage in commercial buildings. The project also sought to advance opportunities for historically underrepresented workers and businesses, and contribute to widespread adoption of long-duration energy storage in the U.S. by 2030, according to the award description.

To Chung, the DOE’s decision to terminate ReJoule’s award doesn’t reflect the project’s potential to advance the agency’s core mission. “We still believe that the project is aligned with the DOE goals of energy independence and resilience, as well as competing directly with China on battery technology,” Chung said.

Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed.

“Canceling projects that would lower electric bills and make the grid more reliable is not about achieving ‘energy dominance,’” Slaney said, referring to one of Trump’s key priorities. “The Trump administration and its allies are actively restricting the supply of affordable clean power when demand is skyrocketing from data centers, industry and homes.”

Despite the loss of federal funding, Chung said that ReJoule’s battery project would move forward—slowed and scaled back, but undeterred.

“While the cancellation is certainly a setback for this specific deployment timeline—and a missed opportunity for accelerating American job creation and domestic energy security—it does not change our mission,” Chung said in a LinkedIn post confirming the award’s cancellation.

The DOE’s move to terminate funds that had already been obligated is also likely to face challenges from recipients and clean energy advocates. Chung, in her LinkedIn post, said that ReJoule would be formally reviewing its options, including appeal—while the California Energy Commission said that it “will evaluate options to appeal or reverse federal actions to cut previously allocated funds to these important programs.”

In its Oct. 2 announcement, the DOE claimed that the terminated projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

But the administration’s moves come as solar and wind power, in particular, are establishing themselves as the most economically competitive options for energy investment. On Tuesday, a report from the energy think tank Ember announced that renewables had for the first time surpassed coal in the global electricity mix. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s effort to lease rights to extract 167 million tons of coal on federal lands in Montana attracted just one bid, of $186,000.

According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy capacity is poised to more than double globally in the next five years, even as projections for the United States are revised down based on the Trump administration’s policies. Renewables are growing in countries like China, India, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia; Germany recently announced a $7 billion investment in industrial decarbonization.

Michael Noble, a Minnesota-based consultant to clean energy companies and a longtime advocate for the energy transition, said that wind, solar, batteries and related technologies are “all kick-ass technologies that are falling in price. Those fundamentals cannot be undone by politicians.”

The administration’s favoring of fossil fuels “is putting all of our money on a horse that’s already lost,” said Sachu Constantine, executive director of Vote Solar, a nonprofit based in San Francisco.

The momentum is unlikely to last. - Marketplace",Henry Epp,,,,,https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/10/evs-drive-strong-auto-sales-in-the-third-quarter-of-2025,"The U.S. automotive industry just had a strong quarter.
More than four million new vehicles were sold in July, August and September, according to estimates from Cox Automotive and Edmunds.
But that sales pace might be difficult to maintain as the industry faces growing headwinds from changing federal policies on electric vehicles and international trade.
The third quarter coincided with the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, causing a surge in EV sales that’s likely to be temporary.
But now that the credit’s gone, “we're absolutely going to see a massive drop in electric vehicle sales for the next few months,” predicted Brauer.","The U.S. automotive industry just had a strong quarter.

More than four million new vehicles were sold in July, August and September, according to estimates from Cox Automotive and Edmunds. That’s well above the same period last year, and puts the industry on track to sell over 16 million new vehicles this year, per Cox.

But that sales pace might be difficult to maintain as the industry faces growing headwinds from changing federal policies on electric vehicles and international trade. The third quarter coincided with the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for electric vehicles, causing a surge in EV sales that’s likely to be temporary.

That surge was apparent at Audi Oakland, where Daniel Kossut is general manager.

“We started August with over 75 EV units in stock, and we wrapped up September with only three left in stock,” Kossut said.

Kossut said his dealership marketed the end of the tax credit pretty heavily. But he also saw a lot of buyers who already knew they had a hard deadline to get that discount.

“They know what they're looking for. They're pretty savvy, and people knew this was it,” he said.

This EV sales rush ahead of the tax credit expiration is a classic example of a pull forward effect, said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at automotive information site iSeeCars.com.

“Anyone who was on the fence or seriously considering an electric vehicle purchase in the next three, six, nine months ran out and did it before the end of September,” he said.

So, those sales that might have otherwise occurred next January or April, happened in September instead. That pull forward made for the strongest quarterly EV sales in the U.S. on record: over 438,000 according to Cox Automotive.

But now that the credit’s gone, “we're absolutely going to see a massive drop in electric vehicle sales for the next few months,” predicted Brauer.

That drop could have an impact on overall car sales in the months ahead. Because, if you look beyond EVs, sales in the third quarter, especially September, were on the soft side, Brauer said.

“An increasing number of people can't afford new cars, or they're taking out loans they probably shouldn't be taking out,” he said.

Eighty-four-month loans (that’s seven years) are getting more popular. The average monthly payment on a new vehicle is nearly $750.

Pair those figures with low consumer sentiment, and it’s not hard to see why Brauer and other analysts don’t expect a huge rush to dealerships around the holidays this year.

At the same time, automakers are facing rising costs of their own from the Trump administration’s tariffs, which are steadily eating into their profits, according to Tyson Jominy, senior vice president of data and analytics at JD Power.

“We estimate it's about $40 billion of tariff costs that automakers are absorbing, and that is equivalent to nearly 40% of global profits in the auto industry last year,” Jominy said.

So far, carmakers are mostly choosing not to pass those costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Jominy said that’s partly because they’re in a competitive industry. Every automotive company has a different supply chain, and therefore a different level of exposure to tariffs.

“Just because you have that cost as an automaker for producing overseas doesn't mean your competitors do,” Jominy said. “That is leading to very competitive price dynamics here in the U.S.”

However, car companies probably can’t eat those costs forever, assuming the import taxes stay in place.

“We would suspect that once we get into the new calendar year, 2026, you'll see some increases in those stickers of the vehicles that are being delivered to dealer lots in time for the spring,” said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.

And the most affordable vehicles on the market, those under $30,000, are the most exposed to tariffs, Smoke said. That’s because they’re more likely to be assembled or include more parts from outside the U.S.

But hiking the cost of those cars, SUVs, and crossovers, “clearly challenges things for the consumer who's already stretching just to be able to afford a vehicle in that price point,” Smoke said.

The auto industry does have one bright spot to look forward to in the new year: Tax refunds. After the GOP tax bill passed over the summer, tax refunds for many Americans could be substantial, Smoke said.

“It's amazing what cash-in-pocket does to vehicle demand and activity.”

But until tax season, it could be a long winter at car dealerships.",https://img.apmcdn.org/e9d2ad83a0866c106ba74c482f924fad71b57d16/widescreen/06a365-20251010-cars-lined-up-in-a-dealership-parking-lot-2000.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:01:56.092424

That was the takeaway from a keynote presentation by Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois and Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May at the Tulane Business Forum on Friday. The LED chief argued that a series of major investments portend a new era of economic swagger for the state.

Before a crowd of about 500 at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center, Bourgeois pointed to the last 21 months of outside investment in Louisiana, led by the $10 billion Meta data center in north Louisiana and the nearly $6 billion Hyundai steel plant near Baton Rouge, and said it’s time for Louisianans to believe in the state’s prospects again.

“We've been working hard to change the narrative,” Bourgeois said. “There’s been this feeling that we’re not good enough. We want to change that.”

Bourgeois said 58 announced projects could lead to 70,000 new jobs and lend credibility to the state in the eyes of future investors.

Other big investments announced or expanded since Bourgeois took on the role of the state's biggest business booster in 2024 include LNG projects from Woodside Energy and Venture Global, plus the CF Industries “blue ammonia” plant in Ascension Parish. This week, Louisiana-based electrical contractor MMR announced a $55 million expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in Lafayette Parish.

“We’re leveraging the state’s existing strengths in energy with new twists,” Bourgeois said.

Bourgeois said the Meta data center is creating opportunities for existing businesses, like Monroe-based wholesaler Robertson Produce, which just landed a large contract to help feed hundreds of construction workers.

Experts talk coffee, AI and music business

The comments from Bourgeois and May were part of a half-day business forum organized by the Tulane Association of Business Alumni that's been an annual tradition for most of the last half century.

Panels jumped from subject to subject as the lawyers, engineers and accountants in attendance earned continuing education credits in between networking opportunities and a lunch.

Earlier in the day, three coffee industry insiders talked about how the Trump Administration's tariffs are making it more difficult and expensive but businesses are adapting.

Ryan McKinnon of Westfeldt Brothers, the New Orleans-based coffee importer, said that one side effect of the import taxes is buyers are sourcing coffee beans from countries with lower tariffs — like Mexico and Honduras — and moving away from places like Brazil, which has a higher tax.

""There will be some differences in taste profile, but you can get some that are very close,"" McKinnon said.

Tulane University President Michael Fitts used a portion of his time to promote his school's vision to expand its downtown campus, centered around the hoped-for redevelopment of the former Charity Hospital building, which has moldered since Hurricane Katrina.

Fitts envisions a thriving downtown neighborhood, propelled by Tulane biomedical research and the companies it spawns, as the catalyst for a revival of New Orleans' struggling economy.

The Esmeralda 7 project, composed of seven connected solar farms proposed by NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power, and Invenergy, was designed to sit across around 185 square miles of public land, an area nearly the size of Las Vegas. The plan promised to deliver about 5,350 MW of electricity, enough to power nearly 2 million homes – that’s three times the Hoover Dam’s generating capacity.

The Biden administration had permitted the developers’ joint proposals, and the Trump administration had advanced the project’s draft environmental impact statement. However, the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hadn’t issued a final environmental impact statement or record of decision.

Yesterday, the BLM’s website marked the project as canceled. That’s part of a broader shift within the Trump administration away from utility-scale renewable energy development on federal land — even as global clean energy buildout accelerates.

According to Politico, “The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had ‘agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.'”

The BLM had spent years reviewing Esmeralda 7’s potential impacts on wildlife and public lands, so clean energy advocates say the decision to scrap the project is more political than procedural. “The Trump administration’s reported cancellation of Nevada’s largest solar and storage project will restrict America’s ability to produce homegrown clean energy,” the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said in a statement. “This action hurts America’s economy, its energy security, and the jobs of thousands of hardworking Americans.”

Electrek’s Take

Anyone shocked by this move hasn’t been paying attention, but that doesn’t make it any less destructive. Killing the Esmeralda 7 project isn’t just a setback for Nevada — it’s a blow to US energy independence, and making the developers jump through the same hoops all over again is a stall tactic. Utility-scale solar, like Esmeralda 7, is the backbone of the transition away from fossil fuels and toward true domestic energy dominance.

The US still spends billions each year importing oil, even as solar power remains the cheapest source of new electricity in history. Every canceled project like this one delays when the US can power itself with affordable clean energy, which means higher prices, higher emissions, and fewer jobs in the long run. And don’t expect this one to be a one-off cancellation of renewables on federal lands, seeing how Trump is encouraging the buildout of fossil fuel projects on those same lands.

During drinking water treatment, the presence of bromide can create carcinogenic byproducts that utilities need expensive treatment equipment to avoid.
EPA will also give more loopholes to coal plants, including giving retiring coal plants more time to operate without adequate pollution controls.
The Trump administration is now giving the green light for power plants to keep dumping toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies.","Coal-fired power plants discharge wastewater containing toxic chemicals and heavy metals directly into waterways that serve as sources of drinking water for more than 30 million Americans. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized improved wastewater treatment standards for coal-fired power plants. But now, Trump’s EPA is trying to gut these safeguards at the behest of the coal power industry. As part of a recent Trump administration announcement to bail out the failing coal industry, the EPA proposed to delay the compliance deadlines for five years and may use that time to gut the standards altogether.

Power plants have historically been by far one of the largest sources of toxic pollutants in America’s rivers, lakes, and streams. Last year the EPA updated safeguards to require coal power plants to upgrade their technology to meet zero-discharge requirements for their three largest waste streams: wastewater generated by power plant air pollution scrubbers, water used to flush out coal ash that accumulates at the bottom of the coal boiler (known as bottom ash), and leachate from coal ash surface impoundments and landfills. EPA had updated the standards, known as Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELGs, to require substantial reductions in the amount of arsenic, mercury, and other pollutants that power plants are permitted to dump into U.S. waterways.

Affordable technologies are available to completely eliminate toxic pollution from coal plants’ wastewater — there is no excuse for not requiring coal plants to begin using this technology. The standards will significantly reduce toxic metals and other harmful pollutants such as bromide that are difficult and costly to remove from our drinking water. During drinking water treatment, the presence of bromide can create carcinogenic byproducts that utilities need expensive treatment equipment to avoid. Some drinking water utilities have been forced to install expensive new treatment systems to remove toxic contaminants from upstream coal-fired power plants. Municipal drinking water utilities across the country have pressed EPA to ensure strong guidelines to control discharges of toxic chemicals from coal-fired power plants.

The benefits of requiring power plants to meet the new wastewater zero-discharge standards were estimated to be at least three to six times greater than the costs to industry, including reduced incidences of cancer and cardiovascular disease, reduced lead exposures in children, and reduced drinking water treatment costs.

Under the safeguards that EPA adopted in 2024, power plants are required to notify EPA by the end of the year if they intend to retire rather than meet the new zero-discharge requirements, and to meet the requirements by the end of 2029. EPA’s new proposed rule would postpone those deadlines for five years until the end of 2031 and the end of 2034. EPA will also give more loopholes to coal plants, including giving retiring coal plants more time to operate without adequate pollution controls.

The Trump Administration is trying to bail out the coal industry with direct subsidies and by gutting basic pollution controls, but the fact is that these plants are aging, costly, and polluting and cannot compete with clean energy, which is cheaper and more reliable. Coal now generates just 15% of American electricity because it’s the most polluting, dangerous, and expensive way to produce power. When they prop up corporate polluters, we all pay the price through higher electricity bills and toxic pollution.

Even though the Clean Water Act requires polluters to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available to treat wastewater, prior to 2015 most coal plants had no limits on toxic pollutants in their wastewater discharges. In response to an Earthjustice suit filed in 2010, EPA revised the wastewater standards for the first time in decades. Coal-fired power plants were required to install state-of-the-art wastewater treatment technology and monitor local water quality. But then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler finalized a weaker rule in 2020. Earthjustice filed a lawsuit challenging that weakening of the rules, which resulted in new standards finalized in 2023. For the first time, those standards included new treatment standards for leachate from power plant coal ash disposal sites, a result of a court victory won by Earthjustice and partner groups in 2019, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down a prior attempt by EPA to exempt these waste streams from more stringent discharge limits.

The EPA plans to hold a public hearing on October 14, you can participate. The Trump administration is now giving the green light for power plants to keep dumping toxic chemicals into drinking water supplies. But we will see them in court.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:03:35.521433

The IRA’s tax credit for clean hydrogen production, known as 45V, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel.
The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure.
California’s regional hub, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, plans to continue without the financing and could turn to state funds to make up the difference.
The state Clean Truck and Bus Vouchers program, known as HVIP, and the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Investment Plans could bolster offtakers.","In July, China launched the world’s largest green hydrogen plant. One month later, India’s government backed 19 projects designed to make the country a leader in producing green hydrogen, which could help decarbonize everything from steel to shipping. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are pumping billions of dollars into infrastructure to produce and export the fuel over the next few years.

The United States, meanwhile, is yanking funding for some of its most ambitious clean-hydrogen projects.

Last week, as part of a list of 321 grants revoked in the name of saving $7.5 billion in spending, the Department of Energy rescinded $2.2 billion in awards to two of the seven hydrogen regional hubs established under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Unlike the five other hubs, the law designed the terminated projects, in California and the Pacific Northwest, to focus exclusively on hydrogen made with renewable electricity, making them an easy target as the Trump administration slashes Biden-era clean energy projects.

Now this week a second Energy Department list shared with Canary Media indicates the agency is considering whether to pull funding from all seven hydrogen hubs, including those in Texas, Appalachia, and the mid-Atlantic and two in the Midwest.

It’s not certain whether the entire $24 billion worth of awards on the new list will be eliminated. Companies whose projects appeared only on the second list, including utilities and carbon removal firms, have yet to receive notice of cancellation. While federal officials gave companies involved in the West Coast hubs a warning before announcing the cuts last week, three separate producers involved in the other five hubs had not heard from the administration as of Thursday, according to California Hydrogen Business Council CEO Katrina Fritz, who checked in with the sources.

But already, the potential cuts are sowing doubt within the emerging sector — and in the clean energy space more broadly.

“Any amount of uncertainty in funding is really detrimental to private-sector investment, and that’s just not a good way to spur innovation domestically and compete on a global stage,” said Rachel Starr, the senior U.S. policy manager for the hydrogen program at the Clean Air Task Force. ​“Plenty of other countries are investing in this. We’re going to lose our competitive edge if we stop.”

“Yeah, I’m worried”

It remains unclear whether the document outlining a fuller list of cuts, which a lobbyist told E&E News was weeks old, represents an expansion of the previous cuts or a maximalist proposal from which the earlier terminations were whittled down.

In a statement, the Energy Department said it was ​“unable to verify” the list but that the agency ​“continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

A former Energy Department official with direct knowledge confirmed that the list is legitimate and said that it represents the grants DOE officials have recommended for cancellation to the White House. The official suggested that the agency is obfuscating its plans to pull the grants to regional hubs in red states until after a federal budget is passed, an effort to prevent congressional Republicans from adding an amendment that preserves the funding into the budget.

“They can’t do that in the middle of a government shutdown,” the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Canary Media. ​“I do expect them to cancel these funds … [but] not until there’s a full-year appropriations [bill].”

Already, key Republican lawmakers have expressed concern.

“Yeah, I’m worried,” Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito told E&E News when asked about the possibility of losing funding for West Virginia’s hydrogen hub. ​“It’s a big deal for us.”

The uncertainty only adds to the challenges facing the hydrogen industry.

The Biden administration created a two-pronged hydrogen strategy via the bipartisan infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA’s tax credit for clean hydrogen production, known as 45V, was meant to help spur supply of the fuel. The policy survived the rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July, but Republicans shortened the timeline for the write-offs from 10 years to two.

The hydrogen hubs, meanwhile, were meant to coordinate producers and offtakers to create regional ecosystems that could someday be interconnected with pipelines and other infrastructure. Even before the cuts, however, the hubs were struggling to generate enough demand.

“Low demand explains why the West Coast hydrogen ambitions have never amounted to much,” Martin Tengler, the analyst who heads the hydrogen research team at the consultancy BloombergNEF, wrote in a memo to investors Monday. ​“Low demand stems from a lack of incentives such as the quotas or carbon prices that are present in Europe, combined with a focus on sectors where hydrogen use is highly uneconomical.”

As a result, he argued, the decision to slash funding for those two hubs ​“has little direct impact on the pipeline of projects BloombergNEF has expected to come online by 2030.”

Of the six commercial green hydrogen projects larger than 1 megawatt that the consultancy tracked in its latest outlook report, four have reached a final investment decision and just one is operational. ​“All five are very small,” the investor note stated.

In an email to Canary Media, Tengler said the impact of eliminating funding for all the hubs ​“would be negative, but the most important things are the tax credits.”

Back to the States

The hubs won’t necessarily fall apart without the federal grants.

California’s regional hub, known as the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES, plans to continue without the financing and could turn to state funds to make up the difference. The Golden State’s newly overhauled cap-and-invest program is one potential source. The state Clean Truck and Bus Vouchers program, known as HVIP, and the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Program Investment Plans could bolster offtakers.

“California has been a hydrogen hub for many years, and it’s getting bigger and bigger,” Fritz said. ​“It’s already in application. There are people riding on hydrogen fuel-cell buses every day in California.”

Roxana Bekemohammadi, executive director of the U.S. Hydrogen Alliance, said it’s possible that Congress could extend the 45V tax credit before it expires at the end of 2027. But in the meantime, she said, ​“state-level hydrogen incentives are the most stable path forward.”

“The cuts to these hubs seem shortsighted and ultimately will result in the loss of jobs in our country,” said Carrie Schoeneberger, an industrial analyst who covers hydrogen for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ​“This will put the U.S. a step back and threaten U.S. leadership, which is against the stated aims of the current administration for American energy dominance.

AUSTIN, TX, UNITED STATES, October 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As American homeowners face an unprecedented surge in energy costs, with electricity prices rising 6.5% nationally and utilities requesting $29 billion in rate increases for 2025, Metal America is helping families build energy-efficient barndominiums that significantly reduce heating and cooling costs through advanced insulation systems and innovative steel construction methods.

Industry experts describe the current situation as an ""unprecedented utility affordability crisis,"" with high temperatures putting additional strain on the electric grid and driving electricity system costs higher. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports residential electricity prices increased 6.5% year-over-year as of May 2025, reaching an average of 17.47 cents per kilowatt-hour nationally—the fastest price growth since the beginning of the century.

""The dramatic rise in utility costs makes energy efficiency more critical than ever for families building their dream homes,"" said Colin Knutson, founder of Metal America. ""Our comprehensive insulation approach, combined with precision steel construction, creates homes that stay comfortable year-round while protecting homeowners from these escalating energy bills for decades to come.""

RECORD UTILITY INCREASES DRIVE DEMAND FOR EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION

The impact on households has been severe. Winter heating costs have risen 10% compared to the previous winter, according to EIA's revised February 2025 forecast. The average summer electric bill reached $719 for June-September 2024, representing an 8% year-over-year increase and the highest summer costs in a decade.

Consumer advocacy experts report that more than one-third of households have reduced or skipped paying basic expenses like medicine or food to pay energy bills in the past year. Energy assistance directors warn that families are increasingly afraid to turn on air conditioning because of bill concerns.

COMPREHENSIVE INSULATION STRATEGY ADDRESSES ENERGY CHALLENGES

Metal America's energy efficiency advantage begins with their standard double-bubble insulation included on every build, which acts as both a thermal barrier and moisture control system. The company's comprehensive approach incorporates multiple insulation strategies that often exceed local building code requirements.

The recommended insulation strategy utilizes a proven closed-cell and open-cell foam combination. The process begins with 1-2 inches of closed-cell foam applied directly to metal panels, providing R-6 to R-7 per inch while creating a complete vapor barrier that prevents condensation issues. This is followed by 3-5 inches of open-cell foam providing additional R-value at approximately R-3.5 per inch.

Traditional construction often struggles with thermal bridging and air leakage that can reduce actual energy performance by 20-30%. Metal America's systematic approach creates homes that perform closer to their designed efficiency ratings in real-world conditions.

STEEL CONSTRUCTION ADVANTAGES FOR ENERGY PERFORMANCE

Metal America's 12-gauge steel framing with 4-foot on-center spacing provides unique advantages for energy efficiency beyond structural strength. The steel framework allows for consistent insulation installation without thermal bridging issues common with traditional wood framing, while precision manufacturing ensures better air sealing than site-built construction.

The 26-gauge metal paneling, when properly insulated, creates an extremely durable thermal envelope that maintains performance characteristics for decades without settling, shifting, or degrading like traditional insulation materials.

Understanding that energy efficiency requirements vary significantly across the United States, Metal America works with local building codes and climate zones to optimize insulation strategies for each region. The company's flash-and-batt alternative system combines closed-cell foam with high-performance fiberglass batts for cost-effective code compliance while maintaining excellent moisture control.

ECONOMIC BENEFITS AMID RISING UTILITY COSTS

With utility industry experts warning that bills will continue rising, the durability of steel construction and properly installed insulation systems means energy performance remains consistent over the building's life, unlike traditional construction methods, where efficiency can degrade over time.

""We've taken the durability and cost advantages of metal construction and solved the energy efficiency equation through proper engineering and insulation design,"" said Knutson. ""The result is homes that outperform traditional construction in both comfort and efficiency, providing families with protection against these unprecedented utility cost increases.""

TURNKEY SOLUTION FOR ENERGY-CONSCIOUS BUILDERS

Metal America's complete turnkey service includes working with customers to select the optimal insulation strategy for their climate zone, budget, and performance goals. The company's 9-12 month construction timeline ensures proper installation and quality control throughout the insulation process.

The company's partnership with experienced general contractors ensures that insulation installation meets manufacturer specifications and building codes, while their comprehensive approach addresses all aspects of the thermal envelope from foundation to roof.

States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years.
The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.
Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid.
There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects.","A George Mason University report released Friday looks at how Virginia can meet its mandatory goal of decarbonizing the state’s utility providers while also getting more localities on board for certain energy projects. It comes as Virginia faces critical energy demands as ratepayers and lawmakers consider how to meet those needs and make utility bills more affordable.

The report projects that Virginia will see an 8%increase in energy demand by 2030 and a 20% increase by 2035, driven largely by the growth of data centers and manufacturing. In 2023, the commonwealth was the top energy importer from other states. Nuclear power is providing the heaviest lift of energy production in the state, with natural gas and solar increasing the most in bringing power online.

Adjunct Professor Paul Bubbosh of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason said the report is meant to be practical in light of the state’s energy needs. He said with challenges like the loss of federal incentives for renewable energy projects and supply chain holdups, the state will have to rely on natural gas in part during the interim.

“The complicating factor is that solar and wind are on a levelized cost of energy basis cheaper than natural gas and coal and nuclear power,” Bubbosh said. “However, with the added cost of supply chain issues, it further complicates the picture.”

Natural gas is also facing supply chain challenges for proposed gas plants and with fossil fuels continuing to be a scarce commodity, it will add to the steadily increasing fuel costs, Bubbosh said.

Bubbosh encourages utilities to ramp up their efficiency efforts and consider data center advancement that will allow them to pull less power off of the grid. Under the VCEA, Appalachian Power was expected to make a 2% reduction in energy consumption by 2025, while Dominion was told to reduce by 5%. Dominion has not met those goals and additional reductions will be determined by the State Corporation Commission every three years.

“Virginia has not met its targets in energy efficiency, so it needs to do a lot more in terms of getting consumers to reduce consumption during peak periods,” Bubbosh said.

States nationwide are struggling to fully understand how much power data centers will actually need in the coming years. Many projects are often thrown into the queue before financing or other permits are secured; some data centers may not actually materialize. The GMU report suggests requiring more details of a project to be locked in before the energy demand begins to be calculated.

“One of the key difficulties with a lot of these large load centers is the financing. So they now need to demonstrate that they have the financing in place and that they’re ready to go and that should improve things,” Bubbosh said.

The regional grid operator PJM has taken heat from most of the governors in the coverage area for slow walking the approval of connection permits, largely for solar and wind projects. Some of the leaders believe this is leading, in part, to higher utility bills because energy projects are waiting to be put on the grid.

PJM has pointed to supply chain issues slowing down certain projects already in the queue and delaying their actions. They have also made some reforms to ramp up their permitting process.

But Bubbosh said the real focus should be put on rural Virginia communities, to educate them on renewable energy projects, their own energy needs, and how they can meet their own demand while respecting the local culture.

“The pathway to energy security in Virginia runs through rural Virginia. It’s imperative that the Commonwealth’s government understands that to achieve lasting results, we need to bring those in Virginia, whom we’re asking so much of, such as their land, to be part of the conversation,” Bubbosh said.

There have been efforts to create a framework for statewide assistance for local regulations around energy projects. Currently, it is up to local boards of supervisors to vote if a solar, wind, gas, or nuclear project can move forward and what the related ordinances will entail. In some counties, the boards have approved a power-hungry data center project application and denied a solar farm proposal the same night.

The GMU report urges local grassroots movements to aid in creating community energy-need assessments to help rural communities understand which projects need to be built out to keep their own lights on, rather than sending power up north to Data Center Alley.

“The problem with Virginia is legislators are trying to ram through siting requirements at the state level. That will backfire, and you will get greater resistance to large scale solar deployment,” Bubbosh said. “So what we’re trying to do is to say, if you really want to achieve lasting results and energy security, you’ve got to bring on rural Virginians.”

The report suggests expanding solar projects in Northern Virginia where the power need is the greatest. Then the energy will be right at the source of the need. Once the northern parts of the state’s infrastructure has been sufficiently expanded, it would be easier to ask other communities to build out their energy infrastructure.

“Then I believe it would be appropriate for Virginia legislators to turn around and say, ‘Look, we all want to keep the lights on. We have exhausted the full potential in Northern Virginia and now we want to turn our attention to, let’s say, the Southside, or Tidewater’,” Bubbosh said.

Their goal with the report and recommendations is to aid state and local governments in moving forward with solid plans on how to meet the growing energy demands, no matter which party is dominant in the legislature or who occupies the Governor’s Mansion. That will help move the needle on siting issues, researchers hope.

“One administration is gonna come in and they’re gonna want to favor these technologies, A, B, and C. Four years later, another one’s gonna come in, and you’re gonna go back and forth,” Bubbosh said.

Bills spelling out how the state may aid communities in their energy plans are expected to be filed in the next regular legislative session, beginning in January.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_121846-1-1024x7681760120726.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=tK6hqFPG,N,,2025-10-10 16:03:29.309418

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada.
That includes final EISs for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.
The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to requests for comment.
Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.","“The administration wants to stop these projects, period, so there is no chance for approval,” he said.

Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, agreed. “As the Trump administration continues to take actions hostile to renewable energy projects, that may not be the last solar project on federal land to cancel,” he said.

The Bureau of Land Management on Thursday updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 project to note that the environmental review of the project was “cancelled.”

The decision to cancel the programmatic environmental impact statement was described by a federal government official with knowledge of the situation, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly, as a mutual decision by BLM and the handful of companies that had proposed the seven individual solar power projects that would have comprised Esmeralda 7.

The Interior Department in a statement Friday afternoon said that the solar developers and BLM had “agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”

Representatives with the energy companies involved in developing the seven individual solar power plants that collectively comprised the Esmeralda 7 project did not respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration has made its skepticism of the solar build-out in Nevada clear in recent months, with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other officials saying solar is an “intermittent” technology that doesn’t provide reliable energy. But some conservationists alarmed by the proposed rollout of large solar projects in Nevada and other Western states celebrated the demise of Esmeralda 7, saying as designed it took up up far too much land.

“Friends of Nevada Wilderness is thrilled that this poorly sited project is dead,” said Shaaron Netherton, the group’s executive director.

“In the push to get this particular project through, the BLM ignored the importance of this region’s cultural significance, biological significance and the fact that it is one of the most intact landscapes remaining in Nevada,” Netherton added.

BLM in July 2024 issued a draft programmatic environmental impact statement for the project and had originally planned to issue a final review document in April.

At least 35 commercial-scale solar power projects that were under at least preliminary review by BLM when President Donald Trump took office still await action.

That includes final EISs for the 700-megawatt capacity Copper Rays Solar Project, the 400-MW Purple Sage Solar Project and the 300-MW Bonanza Solar Project, all in Nevada.

What’s more, two major solar projects that were issued records of decision in the final weeks of the Biden administration have since sat in limbo — the Jove Solar Project in southwest Arizona and the Rough Hat Clark County Solar Project in southern Nevada, with a combined capacity to power 350,000 homes.

Burgum and his department have increasingly tightened the restrictions on solar and wind projects. Burgum signed a secretarial order that directed the agency, among other things, to eliminate policies granting “preferential treatment” for wind and solar development on federal lands and waters. The department also issued guidance to agency leaders that Burgum and Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor would need to review a long list of procedural decisions for those projects.

Burgum in August also signed an order that requires Interior to consider “capacity density” when evaluating solar and wind projects, which could hinder them because they tend to take up more land than other kinds of energy development.

The Solar Energy Industries Association did not respond to requests for comment.

But Abigail Ross Hopper, SEIA’s president and CEO, sent a letter to Burgum in August asking to meet with him to discuss his agency’s moves to restrict permit approvals for renewable energy.

Interior informally declined the meeting request, according to an industry official granted anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Concerns about project’s size

The Esmeralda 7 project was ambitious by most any measure.

It included seven individual solar projects and would have covered about 63,000 acres of BLM rangelands. If built as imagined, it could have produced about 5,350 MW of electricity — enough to power nearly 2 million homes.

Among the individual proposed projects is the 1,500-MW Gold Dust Solar Project, which would cover more than 17,000 acres and rank among the world’s largest solar projects in terms of energy output.

On the surface, at least, the project appeared to be proposed in an ideal spot in Esmeralda County.

The federal government controls 98 percent of the county’s 2.2 million acres, and BLM accounts for the vast majority of that — managing 2.1 million acres there.

There’s not a single incorporated town, and only about 729 residents, ranking it among the 20 least populated counties in the nation, with the nation’s second-lowest population density of residents per square mile.

But the project had garnered concerns about its sheer size and the potential for it to disturb migratory patterns for wildlife.

Conservation advocates, local government leaders and nearby residents have expressed concerns about the cumulative environmental impacts of the proposed Esmeralda 7 project, which in addition to covering a huge swath of desert lands would have also included miles of roads and associated transmission lines.

They have argued for placing onshore utility-scale projects on previously disturbed sites and expanding the use of rooftop solar.

The Esmeralda 7 project “would have destroyed significant archaeology sites, rare plants, bighorn sheep habitat and wilderness quality lands,” said Kevin Emmerich, a co-founder of Nevada-based Basin and Range Watch.

The cancellation of the project “will give us a chance to protect the tremendous resources of the area, including beautiful and wild mountain ranges and valleys, rare plant populations, and bighorn sheep,” said Laura Cunningham, a biologist with Western Watersheds Project.

“Paleontological fossil beds [the Esmeralda Formation] here were formative to understanding the geological history of the Great Basin,” Cunningham added. “This is good news for recreationists and for conservation efforts of an amazing landscape.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4a%2Fdb%2F0757e1e94a558b25616284763f8a%2F29730315801-859a5b0540-c-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 18:03:05.906238

A new study confirms that commonsense workplace protections from extreme heat — water, shade, breaks — help save workers from being injured on the job.

The finding — something labor and climate advocates have long known and pushed for in public policy — comes just as the federal government shutdown may have suspended the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s lengthy rulemaking process to create the U.S.’s first-ever nationwide heat standard for workers.

Some experts now fear that the agency, which ordinarily takes about seven years on average to establish new rules, will face further delays.

In order to calculate the risk of injury on hot days, researchers from the public health schools at Harvard University and George Washington University utilized OSHA’s database for workplace injuries, pulling nearly 900,000 cases from 2023.

They found that 28,000 injuries were attributable to heat, and that workers in all industry sectors, including those who mostly work indoors, were impacted. The study, published this week, also found that the risk for injury starts to increase when the heat index, a measure of how temperatures really feel to the human body, reaches 85 degrees Fahrenheit, and then becomes even more likely once the heat index passes 90.

“This study elegantly confirms what all of us have experienced,” said Charlotte Brody, vice president of health initiatives at the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups. “When it gets really hot, it’s hard to do hard work safely. And the hotter it gets, the more clumsy and fuzzy thinking we get.”

‘First big picture look’ at state heat standards

Much of the prior research on the impact of heat on workers has focused on illnesses caused by exposure to high temperatures — such at heat stroke, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. By examining the likelihood of workplace injuries on hot days, researchers are revealing other hidden costs of extreme heat — for both laborers and employers.

“It’s very clear that heat causes more than simply heat illness and unfortunately heat fatalities,” said David Michaels, one of the authors of the study and a professor at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.

“But it also causes thousands of injuries every year. When you’re working in heat, you can much more easily make mistakes.” Michaels also served as the head of OSHA from 2009 to 2017.

“The numbers on this one are a little bit eye-opening,” said Juanita Constible, a senior advocate for environmental health at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who described this study as the first national look at the impact of heat on workplace injury. (Barrak Alahmad, lead author of the study and senior research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said his team was not aware of any other nationwide study that covered the contiguous United States.)

Constible added that worker injuries hurt employers’ pocketbooks in the form of workers’ compensation claims. Recently, the insurance company Liberty Mutual found that worker injuries cost employers more than $58 billion in 2021.

Crucially, the study also found that states that have enacted their own heat standards to protect workers had a lower risk of injury on hot days compared to states that lack such rules. Constible considered this “the most critical piece of the paper.” She added, “It’s the first big picture look that we have at how well standards are working to reduce these kinds of traumatic health problems.”

The idea that working on hot days may not just be uncomfortable, but also potentially dangerous, is likely not surprising to labor and climate advocates. It’s also probably unsurprising to anyone who has had to work on hot days.

“People know it intuitively when they’re out mowing their lawn for a few hours and they get really hot and miserable, right?” said Constible. “It impairs our judgment, makes our hands slippy, affects our posture.”

With time, the human body can become acclimated to hotter temperatures. But employers often use this to justify not providing basic necessities like water, rest breaks, and shade to workers, said Brody. “This study shows that hot weather creates more workplace injuries and that a commonsense heat rule matters,” she said.

Shutdown complicates OSHA rulemaking on heat

OSHA is currently in the process of receiving final comments from parties that testified on a Biden-era proposal for a national heat rule earlier this year. But the federal government shutdown could potentially drag on or complicate this phase. “I think we can expect that this will lead to delays in promulgating an OSHA rule,” said Brody.

Constible, who testified at an OSHA hearing on the proposed heat rule in June, said that what the ultimate impact of the shutdown will be is unclear. For now, the online portal through which she and others can submit final comments to the agency remains active. Since the shutdown began last Wednesday, OSHA has not extended its deadline for comments, which is currently Oct. 30.

But could a prolonged federal funding shortage change that? The online portal is, after all, just a website, that “like all the others, requires maintenance,” said Constible. Without that, “the question is: Will it continue to work?” She noted that there is an option to email comments to the agency. “If the deadline does not get extended and the website’s not working, then we’ll just start emailing. Or I’ll walk down to OSHA’s office.”

Grist’s emailed request to OSHA for comment returned an automatic message citing the government shutdown as a reason why the account is not being monitored.

Even if the current heat standard proposal continues to move through OSHA without a shutdown-related delay, Constible and Brody expressed concern it may ultimately be watered down — due to industry groups who say following standards is expensive and burdensome and President Donald Trump’s deregulatory agenda.

Michaels, however, argued that, “if the Trump administration recognizes the importance of protecting workers, they will issue a strong standard.”

The average permitting process takes four to five years to complete, which delays an estimated total of $1.5 trillion in investment.

Permit delays impact telecommunications, transit, and dozens of other industries. For example, more than 3,000 homes and businesses in Bedford County, Virginia, were supposed to be connected to the internet via fiber cables by October 2025, but the project was postponed to June 2026, in part due to the problems with obtaining a railroad-crossing permit. An August 4, 2025, Los Angeles Times article noted that third-party permitting requirements were among the reasons for the excessive costs and delays in California’s High-Speed Rail project.

Congress and the Trump administration are working to modernize the permitting process. On July 25, 2025, House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) introduced H.R. 4776, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act, which would shorten permitting timelines and limit the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act. On September 9, 2025, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced new guidance on preconstruction permitting requirements for power generation and reshoring manufacturing projects. At the state level, the National Governors Association has urged Congress to be more proactive about permitting change, while governors are taking legislative action in their states.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘ Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.","As Colorado darts toward a future powered by “clean” energy, a battle is brewing in Pueblo, where coal closures, union jobs and lost tax revenue collide with a community demanding a solution as its power plants are a primary target for a shutdown.

Between 2025 and 2031, six more coal-fired power plants in Colorado are scheduled to be shut down or converted to another energy source, such as natural gas.

With more than 800 jobs to be affected, another three plants are on the list for future closures.

The closures are raising alarm bells, notably for the unions that count the power plant workers as members. A group has put forward an action plan called the Colorado Energy Compact, calling for a “balanced and sustainable energy policy” and a transition that is “clear, stable, and grounded in the realities of our grid, our workforce, and our economy.”

Besides unions and jobs, taxes paid to local communities are also a major worry, with revenue ranging from 12% of the total collected in Pueblo County to as high as 33.7% in Moffat County.

The compact is drawing together more than two dozen organizations and individual experts in energy, labor and public policy, according to Action Colorado’s Sara Blackhurst.

The plan is designed as both a tool and an accountability check for lawmakers and regulators, focusing on a state standard that, the compact maintains, should be technology-neutral and which supports a balanced mix of current and emerging technologies. The goal, the compact said, is to ensure a transition that benefits Colorado’s environmental and economic future, protects families, and sustains local economies.

The fight over Comanche plants

In Pueblo, residents are fighting back to keep the Comanche power plants open. They oppose wind or solar energy, which they claim is unreliable.

The Comanche station just south of Pueblo is a 695-acre site with a rail system, water contracts, transmission capacity and injection, according to a report from the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee. It includes three coal-generating units “that have provided highly-paid, family supporting jobs and tax payments of tens of millions of dollars for decades,” the report said.

Comanche 1 closed in 2022. Comanche 2 will close in 2025. Comanche 3, which opened in 2010, will close no later than Jan. 1, 2031, about 10 years ahead of schedule.

The controversy surrounding the Comanche power plants comes at a time when the Trump administration has withdrawn support for “clean” energy, cutting over $500 million in grants to Colorado companies and universities. Additionally, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a Colorado native, said he wants to “unleash American energy at home and abroad.” Wright said America should focus on ensuring a wide array of cheap, abundant and sustainable energy sources that include geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

The campaign to save the Comanche plants suggests a major battle is brewing over the two Xcel units in Pueblo.

The Colorado Fiscal Institute, in a Sept. 2024 report, said the closure of Comanche 3 alone will cost about 77 jobs and about $31 million annually in tax revenue to the Pueblo community.

The same report said the Environmental Protection Agency’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment tool estimated that closing Comanche 3 would result in avoided health costs benefiting Colorado between $52 million and $67 million annually, with Pueblo County specifically benefiting between $4.6 million and $5.6 million.

The report downplayed the benefits of nuclear energy as a replacement energy source and instead recommended wind and solar.

On the opposite side, the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, a group initiated by Xcel Energy and made up of community leaders, has looked at potential replacements for the energy sources at Comanche 3.

The PIESAC group is led by attorney Frances Koncilja and investor Corinne Koehler; members Jerry Bellah, vice president of IBEW local 8; Sara Blackhurst of Action Colorado; Russell De Salvo, who heads the Pueblo Depot Authority; Patty Erjavec, former president of Pueblo Community College; former judge Dennis Maes; Timothy Mottet, a former president of CSU-Pueblo; Duane Nava, head of the Greater Pueblo Chamber; Jeff Shaw, president of Pueblo Economic Development; and former Pueblo County Commissioner Chris Wiseman.

The group’s report, which came out in January 2024, looked at all the impacts, noting “the Pueblo community has supported these early closures and done more to reduce emissions in the state than any other community.”

The report said the economic hit from closing Comanche 3 would total $196 million to Pueblo and result in the loss of hundreds of high-wage, career-level jobs. Pueblo would lose more than $845 million in tax revenues by 2070, the report added.

Its proposed solution: “Of all the technologies we studied, only advanced nuclear generation will make Pueblo whole and also provide a path to prosperity.”

The group believes that nuclear power would support 200 to 300 permanent high-paying jobs and generate $95 million in local property taxes.

The backup plan is combined cycle natural gas plant with carbon capture for 20 to 25 long-term jobs and about $16.5 million in annual tax revenue.

Wind and solar would generate “a handful of non-union jobs” and about $2 million annually in tax revenue, PIESAC said.

‘Just transition’

In August, the Public Utilities Commission deliberated on the first phase of a $15 billion “just transition” energy resource plan submitted by Xcel, Colorado’s largest utility company and operator of the Pueblo plants, that includes the future of the Comanche operations.

The plan is tied to a settlement agreement reached in 2022 between Xcel and partners that include state agencies, environmental groups, local governments, including the city of Pueblo and Pueblo County, and large customers, such as Walmart, and labor unions.

The “just transition” plan would add more than 6,000 megawatts of new generation and storage. Over the next five years, Xcel would add 10,000 megawatts of new generation and storage capacity. Final approval of both phases of the plan, according to Xcel, is expected sometime next year.

The settlement agreement aims to keep Pueblo “whole” regarding tax revenue by compensating the county for property tax revenue due to the acceleration of the retirement date of Comanche 3.

During the meeting, PUC Chair Eric Blank called the “just transition” plan the “single largest resource acquisition in the history of Colorado and an over $15 billion commitment from customers.”

The plan’s cost raised worries among the commission about its potential for “exorbitant” hikes in utility rates to ratepayers.

The PUC said it would issue a final decision on the first phase in the coming weeks.

In a statement issued by the Colorado Energy Office after the meeting, Gov. Jared Polis said he is “enthusiastic about the plan to save people money and achieve faster pollution reductions while bringing new jobs to communities and investing in rural Colorado.”

Polis added that “the free market is driving the transition to clean energy in a way that will help people hold on to more of their hard-earned money, clean our air, achieve energy independence, and continue our state’s economic growth.”

For its part, Xcel said it is committed to supporting its workforce both in Pueblo and Hayden with “reskilling and retraining programs, and efforts to retain employees in both the short and long term.” The company also said it is committed to addressing the tax revenue issue and listening to the voices of local leaders.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘

Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.

At the end of August, Pueblo County commissioners fought back, telling the PUC through a filing that they had invested limited financial resources and time to participate in the PUC’s proceeding, “as well as the promised follow-on ‘Pueblo Just Transition Solicitation’ to ensure that the residents of Pueblo County would receive a meaningful ‘Just Transition’ from a coal community to a high tech clean energy hub.”

The county also spent $2 million on the PIESAC study to develop clean energy generation options for Pueblo, and if implemented, those options, they said, would render Pueblo “whole.”

The commissioners claimed other partners in a settlement agreement, including the Colorado Energy Office, ignored Pueblo’s “bargained-for solutions.” They accused the Colorado Energy Office, the Office of Just Transitions and the Utility Consumer Advocate, which is part of PUC, of failing to act in good faith, including failing to consider the option of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement energy source.

The commissioners asked that Comanche 2 and Comanche 3 continue to operate, saying they would approach the Trump administration and Wright, the energy secretary, “until replacement generation is constructed in Pueblo.”

“The (PUC) has made it clear that it is a futile exercise to participate in these proceedings,” the county commissioners wrote.

The local electrical worker union in Pueblo also weighed in through a letter submitted to U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Grand Junction, whose district includes Pueblo.

In a Sept. 10 letter, Jerry Bellah, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, told Hurd his group supports green energy “but that the green jobs being offered to Pueblo do not come close to replacing the jobs that are currently at Comanche.”

Bellah said the handful of solar farm jobs are low-paying positions.

“For too long, the hardworking men and women of the IBEW have been ignored with false promises of middle-class, family-supporting jobs in exchange for our support in closing coal plants,” Bellah wrote. “We are smart enough, however, to know when we are getting the shaft, which is what is being done to the Pueblo community and the workers at Comanche. We all deserve better than this.”

Bellah noted Hurd had reached out to Trump to keep Comanche open and said his group would “support any elected leader, regardless of party, who supports jobs, and we will oppose any elected leader who votes to end our jobs.”

Pueblo County voters have now twice voted for Trump over his Democratic opponents.

Blackhurst of Action Colorado added that the union jobs issue is the primary reason for the energy compact.

“Pueblo is being robbed,” she told Colorado Politics. “They (state government) have made labor workers acceptable collateral,” as well as the communities in which they live and work.

The Colorado Energy Compact

Led by Action Colorado, the compact’s authors intend for it to provide a roadmap for building an energy future that is “ambitious, achievable, and rooted in Colorado’s best interests.”

It focuses on five areas — affordability and economic competitiveness; labor, community and “just transition;” energy system reliability and feasibility; legal and regulatory integrity; and transparency and accountability.

The first focus area, on affordability, would look at the cost to consumers, protecting the tax revenue base and long-term economic resilience.

The second focus — on labor and community — said any legislation or regulation should ensure comparable wages and benefits, as well as “enforceable” retraining, union participation and local hiring. It also calls for policies that allow workers to stay in their current communities.

A survey conducted by Colorado Mountain College and the state Office of Just Transition, and as reported by the Steamboat Pilot in March, said 61% of workers at the Craig Xcel plant and the Colowyo and Trapper mines want to stay in their local communities if they transition to new jobs.

The third focus — on energy system reliability — calls for a “realistic” phasing of timelines tied to permitting, workforce readiness and infrastructure — “not political deadlines.” It also recognizes the role of natural gas and emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear power, which was added to the state’s list of “clean” energy technologies by the legislature in the 2025 session.

In the focus on legal and regulatory integrity, the compact said terms like “clean energy” and “eligible technologies” must be defined in law, not by regulators.

Additionally, transparency and accountability must include an open stakeholder process, with full notice and “without surprises” and models made public and independently validated, the compact said. It should also include a regular public review.

“Without accountability,” the compact said, “even well-intentioned rules look like closed-door deals and public trust collapses.”

Blackhurst told Colorado Politics that the groups behind the compact are sharing it with lawmakers, hoping it would provide a tool for reviewing legislation in the future.

That’s critical, Blackhurst said, as the PUC is going through a sunset review in the 2026 session.

A fact sheet provided to the Town of Gilchrist earlier this year stated that the compact, unlike the governor’s “top-down” Clean Energy Planning process, is more inclusive and offers a framework rooted in local control.

It is not a lobbying effort, the fact sheet insisted. But “without stakeholder-driven guardrails, the direction will be set by others — without you in the room,” it said.

Gilchrist town councilmembers unanimously approved joining the compact in August, along with providing some financial support.

Office of Just Transition

Approved by legislation in 2019, the Office of Just Transition focuses on economic development for communities affected by the closure of coal mines.

For the past several years, the office, with 3.5 full-time employees, has spent about $15 million annually on community development, worker education, and training for those areas.

What’s missing, many said, is wage parity — what workers earn when they transition from high-paying jobs to whatever comes next.

The BlueGreen Alliance, in a 2023 report, pointed to the wage parity issue.

When coal mines close, workers are vulnerable to job loss, and many will struggle to find comparable employment that aligns with their existing skills, experience, and compensation levels, according to the report.

The office has made progress in economic development by supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship, the report added. But the opportunities to find local “high-road” jobs for former coal workers have been missed.

“The quality of the job — such as the benefits offered like health insurance, a retirement plan, and workers’ compensation benefits, or wage parity to previous employment — is not being considered in program development or implementation” for OJT, the alliance said.

‘Extreme claims‘

In a response to Pueblo commissioners on Sept. 12, several environmental groups said any decision by PUC to change votes would lead to further controversy and litigation over procedural improprieties.

That’s a reference to comments by Blank, the PUC chairman, in a Sept. 4 hearing that he is considering taking “another look at some of the labor issues raised in the county’s response,” as well as revisiting a prior vote tied to Xcel’s plans for “credits for resource located in communities with retiring coal plants,” a main concern raised by Pueblo County.

The credits are part of a Near Term Procurement request by Xcel — a solicitation for the development of energy generation that would draw federal and state tax credits.

The coalition of environmental groups includes GreenLatinos, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado.

“Moreover, promising to revisit votes in response to baseless accusations of political bias and extreme claims (including a threat to invite federal interference) sets problematic precedent and may incentivize parties to make similarly baseless and extreme claims in the future to get the Commission’s attention when they are displeased with the Commissioner’s oral deliberations and decisions,” the coalition said.

The coalition, in particular, took issue with Blank’s statements and the Sept. 4 hearing, which the group said hinted at “unfairness,” since the PUC had already deliberated on the Xcel plan in August and failed to provide opportunities to other parties to address the issues raised by Pueblo County.

By revisiting votes on the Xcel plan, the PUC would reward Pueblo County for “flouting the Commission’s well-established hearing and deliberations process” without allowing other parties the same opportunity, the coalition said.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/default-social-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 19:02:45.328168

“This bill will ensure that California adopts best-in-class regulations for carbon dioxide pipeline safety through a public process that elevates community input while encouraging major investment in the clean energy transition of our most fossil fuel intensive industries,” said Senator Stern. “I am grateful to Governor Newsom for charting this new path.”

In 2022, Governor signed SB 905 (Caballero) as part of the Climate Commitment to encourage the development of these projects in California with the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework. SB 614 builds off this effort and supports these projects with the authorization to develop safe carbon dioxide pipelines from where the carbon is captured and removed to where it will be permanently stored. In addition, SB 840 (Limon) allocates $85 million in the 2026-27 budget year from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to advance climate-focused technological innovation, related research, and the deployment of climate solutions, such as carbon capture and removal projects. The GGRF is supported by revenue generated from the state’s world-leading Cap-and-Trade, now Cap-and-Invest program, which places a price on climate pollution. These efforts are examples of policy momentum aimed at fostering the decarbonized economy of tomorrow.

“Carbon capture is an important part of the climate puzzle – we need CCUS technologies to deliver on our climate goals and build California’s clean energy future,” said bill co-author Assemblymember Petrie-Norris. “I’m grateful for the Governor’s partnership to ensure the safe deployment of carbon pipelines in California. SB 614 will accelerate California’s climate progress, spur billions of dollars in climate investments, and create thousands of high road jobs across the state.”

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

The state also continues to set clean energy records. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available – the largest economy in the world to achieve this level of clean energy.

Esmeralda 7 was supposed to produce a gargantuan 6.2 gigawatts of power – equal to nearly all the power supplied to southern Nevada by the state’s primary public utility. It would do so with a sprawling web of solar panels and batteries across the western Nevada desert. Backed by NextEra Energy, Invenergy, ConnectGen and other renewables developers, the project was moving forward at a relatively smooth pace under the Biden administration, albeit with significant concerns raised by environmentalists about its impacts on wildlife and fauna. And Esmeralda 7 even received a rare procedural win in the early days of the Trump administration when the Bureau of Land Management released the draft environmental impact statement for the project.

When Esmeralda 7’s environmental review was released, BLM said the record of decision would arrive in July. But that never happened. Instead, Donald Trump issued an executive order as part of a deal with conservative hardliners in Congress to pass his tax megabill, which also effectively repealed the Inflation Reduction Act’s renewable electricity tax credits. This led to subsequent actions by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to freeze all federal permitting decisions for solar energy.

Flash forward to today, when BLM quietly updated its website for Esmeralda 7 permitting to explicitly say the project’s status is “cancelled.” Normally when the agency says this, it means developers pulled the plug.

Carmaker walks back program that would have allowed dealers to offer $7,500 US tax credit

Ford Motor is walking back a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 US tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired Sept. 30, the company said on Thursday.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson said.

The decision follows a similar move from General Motors on Wednesday. While automakers including Hyundai and Stellantis have offered cash off incentives to bridge the gap for buyers, Ford and GM took a different approach.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 SU credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives, a spokesperson said.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. It is unclear why Ford canceled its program.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: A Rhode Island labor union earlier this week filed a lawsuit to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency’s effort to cancel $7 billion in funding for the Solar for All program. The initiative established by the Biden Inflation Reduction Act helped low-income communities install solar energy, while creating jobs in the field.

Amy Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island said, “Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy.”

“EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program,” Romero said.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PULLS THE PLUG ON NEVADA SOLAR PROJECT: The Bureau of Land Management canceled Nevada’s massive solar project yesterday evening.

The department updated its planning website for the Esmeralda 7 solar project, stating that the environmental review has been “canceled.” The agency did not provide a reason for the cancellation. The project cancellation was first reported by Heatmap.

The Esmeralda 7 project would have built seven solar power plants with battery energy storage on nearly 118,000 acres of federal land near Tonopah, Nevada. The project would have produced nearly 6.2 gigawatts of power.

The cancellation of the project is part of a series of moves by the Trump administration to stymie clean energy projects. BLM’s move furthers the administration’s efforts to hinder renewable energy sources like offshore wind projects.

TRUMP RESPONDS TO CHINA ON RARE EARTHS: President Donald Trump responded this morning to China’s move to curb rare earth element exports by threatening a “massive” increase in tariffs.

“There is no way that China should be allowed to hold the World ‘captive,’ but that seems to have been their plan for quite some time, starting with the ‘Magnets’ and, other Elements that they have quietly amassed into somewhat of a Monopoly position, a rather sinister and hostile move, to say the least,” the president wrote in a post to Truth Social.

He also threatened unspecified other “countermeasures,” and suggested that he would be canceling the planned meeting with Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Korea later this month.

KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE REVIVAL: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said today that a proposal to revive the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta to the U.S. could help economies of both countries.

“We are looking for areas where the integration of our economies will be better for us both. We have opportunities in the energy sector – there are many possible projects, including Keystone XL, but there are others,” Carney said at a press conference, Reuters reports.

Carney floated the idea during a meeting with Trump earlier this week to discuss easing tariffs. The approvals for the pipeline permits have fluctuated depending on the administration in power.

Former President Barack Obama denied the pipeline’s permit. It was later revived during Trump’s first term, and then it was revoked by former President Joe Biden.

CURTIS TO LEAD COP30 DELEGATION: Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah will lead a bipartisan delegation to the COP30 global climate conference next month in Brazil, alongside Sen. Chris Coons.

Curtis told E&E News that at least three other Republicans expressed interest in the trip.

There won’t be an executive branch delegation, as the relevant State Department offices have been limited by the shutdown.

“We have an agenda that is really coming together nicely. We’re super happy with it,” Curtis told the outlet.

For years now, Curtis has been one of the Republicans most engaged on the issue of climate change. As a member of the House, he formed a GOP group dedicated to climate change.

OIL DROPS BELOW $60 AS RISKS DECLINE: Oil prices hit the lowest levels in months as traders digested the implementation of the peace deal between Israel and Hamas.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell below the $60 a barrel mark this morning, a drop of nearly 4%. Brent crude dipped below $63.

“Finally having some kind of peace process in the Middle East is lowering the shoulders a little bit,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, told Reuters. He said that the deal could ease fears about oil tankers passing through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea.

‘DRILL, BABY, DRILL’ UPDATE: The U.S. oil and gas rig count fell this week by two to 547, Baker Hughes said today.

The rig count is now down 7% on the year.

The lower prices this week will likely not help with the pessimism in the industry.

STORM TO HIT THE EAST COAST THIS WEEKEND: A nor’easter storm is set to hit the East Coast this weekend, bringing flooding, heavy winds, and beach erosion.

The storm is forecast to develop off the Florida coast and then move northward this weekend into next week. There is potential for major flooding in places like North Carolina, New Jersey, and Cape Cod.

What is a nor’easter? It is a storm that occurs along the East Coast, bringing coastal winds inland. The wind direction is what defines a nor’easter. The storm carries winds from the northeast at around 58 mph or more. It could cause beach erosion and coastal flooding.

“This will be a damaging storm for some along the Atlantic coast,” AccuWeather Chief On-Air Meteorologist Bernie Rayno said.

TEN LARGE NUCLEAR REACTORS UNDERWAY IN NEXT FIVE YEARS? BECHTEL SAYS YES: Bechtel CEO Craig Albert said that it is possible to have 10 new large nuclear plants under construction in the next five years, if the risks of projects are shared properly among stakeholders. That aligns with the goal laid out in Trump’s nuclear power executive order.

“Everyone at the table realizes they’re going to have to take on more risk than they have in the past,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg.

Bechtel has built 80% of the U.S. nuclear fleet, including the most recently built one, the Vogtle plant in Georgia. That project was subject to huge cost overruns.

Albert said that the company would be willing to take on more risks for future projects. In the past, it has been paid based on its time and effort.

U.S. WEIGHS FUNDING FOR GREENLAND’S POLAR BEARS: State Department officials are working on proposals to spend $50 million protecting polar bears in Greenland and $25 million for snow leopards in Nepal, the Washington Post reports.

That would equate to around $100,000 per polar bear.

The funding is especially noteworthy because the Trump administration has tried to slash funding not aligned with its America First agenda.

The publication notes that some observers have flagged that the two countries in question are particularly sensitive with respect to the Trump administration’s aims. Trump, of course, has repeatedly discussed taking control of Greenland. And Nepal is of geopolitical importance because of its location between China and India.

Trump’s nomination of Douglas Troutman to be the Environmental Protection Agency’s assistant administrator for toxic substances fell along partisan lines at a confirmation hearing Oct. 8: Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee praised his experience, while Democrats voiced concerns about his industry ties. Both sides asked him about efforts to speed up chemical reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), but from different perspectives.

Ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called Troutman an “industry operative” who “has spent his entire career as a lobbyist for oil, gas, and chemical interests . . . aping the fossil fuel disinformation campaign to undermine science and obstruct efforts aimed at protecting people from pollution.”

Whitehouse said in his opening remarks that he has “zero confidence that Mr. Troutman cares either about chemical safety or pollution prevention.”

But Republicans, including EPW chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said Troutman’s tenure at the American Cleaning Institute—a cleaning products industry association, where he led legal and government affairs for more than a decade—has prepared him well for the role.

Troutman couldn’t respond directly to Whitehouse’s opening remarks but said in his testimony that, if confirmed, he is committed to working to “provide a clean, safe environment, with an eye toward strong economic growth.”

Questions on PFAS, new chemical reviews

Capito kicked off questioning by asking Troutman about the speed and efficiency of chemical safety reviews under TSCA, which Troutman would oversee. “American innovators need certainty,” she told Troutman, before asking, “What specific reforms would you pursue to achieve both faster reviews and predictable, commercially viable outcomes?”

Troutman did not cite any specific reforms, but he said he would follow statutory requirements while welcoming new staff and information technology resources that will help deliver his promise to press for more “timely” and “certain” reviews of chemicals.

The EPA has taken a number of steps this year to streamline its process for reviewing new chemicals. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a program last month to begin “expeditious reviews” of chemicals relevant to the buildout of data center infrastructure for the artificial intelligence sector.

Troutman said that his intent is for “nothing to change with regard to [EPA’s] robust reviews of new and existing chemicals based on the risk-based process under TSCA.” But Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) pushed back. “Zeldin said that the Trump EPA is going to ‘get out of the way,’ so that these [data centers] can be built without protections against toxic chemicals,” he told Troutman. “I'm not hearing you say that you’re going to stand up to him.”

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) pressed Troutman on the health risks of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), microplastics, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals highlighted in the White House’s recent Make America Healthy Again report and stressed the need for clear action to minimize harm that can come from the use of plastics. Troutman acknowledged the concerns and alluded to ongoing EPA programs and interagency strategies but offered few specifics.

“I’m expecting a strategy of doing nothing,” Merkley said. “I’d love for you to surprise us.”

Pesticides use was also discussed at length. “Crop protection tools such as glyphosate and dicamba are critical to modern agricultural practices,” Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-NB) said. He urged Troutman to propose some kind of reform to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the nation’s primary federal pesticide law. FIFRA regulates pesticides in a way that “doesn’t reflect what’s really happening on farmers’ fields,” Ricketts said. Troutman said that, if confirmed, he’s committed to following FIFRA’s risk-based statutory requirements.

Several lawmakers, including Merkley and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), grilled Troutman on the EPA’s recently proposed changes to implementing TSCA that would, among other things, limit the agency’s consideration of fence-line or “overburdened” communities when assessing the risks of chemicals.

“We see in study after study that cancer rates are higher around certain facilities,” Merkley said. But, “when asked if you believe certain communities have higher risk to harmful chemicals, you chose not to answer with a simple yes or no,” Padilla told Troutman. Instead, Troutman made “a big circular, bureaucratic journey around the question,” Merkley said.

The committee will accept written questions from senators, along with the nominee’s responses, by Oct. 17 and 27, respectively, and will then deliberate and vote on whether to advance Troutman's nomination to the full Senate.

New factory in Austin to anchor U.S. energy resilience and grid modernisation efforts.

Participation in Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource program enables homeowners to feed power directly into the grid.

Austin startup aims to decentralize the grid

Base Power, a fast-growing energy technology company based in Austin, has raised $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the rollout of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by venture firm Addition, with participation from Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, and Elad Gil, as well as new investors including Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding positions Base Power among the most well-capitalized startups in the U.S. energy transition, reflecting investor confidence in distributed energy solutions as the grid faces mounting strain from extreme weather, ageing infrastructure, and rising electrification demand.

CEO and co-founder Zach Dell said the company is driven by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent how power is generated, stored, and shared. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” he said.

Distributed storage meets domestic manufacturing

Base Power’s business model revolves around leasing batteries directly to homeowners, offering reliable backup power while allowing participants to sell excess energy back to the grid. This decentralised system strengthens grid resilience and helps integrate renewable energy, addressing one of the core challenges of the U.S. clean energy transition: balancing supply and demand in real time.

As part of its expansion strategy, Base Power is developing its first energy storage and power electronics manufacturing facility at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin. The company plans to establish additional facilities to meet surging demand for distributed battery systems.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware,” said co-founder and COO Andrew Lopas. “We need to make that hardware here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning our second.”

By investing in domestic production, Base Power is aligning with national efforts to reindustrialize the energy sector, reduce dependence on imported components, and strengthen supply chain resilience — a priority under the Biden administration’s clean energy and manufacturing policies.

Powering the grid from the ground up

Base Power recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to aggregate thousands of home batteries and sell electricity directly into the state’s power market. The initiative could prove pivotal for grid operators struggling with growing demand volatility and the integration of intermittent renewables.

The company’s distributed model also complements recent federal initiatives encouraging grid-edge technologies, such as the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. With utilities and regulators seeking cost-effective ways to improve reliability, distributed batteries — collectively acting as “virtual power plants” — are emerging as a scalable alternative to large, centralized infrastructure.

For investors, the model offers exposure to one of the fastest-growing segments of the energy transition: behind-the-meter storage. BloombergNEF projects U.S. residential battery capacity could increase fivefold by 2030, driven by falling costs, rising solar adoption, and regional incentive programs.

Rebuilding American energy capacity

Beyond its immediate commercial ambitions, Base Power’s approach speaks to a broader transformation in the U.S. energy economy — one that blends software, manufacturing, and local ownership to rebuild resilience from the household level up.

The company’s long-term vision extends beyond residential markets. Executives have indicated interest in expanding to small businesses, microgrids, and community-scale deployments, leveraging the same distributed platform to support energy equity and grid flexibility.

As Lopas put it, “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrialising America and reinventing the grid.”

If successful, Base Power’s model could help redefine how power is produced and consumed in the world’s largest economy — turning homes into active participants in the clean energy transition while strengthening the backbone of U.S. grid infrastructure.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Base-Power-Secures-1B-to-scale-U.S.-Home-Battery-Network.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 20:02:45.603667

The state’s efforts to install infrastructure for electric vehicles have fallen short of its goals.

That’s according to a recent audit report from State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. It's a follow-up for an initial audit in 2022.

It determined that NYPA had not placed chargers in optimal locations and failed to review and analyze usage data for better charger placement.

It also found that the New York Power Authority’s installation of high speed EV chargers was as much as two years behind schedule.

For example, of the 200 chargers that were scheduled to be installed by the end of 2019, only 29 had actually been placed by March of 2021.

Amazon prioritized bio-based materials for the facility’s construction, with wood studs instead of metal ones at interior partitions, wood fiber insulation instead of fiberglass, and an ultra-light, lower-carbon alternative to standard drywall.

The retailer also used lower-carbon, bio-based finishes for the acoustic ceilings and flooring and salvaged wood for 43 desks used by the site operations team.

Heat pumps reduce carbon emissions and don’t require burning fossil fuels on-site, while “air curtains,” which prevent outdoor air from entering the building, are intended to reduce air-conditioning usage and boost employee comfort.

In addition, Amazon says the clerestory windows in the warehouse and the glazed glass in the office block bring in enough daylight to allow for less electrical lighting and the interior LED lighting is designed to reduce power usage.

Other sustainable features include a water reclamation system and more than 170 electric-vehicle charging stalls located outside. In total, Amazon says the facility features more than 40 technologies designed to reduce resource usage and shrink its carbon footprint.

""We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,"" said Daniel Mallory, VP of global realty, Amazon, in a corporate blog post. ""DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them.

(NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) has made a strategic investment in Talon PV LLC (“Talon”), acquiring a minority equity stake in the developer of a solar cell fab.

T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Talon is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell plant in Baytown, Texas. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S.

The T1 and Talon projects are examples of American companies investing in American energy, supported by President Trump’s OBBBA and 45x tax credits. The Texas projects are expected to reshore jobs and deliver power to meet rising electrical demand driven by AI, industrialization and residential load growth.

Both projects are expected to meaningfully add domestic manufacturing capacity and produce TOPCon solar cells, the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S. TOPCon cells utilize the quantum tunneling technology awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics earlier this week.

Under terms of the deal, T1 has entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire an equity stake in Talon. T1 and Talon remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

T1 Energy owns the 5 GW G1_Dallas solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas, and this summer signed a long-term deal with Corning Inc to obtain polysilicon and solar wafers manufactured in Michigan.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of U.S. solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Talon.

Talon PV LLC is a privately held U.S. company developing an advanced 4.8 GW TOPCon solar cell manufacturing fab with anticipated commercial availability starting in Q1 2027. The company is majority owned by Eagle Group, a diversified industrial firm with a long-standing commitment to investing in and advancing American energy production.

(WSAV) — State leaders are looking for new ways to keep electric vehicle (EV) interest charged up — after federal tax credits for EV buyers expired at the end of September.

The Clean Vehicle Tax Credit, created under the ‘Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,’ had offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. But a bill signed in July shortened its end date from 2032 to September 30, 2025, effectively ending the incentive early.

‘Range Anxiety’ No Longer a Major Issue

EV owners say Georgia’s expanding charging infrastructure is helping ease common concerns about long-distance travel.

“The charging network in Georgia is really being built out in a very robust and easy way,” said James Marlow, President of Southface and an EV owner. “When I drive to the Georgia coast, it’s no problem to stop, charge, and grab food or coffee. Charging is becoming much less of an issue.”

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Georgia now has over 90,000 registered EVs and about 2,200 charging stationsstatewide.

Local Incentives May Be the Next Step

With federal credits now gone, experts say car manufacturers and local governments may need to step in with new incentives to keep buyers interested.

“The withdrawal of incentives has definitely changed the market,” Marlow said. “But if you zoom out, electric vehicles now make up about 10% of the U.S. new car market — and that’s growing.”

He also pointed to falling battery costs, which are expected to make EVs more affordable in the coming years.

Cheaper to Operate, Easier to Charge

“I have a Tesla 3, and a full charge to 80% costs me about $12,” Marlow said. “That’s compared to nearly $60 for a full tank of gas in my Jeep — so it’s cheaper to operate.”

The Georgia Department of Transportation is currently reviewing roadways to identify potential “charging deserts” and plans to expand access across rural and suburban areas.

The ‘Battery Belt of the South’

Governor Brian Kemp has called Georgia the ‘Battery Belt of the South’— as major EV manufacturers like SK Battery, Rivian, Kia, and Hyundai continue to expand operations in the state.

Hydrogen may not grab headlines like electric cars, but it may yet power a good share of the future.","This week we received a release from Nebraska Public Power District marking the 11th annual National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Observation, which takes place each Oct. 8 in a nod to hydrogen’s atomic weight of 1.008. The release was straightforward and refreshingly free of political rhetoric. Hydrogen, it noted, is already at work providing fuel, feedstock and power to sectors across the United States, with promising applications in everything from transportation to national defense.

Roman Estrada, NPPD’s Generation Research Senior Program Manager, described hydrogen as a “technological solution available today that is flexible, domestically sourced and capable of being deployed across multiple sectors critical to our economy and national defense.” In an era when our energy debates often resemble shouting matches between wind farms and tailpipes, that’s a quietly radical statement.

Hydrogen is not a distant, pie-in-the-sky idea. It’s abundant, energy-dense, and can be produced domestically, creating the kind of economic resilience policymakers say they want but rarely seem to act on. Properly deployed, it can stabilize the grid, reduce emissions, and support industries that can’t be electrified easily — such as freight transportation, heavy manufacturing and aviation. It also has the potential to work alongside, rather than against, other energy sources.

Of course, hydrogen technology isn’t a magic wand. Storage, distribution, and infrastructure challenges remain real and expensive–but so were the early hurdles for natural gas, nuclear power, and yes, electric cars. The difference is that hydrogen never received the kind of marketing blitz or regulatory favoritism that battery electric vehicles did. Billions in subsidies and incentives have been shoveled toward lithium batteries, often with modest gains in performance, persistent supply chain vulnerabilities and as discussed in yesterday’s Gazette, a substantial fire hazard.

The federal government has invested tens of billions of dollars in subsidizing electric vehicles through a combination of tax credits, grants, and infrastructure spending. Much of that commitment stems from provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which expanded and extended tax incentives for EV purchases. Estimates suggest that the cost of these incentives to the government over the coming decade could reach well into the tens of billions of dollars, with each new EV purchase effectively costing taxpayers between $23,000 and $32,000, even though the consumer may receive only a $7,500 credit.

Meanwhile, hydrogen remained the quiet workhorse of laboratories and niche industries — less flashy, more practical, and perhaps, more promising.

We cannot, of course, discuss fuel cell technology without the name Stanley Meyer popping up. Readers may recall Meyer as the man who, in the 1980s, claimed to run a car on water.

Meyer’s work has lived on more in legend than in mainstream engineering journals, but it’s a reminder that the allure of hydrogen isn’t new. The difference now is that the science has matured and technology is catching up.

If NPPD makes it a point to formally recognize the potential, it’s worth asking a simple question: what if we’d spent a fraction of the effort pushing hydrogen that we spent subsidizing a single drivetrain technology? We might be a lot closer to energy independence — and a lot less dependent on what’s happening in someone else’s rare earth mine.

The annual report is mandated in statute by the legislature.

“With the expansion of regional hubs, a growing portfolio of grant-funded projects, and hands-on commercialization support, NCInnovation is delivering on its mission to accelerate the commercialization of UNC system applied research,” NCI President and CEO Bennet Waters said in a press release.

“The university-to-industry pipeline has long underpinned American innovation, and North Carolina remains well positioned to create regional economic development from its world-class research successes,” said Waters.

NCInnovation (NCI) is the nonprofit university research accelerator that was given a $500 million endowment by the General Assembly in the state’s 2022-23 budget. Under that endowment, NCI was allowed to use $50 million as investment income in the 2023-24 fiscal year and $90 million in the 2024-25 fiscal year.

Of the $500 million, $140 million was authorized for direct spending, but NCI instead invested the principal amount, accumulating around $20 million in interest that was put toward the group’s first set of grants. NCI also raised $25 million in outside funding from companies and businesses, which was used for items like salaries and operating expenses.

The NCI 2025 Annual Report includes $18.8 million in research funding awarded to 14 UNC System schools for 25 active projects since NCI launched.

“Our role is to ensure that university researchers in North Carolina are not just commercializing breakthrough ideas, but that those ideas have the resources, partnerships, and strategic support needed to get to the next stage here where they are started,” said NCI’s Executive Vice President and CIO Michelle Bolas. “This Annual Report shows our commitment to incorporating those best practices for the ultimate success of our innovators and other partners.”

Also noted was the expansion of NCI’s Regional Innovation Network from four hubs to seven, the launch of the entrepreneur-in-residence program, and more than 250 partnerships statewide across various industries with a focus on biohealth, agtech, defense, advanced manufacturing and energy transition.

NCI’s 2025 annual report is 72 pages long and includes detailed descriptions of the projects approved for grant funding.

Pilot grants totaled more than $2.3 million for eight grants across seven schools, and statewide RFP grants totaled nearly $7.6 million, according to the report.

Total expenses were stated at just under $12.3 million, including grants, more than $1.5 million in salaries and benefits, and regional hub expenses just below $850,000.

The pilot grants in the report include:

• $974,000 for East Carolina (biohealth) melanoma treatment

• $1,082,696 for UNC Wilmington (biohealth) multiyear vaccine development

• $999,963 for Western Carolina (biohealth) mosquito-borne infectious disease identification and risk assessment

• $641,951 for Appalachian State (AgTech) beehive improvement and monitoring system

• $369,024 for North Carolina A&T (biohealth) neuro drug delivery system

• $404,999 for UNC Greensboro (energy transition and electrification) lithium purification

• $400,971 for NC Central (biohealth) drinking water purification

• $354,607 for NC Central (energy transition and electrification) power-grid efficiency

There were 17 statewide RFP grants approved in mid-May totaling $13.6 million across 12 UNC System schools. The projects are described as having “achieved proof of concept” and showing commercial promise.

The largest of the 17 grants, more than $1.1 million, went to UNC Pembroke in the area of biohealth. The project is titled “Alzheimer’s/Traumatic Brain Injury therapeutic.”

The only other project receiving more than $1 million was for a hemp-based biopesticide for commercial poultry houses being worked on at Fayetteville State University.",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NCInnovation-logo.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 00:58:45.904629

The specter of additional, deeper federal funding cuts is haunting the clean-energy sector. A Department of Energy list shared this week with Canary Media suggests the agency is thinking about canceling a whopping $23 billion worth of energy projects.

Well, maybe.

Here’s what we know for sure: Last week, the DOE terminated $7.56 billion in federal funding for grid upgrades and energy projects, which were largely set to benefit Democratic-voting states. Right after, Energy Secretary Chris Wright called the announcement a ​“partial list” and promised that more cuts were coming — in both blue states and red ones.

From there, it gets fuzzier.

On Tuesday, sources shared a leaked spreadsheet with Canary Media that looks a lot like a follow-up to last week’s hit list. It lists the word ​“terminate” next to not only the 321 grant cancellations from last week, but hundreds of other projects too.

But despite headlines declaring this a new wave of grant cancellations, the exact nature of the list remains murky. A former DOE official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Canary Media’s Jeff St. John that the list is legitimate and that it represents the grants DOE officials have recommended for cancellation to the White House.

DOE, meanwhile, hasn’t confirmed the list’s authenticity and denies that it has yet decided to cancel any of the projects that appear only on the second list. In a statement, the DOE said it is still conducting an ​“individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” and that ​“no determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.”

Recipients who appeared only on the second list also say they haven’t heard that their grants will be canceled.

Vikrum Aiyer, global policy head at carbon-capture startup Heirloom, whose major hydrogen-hub project was included on the second list, told Canary Media’s Maria Gallucci that the company wasn’t ​“aware of a decision from DOE” to cancel its federal award.

Alliant Energy, a utility holding company whose Wisconsin Power and Light subsidiary was listed on the new spreadsheet, said in a statement that it has not been made aware of changes to its DOE grants.

And aside from the two blue-state hydrogen hubs whose funding was cut last week, several of the firms working on the other five hubs have yet to receive cancellation notices, Alexander C. Kaufman reports.

At best, the latest leaked list is just another layer of chaos and uncertainty for federal funding recipients, who are stuck trying to get answers about the status of their projects from a department that has been depleted by layoffs. At worst, though, it’s a harbinger of billions more in cuts to come for innovative American energy projects.

State and federal hurdles pile up for community solar

Community solar is in trouble, and it’s not just because of federal shakeups, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. These shared arrays help make solar power accessible to those who can’t put panels on their own roofs, whether that’s because they rent, can’t afford them, or face other barriers. That power can in turn help households reduce their bills.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July set an early sunset for tax credits that can cover as much as half of a community solar array’s cost. And states are also contributing to the decline. Developers in New York, a major community solar market, are facing higher costs for land and permitting, while in Maine, developers have to reckon with changes to its solar net-metering program, as well as lowered compensation and new fees for community solar projects.

Those state challenges, combined with the looming threat of more federal funding cuts, have all led Wood Mackenzie to reduce its forecast of new community solar installations by 8% through 2030.

Global clean energy keeps growing

Two new reports contain some good news for clean energy around the globe. For starters, solar and wind installations outpaced global power demand growth in the first half of this year, according to an analysis out this week from think tank Ember.

The number was inflated by the rush to claim EV tax credits before they expired

Americans bought over 438,000 electric vehicles (EVs) in the third quarter of 2025 – a record number. EVs accounted for 10.5% of all new cars sold, according to Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive.

The figure, however, was inflated by a rush to claim the federal government’s $7,500 EV tax credit before it expired at the end of September.

Fourth-quarter numbers will likely be much lower, as many who would otherwise have bought in Q4 rushed to shop in Q3 while they could still claim the discount.

Some automakers have extended their own $7,500 discounts to keep the vehicles as affordable as possible for the rest of this year.

But scratch the surface and you’ll see that most “options” are just variations of the same puzzle. Insurers continue to toggle the same three levers — premiums, deductibles, and networks — and present them as innovation.

The result? A marketplace that feels more like a shell game than a menu of possibilities. Narrow networks often mean consumers can’t actually see the doctors they want. In rural areas, the choices shrink even further. And this year, there’s a looming complication: the enhanced ACA subsidies that kept coverage affordable for millions are set to expire at the end of 2025.

That financial cushion — first introduced under the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act — has masked how expensive healthcare truly is. When it disappears, many families will feel the full cost of care for the first time. But while the system may seem rigged, consumers aren’t powerless. A few disciplined strategies can turn open enrollment from a confusing annual chore into a financially savvy exercise in protection and planning.

The Smart Buyer’s Checklist for Open Enrollment

As a healthcare advisor, I see families pay thousands more each year — not because they’re sicker, but because they’re on the wrong plan or using the right one the wrong way. That’s why a disciplined review during open enrollment can make all the difference.

1. Start with your health, not the brochure.

Good coverage begins with a realistic medical assessment. Match your expected needs like chronic conditions, medications, upcoming procedures to the details of each plan. Without that, you’re comparing numbers in a vacuum.

2. Read the fine print. Always.

Premiums are just the cover price. Deductibles, coinsurance, prescription tiers, and exclusions are where the real costs hide. A low premium with a high deductible can easily become a false economy if you end up using care.

3. Verify your doctors and hospitals every year.

Networks shift constantly. Just because your doctor accepted your plan last year doesn’t mean they still do. Check directly with your provider and confirm in writing.

4. Never leave a gap in coverage.

Even a single uninsured day can expose you to catastrophic financial risk. Think of coverage as a seatbelt: you don’t take it off just because the road looks smooth.

5. Question your broker’s incentives.

Some brokers are paid more for selling certain plans — or represent only a limited roster of insurers. Ask how they’re compensated. You deserve transparency when your health and money are on the line.

6. Focus on hospital coverage above all else.

The biggest exposure isn’t your annual checkup — it’s hospitalization. Confirm that your preferred hospitals, especially for emergencies or chronic care, are covered in-network. That’s where the biggest bills — and biggest risks — hide.

7. Be wary of “off-market” or non-ACA plans.

So-called “alternative” health plans may look attractive but often skip essential benefits like maternity, mental health, or preventive care. If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

The ACA Subsidy Cliff Ahead

The enhanced subsidies that have kept ACA premiums within reach for millions are set to disappear at the end of 2025. Originally introduced under the American Rescue Plan as part of COVID-19 relief and later extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act, these expanded tax credits reduced the share of income people had to devote to benchmark plans and extended financial help to households above 400% of the federal poverty level. Analysts at Health System Tracker, among others, note that these subsidies reshaped affordability across the market, making coverage more accessible for both low-income and middle-income households.

Now, if Congress fails to extend the subsidies, the financial shock will be significant. Premiums after subsidies could climb by 50% to 75% or more depending on income, geography, and plan type. Out-of-pocket burdens would rise sharply as the government covers less of the cost, and millions are projected to drop coverage altogether.

The Bottom Line: Treat Open Enrollment as a Financial Strategy

Healthcare costs have become one of the largest and most unpredictable line items in the modern family budget — rivaling housing and education. Treating open enrollment as part of your broader financial plan isn’t optional anymore; it’s essential risk management.

Two-thirds of bankruptcies in America involve medical debt — a reminder that the right health plan isn’t a luxury; it’s protection. Choosing wisely during Open Enrollment 2025 is one of the most important financial decisions a family can make.

There are at least 3 things wrong with the way we do it now:

1. Too many Michiganders cannot afford the rates DTE and Consumers charge. Too many Michiganders are forced to decide between paying their electric bill and buying groceries. Inflation was the big issue in the 2024 election. It still is and DTE’s and Consumers’ rates are going up at 2 and 3 times faster than other costs.

2. Residential rates are exploding because of unjustified speculative frenzy around AI and data centers. DTE and Consumers want residents to pay for new methane-burning plants to power these data centers without any financial commitments from the big tech companies. Runaway speculation on data centers also strains our ground water and the Great Lakes.

3. Michigan has the worst electric outages in the nation. It takes our utilities an average of 12 hours to recover from outages. Even with a guaranteed 10% return for shareholders, they have failed to make the necessary investments in our grid infrastructure. They just keep blaming the trees.

At the Sierra Club, our mission is to ENJOY and PROTECT the wild places on Earth. We can’t enjoy them if we can’t afford to visit them because we had to pay our utility bill or because we had to throw out a refrigerator of food after an outage. We can’t enjoy them if the new data center has dried up the wetlands next door.

We’re not protecting them if we allow utilities to blow past our commitments to 100% clean energy by 2040. Burning coal and methane is warming up the Great Lakes, making our fisheries even more susceptible to invasive species. Rising temperatures are driving wildfires, flooding, an increase in tornadoes and ice storms that are wreaking havoc on our parks and forests.

The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC), the regulatory agency that approves our utilities’ plans, is holding public hearings about what rules should be used in approving these plans. This is an opportunity for all of us, as members and supporters of the Sierra Club, to exercise our mission to enjoy and protect our wild places.

The money would be used to hire a firm to create a report on the subject.

A working group of Oklahoma researchers and utilities has been assembled to gather information ahead of the study. The OCC partnered with the Hamm Institute for American Energy and identified nuclear energy experts from the University of Oklahoma.

The participants are working as volunteers, said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC’s public utility division. He said Enercon Services, which completed Michigan’s nuclear feasibility study, is among the potential companies eyed for the task.

The request comes as the agency reports funding challenges and staffing shortages.

“ We're unable to fill them because we cannot pay the salaries commensurate to draw people to these jobs,” Commissioner Todd Hiett said. “And so, we're already cutting and operating very thinly already, and maybe to the legislature, a couple hundred thousand dollars doesn't sound like much, but in our world, that's quite a bit.”

The agency could continue its information gathering without hiring a firm, though Argenbright said the product wouldn’t be as comprehensive.

“ We'll create a report regardless of how we deal with the consultant issue,” he said. “But it will be at a different level than it would be with a consultant, where we would have a much deeper dive and a broader range of information that would be able to bring to bear on the report.”

The agency could also use money pulled from its assessment fees of utility companies. Chairman Kim David said that the option would result in higher costs for Oklahoma utility customers.

“ I'd like to make a motion that we requested supplemental appropriation for the $125,000 for the report and put it back in their lap,” David said of the state legislature. “We have a lot of different people that have given a lot of time and effort and energy into this.”

In response to Hiett voicing support for completing a study that the state can one day use, Commissioner Brian Bingman said the OCC should continue its report without hiring a third-party firm.

“ I kind of disagree because I just don't think the legislature is serious about this,” he said.

These high-stakes dialogues, unfolding against a backdrop of escalating global demand and geopolitical tensions, aim to secure a stable and diversified supply of minerals essential for defense, advanced technology, and the burgeoning clean energy transition. The urgency of these conversations underscores a collective recognition that securing these foundational resources is paramount to national economic security and technological sovereignty.

The discussions center on establishing robust frameworks, including potential direct supply agreements and financial mechanisms like guaranteed minimum prices and production-linked tax credits, to enhance domestic stockpiling and production capabilities. As of October 10, 2025, the focus is sharpened by the ongoing regulatory review of a proposed merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American (LSE: AAL), a deal poised to create a global powerhouse in critical minerals, particularly copper. This strategic alignment could profoundly reshape the global critical minerals landscape, offering North America a stronger hand in a market increasingly dominated by a few key players.

Strategic Dialogues and a Shifting Global Landscape

Teck Resources' active participation in these strategic discussions highlights a concerted effort by Western nations to de-risk their critical mineral supply chains, particularly in light of increasing export restrictions from countries like China, which has historically held significant sway over the supply of several key minerals. The company has specifically put forth recommendations for a Canadian Strategic Metals Reserve, advocating for a comprehensive framework that includes floor-price agreements, production-linked tax credits, and federal procurement backing to support the domestic stockpiling of strategic materials such as germanium, antimony, and gallium. These minerals are vital for semiconductors, advanced defense applications, and 5G technology, making their secure supply a matter of national security.

A pivotal element influencing these ongoing discussions is the proposed ""merger of equals"" between Teck Resources and Anglo American. This ambitious plan seeks to forge a new ""global critical minerals champion,"" primarily focused on copper—a metal indispensable for the energy transition—along with other essential metals. The combined entity, tentatively named Anglo Teck Group, would be headquartered in Vancouver. This proposed consolidation is currently undergoing rigorous regulatory review by the Canadian government, which is meticulously assessing its alignment with Canada's critical minerals strategy, national security concerns, including economic security, and its potential to generate significant job creation and economic benefits within Canada. As part of their commitment, the companies have pledged approximately $4.5 billion in Canadian spending over five years, encompassing investments in critical minerals exploration, technological advancements, and upgrades to key facilities like Teck’s Trail smelter.

Teck's CEO, Jonathan Price, has been vocal about the company's potential to meet the germanium needs of North America, and even the entire G7 nations, signaling a clear strategic intent by Western countries to diversify and stabilize their critical mineral supply chains away from over-reliance on dominant suppliers. However, Price has also expressed concerns that Canada's allocated C$4 billion over eight years for critical mineral development falls short when compared to the annual investments made by countries like China. He argues for more ambitious, targeted government incentives and investments to bolster North American critical minerals capacity and streamline cumbersome regulatory processes, which he believes currently lag behind investments in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plants.

The urgency driving these strategic discussions is further underscored by the unprecedented and rapidly escalating global demand for critical minerals. This surge is predominantly fueled by the expansion of the technology sector and, more significantly, the accelerating global transition to renewable energy sources and a low-carbon economy. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite are indispensable for electric vehicle (EV) batteries, with lithium demand alone projected to increase over 40 times its current levels by 2050 to meet net-zero emissions targets. Rare earth elements are crucial for wind turbines and EV motors, while copper remains the backbone of all electricity-related technologies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported robust growth in critical mineral demand in 2023, with projections indicating a nearly quadrupling of overall mineral demand for clean energy technologies by 2040. This escalating demand, coupled with the concentrated refining and processing in a few countries, elevates critical minerals to a paramount national economic and security interest, driving urgent efforts to secure and diversify supply chains.

Potential Winners and Losers in the Critical Minerals Race

The intensified focus on North American critical mineral supply chains, coupled with the proposed Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger, is poised to create a significant ripple effect across various industries, establishing clear winners and losers in the evolving global resource landscape. The primary beneficiaries are expected to be domestic mining companies, technology firms, and defense contractors who can secure reliable access to these essential materials.

Among the mining companies, MP Materials (NYSE: MP), North America's largest rare earths producer, stands to gain substantially. Operating the Mountain Pass mine in California, MP Materials is strategically integrating vertically to produce rare earth magnets domestically, a move bolstered by significant government funding and a supply agreement with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Similarly, USA Rare Earth (USAR), developing a vertically integrated domestic rare earth magnet supply chain, and Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE American: IDR), with its significant rare earth element exploration properties, are well-positioned. Companies like United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), the sole antimony smelter in the U.S. and Mexico, and Trilogy Metals Inc. (NYSEAmerican: TMQ), which has received direct U.S. government investment for its Alaskan copper and zinc projects, will also benefit from the drive for domestic supply. In Canada, Green Technology Metals (ASX: GT1), focusing on lithium projects in Ontario, is pursuing an integrated mine-to-chemical strategy for battery-grade lithium hydroxide, securing an offtake agreement with LG Energy Solution (KRX: 373220).

The proposed $50-53 billion merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American, which is now reported as agreed, is set to create a new mining giant, ""Anglo Teck,"" headquartered in Vancouver. This combined entity, poised to be among the top five global copper producers, will benefit from enhanced portfolio diversification, operational synergies estimated at $800 million in pre-tax annual savings, and increased scale, particularly in copper production. Their strategic focus on copper and other critical minerals positions ""Anglo Teck"" favorably to meet demand from renewable energy, EVs, and green technologies, further strengthening Teck's ongoing discussions with the U.S. and Canada for critical mineral supply. This mega-merger could also trigger further consolidation in the mining industry, making smaller players with valuable deposits attractive acquisition targets.

Conversely, companies heavily reliant on uninterrupted, low-cost critical mineral imports from China, without diversified supply chains, could face increased costs and supply disruptions due to tariffs, export restrictions, and geopolitical tensions. Major mining competitors in copper and zinc, such as BHP (ASX: BHP, NYSE: BHP), Rio Tinto (ASX: RIO, NYSE: RIO), and Glencore (LSE: GLEN), could face heightened competition from the newly formed ""Anglo Teck"" powerhouse. These companies, some of whom previously made bids for Teck, have missed a significant strategic opportunity, potentially forcing them to seek other growth avenues. Furthermore, smaller mining companies, while some may become acquisition targets, could struggle to compete with the sheer scale and financial prowess of the merged entity, particularly in securing capital or developing new large-scale projects.

Wider Significance and Geopolitical Chessboard

The strategic maneuvers by Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and the governments of the U.S. and Canada transcend mere corporate dealings; they represent a critical inflection point in global resource geopolitics. This event fits squarely into broader industry trends defined by the accelerating global energy transition, which demands unprecedented quantities of critical minerals for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced technologies. The projected 400-600% increase in demand for rare earth elements and up to 4,000% for lithium and graphite in EV batteries over the coming decades underscores the profound shift occurring in industrial supply chains.

The ripple effects of securing critical mineral supply chains are vast, impacting competitors, partners, and the overall balance of global power. The geographic concentration of mineral extraction and, more critically, processing—with China holding near-total dominance in rare earth processing and significant shares in strategic battery minerals—has created market fragility and geopolitical leverage. This has spurred Western nations to pursue ""derisking"" strategies, reducing reliance on single dominant suppliers, and ""friendshoring,"" collaborating with trusted allies like Canada and Australia. For competitor nations lacking domestic reserves or processing, disruptions can lead to significant economic impacts, driving them to diversify or face substantial economic output reductions. Conversely, resource-rich developing nations gain increased strategic leverage, becoming key partners in building diversified supply chains.

In response to these trends, governments worldwide are actively developing sophisticated legal frameworks and policy instruments. The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act and the U.S. Critical Minerals Strategy, alongside initiatives like the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), aim to encourage domestic production, processing, research, and recycling, while fostering international cooperation. These policies often include investment incentives, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, and a growing emphasis on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards to ensure responsible and sustainable mining practices. The imposition of export controls by some mineral-rich nations, as seen with graphite, gallium, and germanium, further highlights the urgency of these policy shifts.

Historically, the current drive for critical mineral security echoes past instances of resource nationalism and strategic competition. The U.S. Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1939, enacted at the onset of World War II, and the Defense Production Act of 1950 during the Korean War, both recognized that low commercial reserves posed a direct threat to national security, underscoring a long-standing understanding of material importance for military readiness. The present geopolitical competition over critical minerals is often compared to the 20th-century struggles over oil and gas, now seen as foundational to the 21st-century economy. This era marks a return to state intervention in mineral markets, reversing decades of global economic integration and signifying a fundamental shift in international relations driven by wider geopolitical tensions.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Critical Minerals

The strategic discussions involving Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) and the proposed Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger signify a pivotal moment for the future of critical mineral supply chains in North America. In the short term, the focus will remain on solidifying government initiatives and funding, such as the U.S. Defense Production Act and Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, to accelerate domestic mining, processing, and recycling. Efforts to streamline the notoriously lengthy permitting processes for new mines will be crucial, alongside the establishment of strategic mineral reserves to buffer against immediate supply shocks. The ""friendshoring"" approach, strengthening alliances with trusted partners like Australia, will continue to be a key strategy to diversify supply.

Looking long-term, the vision is to cultivate a robust, sustainable, and self-reliant critical mineral ecosystem across North America. This necessitates building an integrated value chain, from upstream exploration and extraction to midstream processing and refining, which currently remains a significant weak point. A comprehensive circular economy model, encompassing responsible mining, advanced recycling, and urban mining, will be essential for long-term sustainability and reduced environmental impact. Investment in technological innovation, such as deep-sea mineral exploration and alternative materials research, coupled with critical workforce development, will underpin this strategic pivot. The ultimate goal is a fundamental geopolitical rebalancing, reducing reliance on dominant suppliers and establishing new processing hubs within allied nations, a process that will require sustained collaboration over decades.

The market opportunities emerging from this shift are immense, driven by the projected six-fold increase in the energy sector's mineral needs by 2040 and the booming electric vehicle market. This creates significant economic growth and job creation potential across North America, attracting a surge in investment, particularly for projects that qualify for government support. However, formidable challenges persist, including North America's continued heavy reliance on external suppliers for processing, the long lead times and high costs associated with developing new mines, and persistent regulatory and environmental hurdles. Workforce shortages in mining engineering also present a critical bottleneck. The agreed-upon merger between Teck Resources and Anglo American, set to create the ""Anglo Teck"" entity headquartered in Vancouver, is a significant scenario that could accelerate project development and enhance supply chain security, particularly for copper and other critical minerals, aligning with governmental security objectives. However, it will undoubtedly face rigorous regulatory scrutiny to ensure it provides a net benefit to Canada and does not raise undue market concentration concerns.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Securing the Future

The strategic discussions led by Teck Resources (TSX: TECK.A, NYSE: TECK) with the U.S. and Canadian governments, culminating in the proposed Anglo American (LSE: AAL) merger, mark a defining moment in North America's quest for critical mineral security. Key takeaways from these developments underscore a clear and urgent shift towards diversifying supply chains away from concentrated foreign sources, particularly China, to safeguard national economic and defense interests. The escalating global demand for critical minerals, driven by the clean energy transition and advanced technologies, has elevated these resources to a geopolitical imperative, reminiscent of historical struggles for vital raw materials.

Moving forward, the market for critical minerals is set to experience unprecedented growth and transformation. The formation of ""Anglo Teck"" promises a new global powerhouse, particularly in copper, which will significantly bolster North American supply capabilities. However, the path to self-sufficiency is fraught with challenges, including the need for substantial investment in domestic processing infrastructure, streamlined regulatory processes, and a skilled workforce. The emphasis on sustainable and ESG-compliant mining practices will also differentiate North American producers and shape future investment decisions.

The lasting impact of these events will be a more resilient, albeit potentially more expensive, critical mineral supply chain for North America and its allies. This strategic realignment aims to reduce vulnerability to geopolitical disruptions and ensure consistent access to materials vital for future economic growth and technological innovation. Investors should closely monitor regulatory approvals for the Anglo Teck merger, progress on government funding initiatives for critical mineral projects, and the development of new extraction and processing technologies. The long-term success of this strategic pivot will hinge on sustained collaboration between governments and industry, fostering a robust and integrated North American critical minerals ecosystem that can withstand future global shocks.

These pensions are some of the biggest investors in the country, so where they invest matters. Right now, they're using our money to fund Big Oil, other polluters, and greenwashed “climate solutions” that don’t actually cut pollution. That means workers’ hard-earned savings are being used to prop up the industries driving the climate crisis, instead of protecting their future.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Pensions could be part of the solution, investing in ways that secure workers’ retirements and support a safe, livable planet.

That's why the Sierra Club is calling on public pensions to adopt our Climate Solutions Investment Principles — commonsense guidelines that direct money into real climate solutions like clean energy, good union jobs, and resilient communities.

Take action: Add your name now to demand that public pensions invest in a livable future. (If you are a public pension member, please include that in your personal message!)

We are already facing (and paying for) the impacts of climate change. Not only do we face threats to our homes from storms and flooding, but rising temperatures are raising the cost of food, utility bills, and more.

There’s a growing body of research that shows climate change isn’t just an environmental threat, it’s a financial one. The projected financial impacts of the climate crisis means upending the economy and devaluing investments, directly threatening workers' retirement savings. The long-term security of our retirement savings depends on the stability of the economy, which in turn depends on the health of the environmental and social systems that underpin it. To safeguard our ability to retire, we need to decarbonize our economy, and that requires making investments in clean energy and other climate solutions.

Investing in clean, renewable energy isn't just the right thing to do for our planet. It also makes financial sense.

Pensions have a fiduciary duty not only to avoid losses from climate risks, but also to seek out investment opportunities. Credible climate solutions can deliver stable, long-term returns that protect workers’ retirement savings in the long run.

Without redirecting capital toward things like clean energy technologies, green manufacturing, and zero-emissions transportation, pensions risk underinvesting in the energy transition and missing out on the growth that the clean energy economy will generate for decades to come.

Right now, we're seeing the Trump administration roll back 50 years worth of environmental protections. We can and must fight back in every way possible, and that includes investing our tax dollars and our retirement savings in ways that protect the planet and our retirement portfolios

Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.","BROWNSVILLE, Texas - At the southernmost point of Texas, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf, the Port of Brownsville is driving a new era of growth and opportunity. Vessels, trains, and trucks traverse the port’s industrial landscape, signaling more than just cargo in motion. This is the economic engine driving the Rio Grande Valley’s economy.

As the only deepwater seaport located on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Port of Brownsville has become a gateway for trade, a magnet for investment, and a catalyst for opportunity across South Texas. Currently, more than $20 billion in projects are in the pipeline, promising to further transform the economic landscape of South Texas.

The port’s long-term vision is guided by the Brownsville Navigation District Board of Commissioners. This five-member elected body oversees policy, planning, and major investment decisions. The current board includes Chairman Esteban Guerra, Vice Chairman Sergio Tito Lopez, Secretary John Reed, and Assistant Secretaries John Wood and Ernesto Gutierrez. Together, their leadership reflects a strong commitment to economic growth, public trust, and regional impact.

The Port of Brownsville continues to play a central role in the success of the region. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the port climbed to No. 41 among the nation’s 150 maritime ports for waterborne cargo, its highest ranking to date. In 2023, the port moved 11.2 million tons of waterborne cargo, up from 9.1 million tons in 2022.

That momentum carried throughout 2024, with total cargo reaching 28 million tons marking a 57 percent increase from 2023. Operating revenue at the port in 2024 surpassed $30 million for the fourth consecutive year, reaching $43.3 million.

This growth represents more than statistics. It means jobs for families, new business, and broader momentum across South Texas. Every ton of cargo supports a ripple effect that fuels the local economy.

Contributing to the port’s success are consistent investments in infrastructure. A centerpiece of that effort is the Brazos Island Harbor Channel Improvement Project, which will deepen the 17-mile-long ship channel from 42 feet to 52 feet. The increased depth will allow larger vessels to enter more safely, reduce wait times, and improve overall efficiency.

The project is divided into two phases. It’s backed by a Public-Private Partnership involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of Brownsville, and energy company NextDecade. In 2019, NextDecade committed to funding Phase 1, a $400 million investment, which includes deepening the channel near its Rio Grande LNG site and building two ship berths and a turning basin. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company received the contract from NextDecade for work on Phase 1. Phase 2, led by the port and the Corps, is supported by $68 million in federal funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In 2024, a $104 million contract was awarded to Callan Marine Ltd. The estimated completion date of the project is late 2026.

Infrastructure improvements on the port’s land are moving just as quickly. The port has expanded laydown yards, modernized roadways, and improved berths to handle high-volume cargo, including wind energy components. These updates are essential for maintaining the port’s competitiveness in a changing global market.

The Port of Brownsville continues to attract some of the largest private investments in the energy sector. Projects like Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG are shaping the future of U.S. energy exports. Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.

Rio Grande LNG, built by Bechtel Energy Inc., is a natural gas liquefaction and export facility with up to 48 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of potential capacity, making it one of the world’s largest LNG projects in development. Trains 1 through 4, representing about 24 MTPA and $25 billion in investment, are under construction and scheduled to begin operations between 2027 and 2030, supported by customers such as ADNOC, Aramco, Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies. Train 5, with commercial agreements secured from Jera, EQT, and ConocoPhillips, is advancing toward a positive Final Investment Decision, while Trains 6 through 8 are in early development and permitting.

Texas LNG, a project of Glenfarne Energy Transition, is a planned 4 MTPA export terminal at the Port of Brownsville designed to be one of the lowest-emission LNG facilities in the world. It has secured offtake agreements with companies including EQT Corporation, Gunvor Group, Macquarie, and a major European utility. Texas LNG recently cleared a key regulatory milestone with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is targeting a Final Investment Decision by the end of 2025. Kiewit Corporation has been selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, with the project expected to be completed by 2029.

The port is also prioritizing sustainability. From habitat restoration projects to native species conservation, it is working to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with environmental responsibility. These efforts help maintain a balance between progress and preservation.

The port’s location and multimodal access position as a unique link between global trade and emerging industries. It plays a growing role in renewable energy logistics, particularly in the transport of oversized equipment like wind turbines. It’s also supporting the commercial space industry. Just a short distance from SpaceX’s Starbase launch site, the port offers specialized logistics that support space innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With competitive costs, unmatched logistics, available land, and a growing labor force, the Port Brownsville is one of the most attractive locations in the country for nearshoring and industrial investment.

EPA Plans to Redefine a Key Air Permitting Threshold,Not Available,,,,,https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/when-does-construction-really-begin-epa-5543176/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to propose, by 2026, a rule revising the definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) regulations.
How the EPA Has Interpreted “Begin Actual Construction” Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source may not “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.
The EPA concluded that these actions do not constitute “beginning actual construction,” provided that no emissions units or related components are installed.
Implications for Project Planning and Risk The EPA’s evolving interpretation of “begin actual construction” may provide meaningful flexibility for project developers navigating lengthy NSR reviews.
Even modest adjustments to the NSR “begin construction” threshold could materially affect project timing, costs, and compliance strategies in an era of accelerating energy demand and capital-intensive infrastructure development.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to propose, by 2026, a rule revising the definition of “begin actual construction” under the Clean Air Act’s (CAA) New Source Review (NSR) regulations. This threshold determines when a new or modified major stationary source must obtain an NSR permit before starting construction—a distinction with major implications for project sequencing, financing, and regulatory risk.

The EPA’s announcement comes at a critical time for U.S. energy and industrial policy. National electricity demand is projected to rise sharply over the next five years, driven by growth in AI data centers and widespread electrification. The International Energy Agency estimates that data centers alone will account for nearly half of the nation’s total increase in electricity demand through 2030—and, within five years, consume more power than all U.S. production of aluminum, steel, cement, and chemicals combined. In this context, the EPA’s reinterpretation of when “construction” truly begins could have favorable implications for energy and industrial developments nationwide.

How the EPA Has Interpreted “Begin Actual Construction”

Under the CAA, a new or modified major stationary source may not “begin actual construction” without first obtaining an NSR permit.[1] The EPA regulations define this term as “the initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature,” including activities such as installing building supports and foundations, laying underground piping, or constructing permanent storage structures.[2]

Historically, the EPA interpreted this provision broadly. In a March 28, 1986, memorandum from Edward Reich (the “Reich Memo”), the agency concluded that construction of structures intended to accommodate emissions units could itself constitute “actual construction,” even if no emissions equipment had yet been installed.[3] For decades, the regulated community treated this as effectively prohibiting most preparatory construction until an NSR permit was issued, a view reinforced in subsequent memoranda and guidance letters.[4]

In March 2020, however, the EPA under the first Trump administration issued draft guidance that adopted a less restrictive approach.[5] The March 2020 Draft Guidance clarified that:

Source owners or operators may undertake physical on-site activities prior to obtaining an NSR permit—including activities that may be costly, significantly alter the site, or are permanent in nature—provided those activities do not constitute physical construction on an emissions unit, as defined in 40 CFR § 52.21(b)(7).

In contrast to the 1986 Reich Memorandum, an “installation necessary to accommodate” the emissions unit is not considered part of that emissions unit, meaning construction activities involving such accommodations may occur before an NSR permit is obtained.

In short, NSR obligations are triggered only by direct work on emissions units, not by general building or site preparation. The EPA emphasized that any on-site construction undertaken prior to obtaining an NSR permit remains “at risk”—meaning that if a permit is later denied or additional controls are required, developers may face costly redesigns or delays.

The EPA’s 2025 Maricopa County Semiconductor Decision

In September 2025, the EPA reaffirmed this narrower interpretation in response to a request from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department regarding a proposed semiconductor manufacturing complex.[6] The developer sought to construct the building’s “core and shell”—including the foundation, steel frame, and exterior walls—before obtaining an NSR permit, while deferring installation of emissions units, related foundations, and piping until after permit approval.

The EPA concluded that these actions do not constitute “beginning actual construction,” provided that no emissions units or related components are installed. The agency clarified that the term applies specifically to on-site construction of emissions units, not other parts of a facility. The EPA also noted that the 1986 Reich Memo reflected an “overly broad” interpretation by treating structures accommodating emissions units as part of the units themselves.

Although the Maricopa County decision responds to project-specific facts, it aligns with the March 2020 Draft Guidance. The EPA confirmed that it does not plan to finalize the 2020 guidance; instead, the agency intends to initiate a formal rulemaking to revise the NSR program’s definition of “begin actual construction” consistent with this narrower approach. This rulemaking is included in the EPA’s 2025 Spring Agenda, with a proposed rule expected by January 2026 and a final rule targeted for September 2026.

Implications for Project Planning and Risk

The EPA’s evolving interpretation of “begin actual construction” may provide meaningful flexibility for project developers navigating lengthy NSR reviews. A clarified, narrower definition could allow certain preparatory site and building activities to proceed without triggering NSR requirements. However, the EPA has stressed that any such activities remain “at risk.”

Developers in Texas should also consider recent state-level changes. In 2019, the Texas Legislature amended the Texas Clean Air Act through House Bill 2726 (codified at Tex. Health & Safety Code § 382.004), authorizing limited “construction at risk.” Under this law, applicants for a permit amendment may begin construction once the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issues a draft permit, rather than waiting for final issuance. The statute requires compliance with federal law and specifies that all work proceeds at the applicant’s own risk. If the EPA finalizes its narrower definition of “begin actual construction,” TCEQ’s permitting approach may adjust accordingly, potentially broadening the range of activities it may approve before final permit issuance.

Looking ahead, the EPA’s forthcoming rule is expected to clarify when NSR preconstruction obligations attach and align federal policy with practical construction sequencing. The outcome will be closely watched by developers, permitting authorities, and environmental advocates. Even modest adjustments to the NSR “begin construction” threshold could materially affect project timing, costs, and compliance strategies in an era of accelerating energy demand and capital-intensive infrastructure development.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases have ended, but state-level programs still offer relief to some buyers. Depending on where you live, you might still qualify for thousands in state tax breaks. However, you could also pay higher registration fees than your gasoline-driving neighbors.

The change highlights a major transition in U.S. transportation policy. States are trying to balance environmental goals with the need to fund roads and bridges.

Federal Credits End as Congress Pulls Plug

Congress ended the Biden-era EV tax credits on Sept. 30. Those credits offered up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used models. The end of the federal program caused a surge in last-minute EV purchases as consumers rushed to beat the deadline. Analysts now predict a temporary dip in nationwide EV sales.

Still, several states — including Colorado, California, and New Jersey — continue offering rebates or tax incentives to maintain sales momentum.

Balancing Incentives with New Fees

The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, notes that state EV policies often conflict. While incentives encourage electric adoption, other laws impose higher registration or “road use” fees. States justify these costs because EV owners do not pay gasoline taxes, which fund most transportation infrastructure.

Oklahoma drivers, for example, pay an annual EV fee of $110 on top of registration costs. Lawmakers say that keeps road funding balanced while encouraging responsible electric growth.

The Bigger Picture — Infrastructure and Fairness

As EV adoption grows, states face pressure to replace lost fuel-tax revenue. The transition requires creative policy solutions that reward clean energy without draining highway funds. Many transportation experts predict more states will adopt mileage-based user fees within the next decade.

The debate reflects a crossroads for America’s energy and transportation policy — one where sustainability and fiscal responsibility must meet in the middle.",,N,,2025-10-10 13:06:12.510549

Both Ford and General Motors had ideas about how to offer a slight extension to folks, but both companies have officially nixed those plans; GM called it off on Wednesday this week, and Reuters reports that Ford just eliminated its offer on Friday, October 10.

GM told Reuters that, ""after further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit.” A Ford spokesperson said, “Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today.”

The two companies originally came up with a creative idea to work around the demise of the tax credit, at least for those vehicles still on the lot today: both the Ford and GM in-house lending arms were planning to initiate the purchase of EVs in inventory while the credit was still applicable, and then pass those savings onto the customers who would ultimately lease the vehicles.

Pushback came from the Republican U.S. senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio. Moreno and fellow senator John Barrasso (R-MD) wrote a public letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent concerning the matter.

“It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal down payment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months,” the senators wrote. “Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors.”

After GM pulled back from the program, Moreno expressed his happiness in an interview with Reuters.

It doesn’t matter if it’s a more consensus-minded society like Sweden, or top-down authoritarianism like China. Governments pick winners and losers. In America, those losers are anyone in the EV supply chain.

There’s a new article out that talks about the ‘Battery Belt,’ which is a useful neologism for the mostly rural and historically Republican areas that were supposed to be the source of batteries for future electric cars. That’s not happening at the speed most predicted, so what happens to those communities?

The Morning Dump is a news roundup, and all the news today is built around batteries. We know what’s happening, but who is to blame?

Is it the automakers who had too lofty ambitions? Is it the politicians who halted an industrial policy before it could be started? And where does this go?

‘That’s On Everybody’s Mind, Quite Frankly’

Back in 2022, Ford announced it would spend billions building a battery and EV truck-making facility in Stanton, Tennessee. This small town of 450 people would suddenly get thousands of new workers.

This facility was to be a part of the Battery Belt and, maybe, still will be. Ford keeps delaying the project, just like nearly every major automaker with EV ambitions in the United States.

What if it never happens? From the Reuters piece on the dashed dreams of the Battery Belt, that’s the question:

The uncertain fate of these massive, high-tech factories and their employment has rattled the small rural communities that spent years hitching their economic futures to these projects.

“That’s on everybody’s mind, quite frankly,” said Allan Sterbinsky, who retired as mayor of Stanton in December and advocated for the site for years before Ford came to town. Some residents worry that Ford will never follow through on the plant, the former mayor says. Others hope the company will repurpose the 3,600-acre site if demand doesn’t increase for EVs.

A Ford spokesperson pointed to the automaker’s community work in Stanton, including grants to public safety organizations as part of a broader $9 million commitment to the area.

Essentially, the industry was preparing to build enough battery capacity to cover roughly 80% of the current car market, or around 13 million cars. Now? Maybe a quarter of that will be necessary.

What happens to these communities? How did we end up here?

‘Electric Vehicle Subsidies Were… Distorting The Market’

I have already written at length here about how electric vehicle subsidies were, ultimately, bad politics, even if you think they were good governance.

Ford and General Motors thought they’d be clever and use a loophole in the IRS guidance around the ending of the IRA tax credit to extend it for a few months. Both GM and Ford have bailed on those plans after two Republican Senators cried foul.

Here’s the letter from the Senators that explains some of their reasoning:

We write to alert you to a serious violation of Congressional intent that threatens great harm to U.S. taxpayer dollars and ask for your immediate assistance in rectifying this problem.

As you know, Congress recently enacted Public Law 119-21, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, giving working class families massive tax relief, ending the Green New Scam, and fully funding our border security and national security needs. As part of this law, Congress amended Sections 25E, 30D, and 45W of the tax code, which collectively provide tax credits for the purchase of certain “clean vehicles.” These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off.

Senator Moreno is a car dealer, so you might expect he’d have some sort of sympathy for dealers or automakers who are now trying to move these vehicles (that the previous government pushed).

I think the bit about how these subsidies were “distorting the market for automakers” kind of gives the game away. A 2023 report from Climate Power showed that there were 24 planned battery projects and 11 electric vehicle projects in rural areas, representing more than $20 billion in investments. Because it’s hard to build plants in urban areas, it’s not surprising that most of these plans were in Republican districts. They are in a mix of historically swing and not-so swing Republican states, however.

The political ramifications of potentially killing many of these projects seem, from the Republican side at least, not to be as big of a deal as continuing the tax credit.

‘It’s Going To Be Smaller, Way Smaller Than We Thought’

Credit to Ford CEO Jim Farley for having a quote for every topic. While recently expanding on his belief that we need more skilled tradespeople (we do), he also made a point of being honest about how expectations for EV adoption were not matched to the reality of consumer demand.

Per CNBC:

Farley on Tuesday said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 10% to 12% this month — which is expected to be a record — to 5% after the incentive program ends.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said during a Ford event about promoting skilled trades and workers in Detroit. “We’re going to find out in a month. I wouldn’t be surprised that the EV sales in the U.S. go down to 5%.”

Farley said the industry learned that “partial electrification,” such as hybrids, are easier for customers to accept for the time being.

Even if the Democrats won every seat in every election and the White House, it’s not like all that battery capacity we were building would have exactly been necessary (some plans were being paused before the election). We’d have ended up somewhere in between, or at least closer to in between than where we are now.

Either way, the post-Tesla overheated projections definitely contributed to this mess.

‘It’s Not Something (We), In Any Way, Shape, Or Form, Expect To Give Up’

Could General Motors do the one thing it doesn’t normally do? Could GM be right on the technology and ahead of the market, and not suddenly retreat at the first sign of an obstacle?

Here’s a quote from a Detroit Free Press interview with GM President of North America Duncan Alred:

Still, GM invested significant money and planning to offer the range of EVs it has today. Though the industry is bracing for an EV sales slump, GM’s leaders insist that investing deeply and early in a broad range of electric offerings was not a mistake.

“We believe EVs will remain a strong part of the GM portfolio. Quite honestly, it’s one of the reasons why our market share has grown so much this year,” Aldred said. “It’s not something (we), in any way, shape or form, expect to give up.”

Year to date, GM estimates that its 17.2% market share across vehicle propulsion systems is the highest it’s been in 10 years. So far this year, EV total sales more than doubled to 144,668 vehicles.

Cool? Cool! GM is already deeply invested in its EV project and has approximately a dozen models out there, compared to just three for Ford. It also has affordable vehicles like the reborn Bolt coming to the market.

EVs are the right car for a lot of people, including consumers who haven’t been able to afford one yet.

If everyone else (other than Tesla) is retreating to some degree, it’s maybe not the worst position for GM to be in to soak up all that excess market share.

GM never received the federal funding and will work with the DOE and Piston to determine next steps on closing out the programs, Fowle said.
GM's retrenchment follows Stellantis' cancellation of hydrogen fuel cell development efforts, announced this summer.
Automakers including GM, Stellantis and Toyota invested substantially in hydrogen as a viable propulsion technology, especially for heavy-duty vehicles.
""High costs and limited hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. has limited consumer adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles.""","Crain’s confirmed with GM that its project with Southfield-based Piston Automotive, which was to create more than 140 jobs at the former Michigan State Fairgrounds site in Detroit, would be scrapped. Crain's first reported in May that the project was paused due to regulatory uncertainty.

GM spokesman Stuart Fowle said policy changes and the automaker's reassessment of its portfolio triggered the decision. The lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles are key reasons for the shift.

""Certainly the decisions of the DOE are an element of that overall climate but not the only driver,"" Fowle said. ""We want to prioritize the engineering talent and resources and everything we have to continuing to advance EVs given hydrogen is in a different spot.""

The U.S. Department of Energy awarded GM $30 million in grants for its hydrogen fuel cell programs in March 2024 as part of $750 million in total funding for 52 projects around the country. The DOE announced last week it would terminate 321 financial awards worth $7.56 billion, but did not specify the projects.

GM never received the federal funding and will work with the DOE and Piston to determine next steps on closing out the programs, Fowle said. ""Today we shared the news with employees. Next step is discussions with external stakeholders,"" he said.

GM's retrenchment follows Stellantis' cancellation of hydrogen fuel cell development efforts, announced this summer. Automakers including GM, Stellantis and Toyota invested substantially in hydrogen as a viable propulsion technology, especially for heavy-duty vehicles. But the timeline for market traction and return on investment has repeatedly been pushed out.

""While hydrogen holds promise for specific high-demand industrial applications like backup power, mining, and heavy trucking, the path to reaching a sustainable business in fuel cells is long and uncertain,"" GM said in a statement posted on its website. ""High costs and limited hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. has limited consumer adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles.""

Crain's first reported a year ago about the GM-Piston project in Detroit. The 292,550-square-foot building along Eight Mile Road was expected to serve as the automaker's first standalone hydrogen plant.

GM said it will ""work with Piston to determine another use for the facility.""

This isn’t the first obstacle the Park Service has endured under Trump’s second term.
National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service.","This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.

This summer, national park employees and visitors were asked to do something highly unusual: report any signs that failed to make America look great. The effort, stemming from an executive order from President Donald Trump, has already resulted in the removal of signs about the horrors of slavery, massacres of Indigenous peoples, and the threat of climate change, even on lands directly in harm’s way.

Consider Acadia National Park in Maine. More intense storms and rising seas are accelerating erosion and killing native plants along its iconic coastline. Warmer temperatures are assisting the spread of an invasive insect that totally wiped out the park’s red pines. And yet last month, park employees removed multiple signs explaining how climate change was contributing to these changes.

“Getting access to that information when you’re right there is a way to see with your own eyes what is going on,” said Chellie Pingree, a Democratic representative from Maine. The removed signs didn’t just educate visitors about environmental problems — they also outlined steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions, such as taking a shuttle bus instead of a personal vehicle to visit popular park sites.

Trump’s executive order in March directed the Interior Department to remove descriptions that “inappropriately disparage Americans past or living” and focus instead on “the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people.” The directive also demanded an emphasis on “the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.” Even items at national park gift shops were subject to review.

This isn’t the first obstacle the Park Service has endured under Trump’s second term. Due to federal cuts, the National Park Service has lost a quarter of its permanent staff, many of whom worked to preserve species and natural features in the parks over the long term. Employees at Acadia are stretched very thin, with more than 60 vacant year-round staff positions, according to Todd Martin, senior program manager for the Northeast for the National Parks Conservation Association. The administration has also proposed cutting the Park Service’s budget for 2026 by $1.2 billion.

Gutting those resources, particularly at a time when climate change is altering national parks, means that the very beauty Trump wants to highlight is at risk of disappearing.

National parks have warmed at double the rate of the rest of the country, according to research from Patrick Gonzalez, formerly the principal climate change scientist at the National Park Service. “More severe heating occurs in national parks because extensive areas of the national park system are located in extreme environments — in the Arctic, at high elevations, and in the arid Southwest,” he said.

Some of the parks’ namesake features could be lost: the glaciers of Montana’s Glacier National Park could vanish within decades, the Joshua trees could eventually disappear at California’s Joshua Tree National Park, and more severe wildfires have already taken out a fifth of California’s famous sequoias. Warming temperatures could hurt Yellowstone National Park’s bison population, and sea level rise is reducing habitat for the Florida panther in the Everglades.

“We as a country worry about losing these spectacular resources, and people want to know what the Park Service is doing to keep them alive and to make sure they survive past this generation,” said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs at the National Parks Conservation Association. “Hiding this information from the public is just not what the Park Service is about.”

Some signs explaining environmental threats came out of the Park Service’s climate change response strategy created under President Barack Obama in 2010, which placed a focus on communicating the risks of global warming — and what could be done about it — to the public. The interpretive signs were carefully vetted by scientists and other experts to ensure they were accurate before they went up, according to Gonzalez.

It’s unclear how many of these signs will be removed as a result of Trump’s executive order, but many have been brought to the administration’s attention. Park officials at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina, flagged a plaque explaining how fossil fuels cause air pollution that harms plants and animals. At Everglades National Park, an employee noted that signs about farming and urban development damaging the land “could be conceived as being disparaging to the development of industrial America.” Meanwhile, at Cape Hatteras National Seashore on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, an employee wondered if a sign about sea level rise threatening the Ocracoke ponies’ habitat “reduces the focus on grandeur, beauty, and abundance.”

Other environmental information has already disappeared from park signs. In July, Muir Woods National Monument in Northern California removed its “history under construction” exhibit that had added historical and cultural context to its existing signage. The new information had included explanations of how the Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo peoples maintained the land for centuries through cultural burns, as well as informing visitors that the conservationist Gifford Pinchot, who worked to preserve Muir Woods, also promoted eugenics.

Park Service staff have told Brengel that being asked to report and censor their own signs has been a morale killer. “They’re devastated,” she said. She’s heard that some parks have been told not to remove any more signs because of “bad publicity,” but also that many parks west of the Mississippi have been told to keep flagging signs to comply with the directive.

“This is not over,” Brengel said. “They’re planning to censor more parks. It’s just a matter of time at this point.”

None of the national parks Grist contacted commented on the environment-related signs that were removed or flagged for review, deferring to the Department of Interior or the National Park Service. (National parks employees have been told not to talk to journalists, sources told Grist.)

“Thanks to President Donald Trump, Interior is ensuring that the American people are no longer being fed the lies of the delusional Green New Scam,” said Aubrie Spady, the Interior’s deputy press secretary, in a statement. “The content was taken down because this administration believes in only administering facts based on real science to the American public, not brainless fear-mongering rhetoric used to steal taxpayer dollars.”

Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the National Park Service, put it a more neutral way: “The president has directed federal agencies to review interpretive materials to ensure accuracy, honesty, and alignment with shared national values.”

The sign removals are part of a larger pattern to hide information about climate change from public view. In his second term, Trump has launched an assault on climate science, deleting landmark climate reports, slashing funding for climate research, and ending a program that tracked the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. Language about the changing climate has vanished from federal websites, including entire pages about it on the Park Service website.

In response, scientists, academics, and other volunteers have worked to save the data that’s being lost and try to make it available for the public to find again.

The erasure of “negative” stories at national parks has spurred another such initiative, called “Save Our Signs.” The goal is to crowdsource photos of signs from National Park Service sites all around the country to create a publicly accessible collection. So far, Save Our Signs has received more than 10,000 photos from hundreds of sites, said Jenny McBurney, a government publications librarian who helped start the project.

Politicians are also pushing back. Last week, Pingree and dozens of representatives signed a letter to National Park Service director Jessica Bowron condemning the removal of historical signs and asking for detailed information on all the signs that had been flagged for violations, altered, or removed.

McBurney said that the Save Our Signs project is still accepting photos, even though it’s already seen an outpouring of support. “You can just tell that people really care about our parks, and they want to make sure that this important information is preserved.”",https://dxu6k2kio89d8.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/07133340/Acadia-climate-change-sign-NPS-Jay-Elhard-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:22.455382

The site features more than half a million board feet of southern yellow pine in walls and ceilings, lower‑carbon concrete, generous daylighting and over 170 EV charging stalls, all intended to test which sustainability measures can scale across Amazon’s global portfolio.

“We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,” said Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s vice president of global realty. “DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas, not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them,” Mallory said. Amazon will treat the site as an operational testbed, gathering the complex data needed to decide which materials and systems merit wider rollout.

Wood Central understands that timber is DII5’s defining feature. Mass timber — engineered by laminating standard softwood into large panels and beams — delivers structural performance comparable to concrete and steel while dramatically reducing embodied carbon and storing atmospheric CO₂ in long‑lived building elements.

Kristen Dotson, Amazon’s principal for sustainable buildings, said locking carbon into timber for 50 to 100 years creates a tangible carbon “bank,” preventing that CO₂ from returning to the atmosphere and materially lowering a building’s lifecycle emissions. “The game‑changing part around mass timber is that it’s taking a ready commodity and turning it into this structural element that can replace much of the concrete and steel that goes into a building,” Dotson said.

DII5 pairs its timber structure with proven performance systems: heat pumps, clerestory daylighting and LED controls to cut operational energy; a 15,000‑gallon rainwater capture and filtration system for toilet reuse; and more than 170 EV chargers supporting roughly 125 electric delivery vehicles already on site. Local fabricators supplied and finished the timber components, and lower‑carbon concrete technologies were used where concrete remained necessary.

Marty Brennan, design architect and sustainability lead at ZGF, described DII5 as both a design and supply‑chain experiment. “The scheme brings together numerous partners from across the building industry to create a welcoming experience of light, wood, and native prairies,” he said, reflecting an intent to pair environmental performance with material and spatial quality.

Amazon will judge DII5 against measurable outcomes: construction impacts, lifecycle carbon, cost, fire performance, durability and constructability.

The region has lagged behind the rest of the world in the adoption of the renewable energy sector, and this new development fosters international cooperation that could catapult green hydrogen into the global energy conversation. The new report comes to us from H2-diplo and is called the “Green Hydrogen and Regional Cooperation in Central Asia” study. It aims to develop green hydrogen possibilities for nations in Central Asia.

The report highlights the role that green hydrogen could play in transforming the energy sector in Central Asia

The world has embraced the potential that the green hydrogen sector has in troves and has implemented measures to develop the technology enabling us to finally make use of green hydrogen in the energy sector.

Despite Central Asia’s untapped wind and solar potential, renewable energy accounts for 2% of energy generation in the region as of 2022. Green hydrogen could alter that percentage significantly, as the report states.

Despite the overwhelming global narrative that has emerged recently, calling for a more practical approach to the hydrogen sector, most nations in Central Asia have not been able to take advantage of the new approach to the energy sector. The report calls for significant investments from international bodies that could foster growth for the hydrogen sector in the region.

Kazakhstan recently hosted the second Central Asian Regional Forum on Decarbonization Diplomacy

Kazakhstan is the Central Asian nation leading the push to integrate the hydrogen sector into its plans for the future of the energy sector. The event in Astana saw more than 150 participants from the government, international organizations, business, academia, and civil society.

Among the topics discussed at the Central Asian Regional Forum on Decarbonization Diplomacy were:

National hydrogen roadmaps

renewable grid integration

inclusivity and investment conditions

Regional certification for a trusted hydrogen market

Exemplifying international cooperation is key to the Central Asian region, as proven by the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Kazakh Ministry of Energy and the German Hydrogen Diplomacy Office, which happened at the event. Green hydrogen has come exceedingly far in a very short time frame as certain European nations aim to boost aid for green hydrogen and ammonia-powered ships.

Among the high-level government attendees was none other than Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Issetov, who delivered the opening address.

“This gathering comes at a crucial time across the globe. The energy transition is no longer a distant vision for Central Asia. This transition is not just about reducing emissions. It is about economic resilience, regional stability and global relevance. When we talk about energy transition, a key question arises: who will drive this process? It is about people ready to bring the green strategy to life. (…) We believe that we have to invest in our human capital” – Kazakhstan Deputy Foreign Minister Arman Issetov

He also noted that by fostering regional cooperation in training and research, Central Asia has the potential to dominate the hydrogen sector for the foreseeable future.

Multiple species of great whales—North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and minke whales—are currently experiencing unusual mortality events off the East Coast.
But again, there is no evidence that offshore wind development is the cause.
Offshore wind development is a critical component of mitigating climate change, and responsible offshore wind development enjoys broad support from coastal communities and environmental organizations.","Federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths. In fact, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association (NOAA) Fisheries, the agency responsible for marine mammal conservation and management, explains in its FAQ on offshore wind and whales: “There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.” Earlier this year, the U.S. Government Accountability Office similarly reported that NOAA Fisheries “does not anticipate any death or serious injury to whales from offshore wind related actions.” And the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)—the agency responsible for siting and permitting offshore wind projects—stated in 2024 that “[a]ll current evidence indicates that there are no links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, including site characterization surveys.”

Independent scientists have likewise found “no evidence” that offshore wind development resulted in whale deaths or strandings (when a whale is found onshore due to injury, distress, disease, or death).

There is simply no credible evidence to support claims that offshore wind has caused whale deaths. Over the last 10 months, President Trump and others in his administration have implied or alleged that offshore wind projects harm whales and that environmental reviews and other permitting processes for offshore wind were rushed or carried out improperly. Yet the administration has not identified a single piece of evidence or produced a credible scientific study to back up its claims.

On day one of his second term, President Trump issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to assess the impacts of offshore wind projects on wildlife, including marine mammals, but no assessment has been released. And on April 16, 2025, BOEM ordered the Empire Wind project off Long Island to halt construction while the agency “address[ed] feedback it has received, including from [NOAA], about the environmental analyses for that project[.]” However, the agency never provided an explanation as to why work was stopped or what feedback was received from NOAA, beyond publishing online an almost entirely redacted report. BOEM eventually allowed Empire Wind to resume construction.

Offshore wind projects undergo extensive multiyear reviews and are subject to a variety of laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires agencies to review the environmental impacts of development, and the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, which require protective measures to help ensure that activities do not harm protected whales. Existing federal permitting requirements provide a robust and established way for federal agencies to engage with developers, state and local agencies, Tribes, and the public to address potential impacts to the environment, national security, and other uses of the ocean from offshore wind projects.

These processes are proven and have helped protect wildlife and improve government decisionmaking for decades. Not to mention that the Trump administration is speaking out of both sides of its mouth—decrying multiyear offshore wind permitting processes as “rushed” while rolling back some of the very same permitting requirements for the fossil fuel industry, even though offshore oil and gas activities pose well-documented and major threats to whales like Cook Inlet beluga whales and Gulf of Mexico Rice’s whales.

Multiple species of great whales—North Atlantic right whales, humpback whales, and minke whales—are currently experiencing unusual mortality events off the East Coast. Such events are declared when there is a marked increase in death, injury, or morbidity (defined as sublethal injury or illness) for a particular mammal species. But again, there is no evidence that offshore wind development is the cause. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are by far the largest direct human sources of mortality for most whales. These two threats are pushing North Atlantic right whales to the brink of extinction.

For humpbacks, roughly 40 percent of necropsies show harm from vessel strike or entanglement. Necropsies of minke whales indicate that many animals are suffering from infectious diseases or have been impacted by human interaction. The other large whale species found off the East Coast—blue whales, fin whales, and sei whales—are all listed as endangered due to the lasting impacts of industrial whaling and are similarly impacted by human activities.

Climate change exacerbates the stress on whales. As ocean warming changes the distribution of key prey, large whale distributions are shifting. These shifts have brought whales into greater conflict with human activities like fishing and vessels and increased their susceptibility to malnourishment, poor health, and vessel strikes.

Rather than tilting at windmills, the Trump administration could take real steps to address the actual causes of whale injuries and deaths on the East Coast. Science confirms the value of vessel speed restrictions in reducing deaths of large whale species and sea turtles from vessel collisions. If it adopted additional 10-knot speed limits for certain vessels in whale habitat, NOAA would meaningfully reduce vessel strike risk.

The administration could also address entanglement in vertical buoy lines by issuing stronger regulations and investing in ropeless (on-demand) fishing systems for the American lobster and Jonah crab fisheries to offset the economic burden of obtaining new gear.

And, if the administration cares about the long-term health of whale populations in a changing climate, federal agencies should continue to advance responsibly developed offshore wind projects that include mitigation and monitoring requirements to protect whales and other wildlife. Offshore wind development is a critical component of mitigating climate change, and responsible offshore wind development enjoys broad support from coastal communities and environmental organizations.

Instead of attacking the renewable energy sources that we need to avoid climate catastrophe and firing the very scientists working to monitor and protect our beloved whales, the administration should implement science-based protections for these iconic marine mammals.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/seismictesting_549495370_900x600.jpg?h=b69e0e0e&itok=zRbJyx7V,N,,2025-10-10 13:08:10.196826

All approved 2026–29 utility plans and stipulated agreements between utilities and advocates can be found on the ICC’s Stakeholder Advisory Group website.

Consistently considered the key to our clean energy future and the lowest-cost energy resource, energy efficiency reduces household utility bills and energy demand, creates good-paying jobs, and reduces pollution from our buildings and strain on our energy systems. Since energy efficiency programs launched in 2008, they have demonstrated how critical more robust Illinois utilities’ investments are and how they can—and must—be improved.

Although arduous, the 2026–29 energy efficiency plan negotiations toward settlement were successful in modeling that under inclusive and accessible energy decision-making processes, historic gains can be made to ensure clean and efficient technology investments benefit all—especially communities that have been disenfranchised by the legacy energy system.

Key highlights of the approved negotiated portfolios

An increase in income-qualified (low-income) energy efficiency program investments by $25.4 million per year above their 2022–25 portfolio commitments and $41.7 million per year more than companies had first proposed to spend before negotiations began

Nearly $408 million per year invested in workforce training programs and initiatives to expand or launch new local and diverse businesses and community-action agencies in energy efficiency

A significantly expanded focus for electric utilities on installing heat pumps for electrification and in affordable multifamily buildings with highly inefficient electric resistance heat (i.e., window units and baseboards)

Sunsetting methane gas furnace rebates for higher-income residential Ameren customers after 2027 in light of federal appliance standards and focusing on building weatherization improvements for all Illinois gas consumers

Increasing ComEd’s focus on all-electric new construction/gut rehab programming and Ameren’s new income-qualified electrification program for propane-heated homes

Other successful outcomes include greater investments into small business, commercial, and industrial programs; more robust health and safety budgets to address pre-weatherization issues like mold and roof repair; and improved data reporting metrics to better hold utilities accountable to the effectiveness of their programs.

NRDC has estimated that through these programs, the equipment and building upgrades invested each year will, over their lifetime, save enough electricity to power roughly three million homes and save enough gas to heat about half a million homes annually. That’s the annual carbon pollution equivalent of 122,358 average gas-powered cars!

But the work doesn’t end here

The Illinois General Assembly is expected to gather during October 2025’s veto legislative session to reexamine Senate Bill 25 (SB25), a version of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act that the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition introduced last session—which was blocked before a vote could make it law on the final day of session.

SB25 makes critical improvements to the state’s electric energy efficiency program by increasing energy savings targets to 2 percent of total utility sales, introducing a goal to reduce peak demand on the grid, tripling minimum requirements for income-qualified investment, and increasing the amount of building electrification utilities can facilitate.

Blame Democrats",Sabrina Cynova,,,,,https://www.detroitchamber.com/oct-10-2025-this-week-in-government-dont-like-decoupling/,"Now, under state law, the federal tax changes will not have bearing on state taxes.
But, Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, is wary of a new economic development tool in general.
Additionally, the bill would require lawmakers to submit their request before the date the budget bill containing it was passed by their chamber for the first time.
“This legislation will help address that in the future.” The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has not reported receiving millions of that grant back to the corporation.
Anthony said she also didn’t want to create a cumbersome process for organizations that are traditionally overlooked in the state budget.","Policies like decoupling are “what you get when you support Democrats,” House Speaker Matt Hall said during a press conference on Tuesday.

After the budget passed, business groups pushed back on the plan to separate federal and state tax code, which was an integral part of the plan to provide funding for roads. A coalition of business chambers and stakeholder groups said it would make taxes more confusing and expensive for businesses, thereby making Michigan less competitive.

The legislation, HB 4961, now PA 24, responds to the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that allows businesses to pay less in taxes federally, around $677 million less to the state. Now, under state law, the federal tax changes will not have bearing on state taxes.

“These business groups support Democrats. Some of them even endorsed Gretchen Whitmer,” Hall said. “That’s what you get when you support Democrats… If you look at the Republican plan, the Republican plan was to eliminate $3 billion of waste, fraud, and abused. We showed how we could do that and fix the roads.”

He said that any plan that raised taxes for working Michigan residents, such as increasing the gas tax or raising registration fees, was untenable to Republicans.

“Actual working people and seniors don’t have lobbyists,” he said. “One thing we’re never going to have is increases in our hunting and fishing fees… as long as I’m speaker.”

Hall said he was willing to stand up to the interests of business groups.

“They don’t like my position on getting rid of the MEGA credits either,” he said. “The ones that get the MEGA credits and the ones that are affected by decoupling, they overlap a lot.”

Hall also touted other Republican wins in the budget, including no taxes on overtime and tips, record education spending– including money for the school safety and mental health, requiring 80% occupancy in state-owned buildings, eliminating unfilled full-time equivalent employees and putting money into the Public Safety Trust Fund.

“Our priorities were public safety, education and fixing roads. Democrats tried to tell you that you had to pick between fixing the roads and funding education, I always said we didn’t have to,” he said. “Decoupling helped us accomplish those priorities.”

The budget process also brought about greater transparency, Hall said.

“You saw the Democrats do some transparency in this budget,” he said. “The reason that these negotiations went on as long as they did…we were just at a standstill for a very long time over transparency.”

He went on to say that legislation was coming that would make the transparency requirements for public hearings and disclosure prior to the budget passing permanent.

During this budget process, Hall said Republicans achieved what they set out to do when they walked off the floor last term during lame duck, which was earned sick time, tipped minimum wage, and funding for local roads.

Next year’s budget will have more cuts, Hall said.

“We’re right sizing this budget,” he said. “We’re getting value for your dollars, and we’re setting priorities… this is the trajectory we’re moving on to eliminate further waste, fraud, and abuse next year.”

In a post-Strategic Outreach and Attraction Revenue fund Michigan, the question stands: If not SOAR money for economic development, then what’s next?

The SOAR fund was ended in the budget passed early Friday morning, not depositing its annual $500 million. Some lawmakers are calling for a brand-new tool to attract businesses and others want to see other issues addressed in efforts to attract businesses without subsidies.

With the critics of SOAR, one theme stands: getting rid of “picking winners and losers.”

In TV interviews on Friday following the passage, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said the next challenge facing the state was not ceding the state’s “competitive edge” in creating more jobs in the state (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 6, 2025).

Stacey LaRouche, press secretary for Whitmer, said Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, and House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, have agreed to pass legislation before the end of the calendar year that would “make it easier to create and retain good-paying, high-skill jobs in Michigan.”

Hall told reporters on Tuesday that his preferred route in economic development would be through a bill not yet introduced by Rep. Mike Hoadley, R-Au Gres, that would change the High-Wage Incentive for Regional Employment program.

Hall also called for eliminating SOAR altogether outside of just defunding it as well as repealing mega credits.

He said the state needs a tool that can prove the jobs are being created and are high-paying, especially with promises from President Donald Trump to help Michigan land deals, and that economic development will take precedence over other conversations.

Hall said one economic development bill from Rep. Alabas Farhat, D-Dearborn, HB 5073, that would raise the tax cap for the transformational brownfield plans, is not a priority he would like to chase now.

Farhat was the first to say early Friday morning after the House passed the budget bills that the Legislature was going to pivot its focus to economic development (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Oct. 2, 2025).

Farhat told Gongwer News Service on Tuesday that the next economic development plan is a mix of addressing seemingly outside issues from direct business, like the roads deal to make infrastructure changes, but also in creating something new for business attraction.

“I’ll continue having these conversations around what that the new tools look like, but I’ll definitely say we’re going to want something that holds developers accountable to any promises they make, keep employers accountable, but it also spurs growth, and that is something that’s going to generate a positive impact,” Farhat said.

Farhat said the state cannot simply “do nothing” and allow families to face economic uncertainty.

But, Rep. Dylan Wegela, D-Garden City, is wary of a new economic development tool in general.

“The best thing that can happen right now is for us not to replace SOAR with anything,” Wegela said. “There are already a million different ways businesses can get help from the state, and we should be repealing those instead of expanding them.”

There are more tax abatements and “tools” that businesses have at their disposal than he can name, Wegela said, making it “absurd” to him that there would be a need to replace SOAR with something else.

He said economic development should not be about handouts, but instead about making life more affordable for Michiganders including addressing public housing, having strong unions, funding roads, in which he said the funding plan probably does not go far enough for all the infrastructure needs, and other “basics” that result in a better economic impact.

The state can’t meet basic functionalities, Wegela said, but is planning again about how to build more tools for businesses.

“To be quite frank, I don’t care about giving businesses more tools, I care about working-class people having things that their taxes paid for first,” Wegela said. “The state hasn’t learned that lesson. I don’t think SOAR going away is going to (teach) that lesson. I guarantee you there is going to be some new magic wand that’s going to make business come here.”

Sen. Mallory McMorrow, D-Royal Oak, said the Legislature is in a “healthy place” where they can acknowledge that while SOAR was well-intentioned, it’s not working and look to the future instead.

She touted her legislation, SB 213 and SB 214 , as something that could change the course of development with the 10-year strategic plan along with a board that would develop and oversee the plan, which would address both underlying issues of access to education, housing, population and others, but then also creating tools that would make sense for the state.

She said there must be this plan before creating more avenues because if not, it may feel like the state is “grabbing copies of tools to put in a toolbox that may not necessarily take us into one singular direction.”

When it comes to Hall’s wishes, McMorrow said she aligns with him on the fact that the state cannot “incentivize our way out of our fundamentals,” like building the talent.

McMorrow said brownfield transformation is essential to avoid businesses passing communities by for other land and there is considerable support in her caucus for that.

Rep. Mark Tisdel, R-Rochester Hills, said his view is that if there were to be a new incentive tool, it should be run on a reimbursement schedule rather than upfront funding, wanting to see more accountability on the backend.

Tisdel pointed to boilerplate language in the recent budget as to what to expect out of a new phase of development that pushes for reimbursement instead of grants and the directives for money only being sent to established businesses or organizations, referencing the 2022 legislative grant for Fay Beydoun and her international business accelerator, Global Link International, which was created only a few days before the money was awarded.

Rep. Steve Carra, R-Three Rivers, said the plan after SOAR should be lower taxes across the board and less regulations so all businesses can thrive.

“Government is getting in the way with too much red tape, paperwork, compliance, data mining by the state, guilty until proven innocent type of governance is suppressing business in general,” Carra said. “If we can have a business-friendly environment with lower taxes across the board for everybody it will be setting our state up for success.”

Alongside the sunsetting of SOAR, lawmakers like Sen. Thomas Albert, R-Lowell, have raised the idea of dismantling the Michigan Economic Development Corporation altogether.

When looking at how the changes in SOAR could affect the MEDC, Wegela said there is still need for some of the uses of the corporation outside of government subsidies. He said there needs to be drastic leadership changes inside the corporation, but that there is no need to get rid of it.

The MEDC was formed in 1999 through an interlocal agreement as a successor to economic attraction efforts housed directly within state government.

He said while people like to blame the MEDC for problems in development, the Legislature ultimately gives the corporation “the green light.”

McMorrow said what she hears from her constituents is a call for decentralizing the economic development arm that may not “accurately reflect the needs or strengths of the different regions,” whether that means resizing or spreading out across the state.

She said Michigan is now in the position that Virginia was in a few years ago, in which their lawmakers were upset with their equivalent of the MEDC, that led to “steep reform” and a plan for development like hers.

On the other hand, Tisdel said there isn’t really a purpose for the MEDC, envisioning the reimbursement incentives he wants to see handled by the Department of Treasury, wanting to push against potential political pressure in these grants that he says the MEDC has. Carra wants to fully abolish the MEDC as well, saying getting rid of SOAR is steps in the right direction.

When asked if there is one correct answer to economic development in the state, Carra said “stop doing it.”

“Let the market run its course,” Carra said.

Danielle Emerson, spokesperson for the MEDC, said in a statement to Gongwer News Service that while SOAR was contemplated to sunset, MEDC will be working with the Legislature on “tools and resources to meet this moment in time while continuing to provide support for Michigan’s small businesses, entrepreneurs, local communities, and more the way we always have.”

The MEDC also released a statement after the budget was signed by Whitmer, saying the corporation would continue work on the “Make it in Michigan” economic development strategy.

“We are encouraged that this budget will sustain investment in job creation and grow our tax base by supporting small businesses and communities on both peninsulas, ensuring continued focus on people, places and projects across the state,” MEDC Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer Jr. said in a statement. “This budget provides a path forward for Team Michigan, investing in programs ranging from the arts and tourism and hospitality to supporting dual use aerospace and defense activities. While work remains, these budgetary investments ensure Pure Michigan remains a great place to visit, work, create businesses, and put down roots.”

A cannabis industry group has sued the state over a newly passed wholesale tax on cannabis products as part of a long-term road funding deal, arguing the Legislature and executive branch violated the state Constitution.

In a lawsuit, filed Tuesday afternoon in the Court of Claims the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association contends that the Legislature violated the Constitution by passing a law that amends a voter-initiated law without the necessary three-fourths vote required in both chambers.

The bill, HB 4951, now Public Act 23 of 2025, was signed Tuesday by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer moments before the suit was filed.

The suit is against the Department of Treasury and Treasurer Rachael Eubanks in her capacity as state treasurer.

As passed, PA 23 enacts a 24% wholesale tax on cannabis products in Michigan, a move that was staunchly opposed by industry when it began moving through the Legislature late last month. The tax will be collected beginning Jan. 1, 2026.

Member of the House voted 78-21 for the bill on Sept. 25, five votes shy of a three-quarters majority. The Senate early last Friday morning passed the tax 19-17.

In its suit, the group states that the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act passed by voters in 2018 is the exclusive vehicle for imposing excise taxes on all sales and transfers of marijuana.

“Section 13 of MRTMA provides that “in addition to all other taxes, an excise tax is imposed on each marihuana establishment and on each person who sells marihuana[.]”” the suit states. “The import of this language is clear: while other taxes may generally apply to marihuana, such as the sales tax, MRTMA is the exclusive mechanism for imposing excise taxes. Legislative authority over marihuana excises taxes is exclusive to MRTMA; no other statute may intrude upon or duplicate the marihuana excise tax. Thus, additional excise taxes require a direct amendment to MRTMA itself.”

The Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act created under PA 23 of 2025 by the Legislature without the three-quarters majorities in both chambers is in violation of Article 2, Section 9 of the Michigan Constitution, the lawsuit states.

It was pointed out that many of the definitions and parts of language in the new act were lifted directly from the 2018 voter-initiated law, meaning that Treasury must rely on the 2018 law to implement and enforce the newly passed law.

“Any ambiguity as to which transaction, products, or entities are subject to CRFTA’s excise tax can only be resolved by reference to MRTMA,” the suit states. “It is impossible to construe CRFTA independently without reference to MRTMA. CRFTA is therefore fundamentally dependent on MRTMA.”

The lawsuit also alleges that the new law violates Article 4, Section 24 of the Constitution, which states that no laws can contain more than one subject, nor can a bill be altered by the Legislature to change its original purpose as determined by its content and not alone by its title.

Further, the new law unlawfully amends the 2018 tax law by reference, the suit adds.

The suit seeks a declaratory judgment that PA 23 of 2025 is invalid and unenforceable. The group also seeks an order that the defendants comply with the court’s order and judgement as well as provide for any other relief the court deems proper.

As part of the deal to pass the state’s budget for fiscal year 2025-26 last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee met on Wednesday to discuss a bill that would enshrine transparency measures around budget earmarks, or legislatively directed spending items, in statute.

The committee took up SB 596, which outlines the requirements for earmark transparency, which would require requests to include the name of the requesting legislator, the total amount of the item and estimated cost of the project, the name of the intended recipient or intended location, the expected outcomes and deliverables of the request, a statement attesting there was no conflict of interest, verification of a recipient’s nonprofit status, or a statement that the recipient was not a for-profit entity. Additionally, the bill would require lawmakers to submit their request before the date the budget bill containing it was passed by their chamber for the first time. The bill would allow each chamber to establish other deadlines.

The bill is similar to the earmark transparency passed by the House earlier this year (See Gongwer Michigan Report June 4, 2025).

“The Senate may add more exposure, and the House may have its own spin,” bill sponsor and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Sarah Anthony, said. “Ideally, we would have a shared set of disclosure that we would all make sure are contemplated, and then the flavor the Senate does it versus the House, I think ultimately it’s up to this body.”

The goal, ultimately, Anthony said, is for the public to know how their tax dollars are being spent.

Sen. John Damoose, R-Harbor Springs, said he was eager for this form of transparency in the budget process.

“By and large, I want people to know that I have something in the budget. We’re all trying to prove to our constituents back home that we’re effective for them,” he said.

Damoose went on to say having these measures in place also protected lawmakers from having earmarks put into the budget in their name without their knowledge.

“Now that we have this, we can take credit, basically, for the things we did try to get in there and also have proof of the things we didn’t try to get in,” he said.

The bill also includes requirements for recipients to enter an agreement with the state before receiving the funds, and if they are found not to meet the terms of the agreement, the state would be able to cease payments and cancel the grant if a satisfactory correction plan was not submitted.

“Even when we look at the Fay Beydoun incident, it should not have taken that long to retrieve taxpayer dollars,” Anthony said. “This legislation will help address that in the future.”

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has not reported receiving millions of that grant back to the corporation.

Senators raised questions about the requirement of making grants only for nonprofit or not for profit entities, which Anthony said could be discussed further.

Anthony said she also didn’t want to create a cumbersome process for organizations that are traditionally overlooked in the state budget.

She said she had little interest in taking up some of the other transparency legislation passed by the House, such as the cooling off period for lawmakers before becoming lobbyists. Instead, Anthony said it would be better to pass legislation that would open the House, the Senate and the Governor’s Office up to FOIA requests, and other legislation that would get the public more involved in transparency.

“It would be great if your average Michigander was interested and involved in (the budget) process. I have always been committed to lifting up the voices of men and women across our state, so I’m looking for ways to make the process not just more transparent, but more accessible,” Anthony said. “I would be thrilled if the Speaker started with FOIA reform. When we talk about transparency, shining a light on how decisions are made in this place is something that I think the speaker has supported in the past. It was one of the first things that came out of our Senate majority this year. It all starts with FOIA reform and making sure that we have a process. From there, I think we build upon that.”

Anthony also briefly discussed the path forward for economic development, now that the budget is passed and transparency legislation is moving.

She said that people on both sides of the aisle were tired of incentives that didn’t yield results for taxpayers.

“I hope that we can get to a place that we can have strong tools to make sure that we are competitive on not just a national stage, but a global stage,” she said. “What we don’t need to do is pay corporations and not get much back in return.”",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michigan-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:03:46.508980

As the EPA’s authority expanded through the passage of landmark environmental statutes, criticism of the agency has grown to a point where deregulation has become a recurring rallying cry for industries and conservative politicians who see EPA rules as costly, burdensome and an overreach of federal power.

“We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years.
The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide.
“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said.
Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.","DES MOINES — Iowa biofuels and corn experts congratulated Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but said Wednesday that the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said now that Nebraska has a functioning CO2 pipeline, ethanol plants in the state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a new conference Wednesday. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Trailblazer and 45z

Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.

The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead sequester liquified carbon dioxide. By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the “lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions” of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.

These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican led tax cut law, known as the “one big beautiful bill.”

Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”

Impacts to Iowa

According to IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”

Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.

Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs have also added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.

“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”

Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.

Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.

“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”

Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”

“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.

Harder said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.

Challenges

Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”

“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.

Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.

The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.

Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They have also said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.

Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.

On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restricting law in South Dakota. The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.

Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”

“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_8614-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:55.063334

A Bureau of Land Management webpage providing updates on the progress of Esmeralda Seven Solar—a 6.2 gigawatt (GW) installation in rural Nevada—now states that the endeavor is cancelled, without further context. If built to full spec, the site would’ve been one of the largest power plants in the United States, comparable to the Grand Coulee Dam (about 6.8 GW).

Of course, this should come as no surprise to anyone following the actions of Trump 2.0’s offices. Solar, if you haven’t heard by now, is a big ‘scam’- and it must be a really good one, too, considering so many utilities, states, and hyperscalers continue to fall for it and pursue clean energy projects regardless of federal sentiment and a looming tax incentive rugpull.

If you can think of another use for 62,000 acres of desert wasteland superior to providing clean power to millions of homes and businesses, please enlighten me. And while you’re at it, take any lingering ‘American energy dominance’ rhetoric somewhere else, because I don’t buy it for a second. Those are just words, and the actions of the administration show they have no intention of ‘winning the AI race’ or being dominant in anything other than shooting itself in the foot, repeatedly, at the expense of Americans coast to coast.

“The president doesn’t like windmills” is not even close to being a valid reason to sabotage an entire industry; “The sun doesn’t always shine” is how a six-year-old thinks about solar power.

Clean energy is not just a part of our future- it is the only future, and the longer we wait to catch up to China (and Europe in many respects, quite frankly), the worse off we’ll be for it.

Arevon Starts Up Solar Operations in Indiana

Developer, owner, and operator Arevon Energy announced this week that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts (MWdc) to the grid and are the company’s first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA), and hyperscaler Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

“Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,” said Arevon CEO Kevin Smith. “These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County’s economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana’s future.”

“Pike County is an energy community, and renewable energy sources are a piece of our diversified energy strategy. We are grateful for Arevon’s investment in our area,” added Ashley Willis, MPA, EDFP, Executive Director at the Pike County Economic Development Corporation. “Solar power is a wonderful asset for rural communities, like Pike County, to increase assessed value and has had a positive impact on our tax revenue for our taxing districts.”

Arevon, which owns and operates more than 5.5 gigawatts (GW) of solar and energy storage projects across 17 states, is actively growing its portfolio in the Midwest. Besides Ratts 1 and Heirloom, the company is currently constructing the two-phase 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri, and developed and managed the construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company.

Base Power Raises A Billion Bucks

Typical fundraising announcements on this website rarely include a corresponding dollar value starting with the letter ‘B,’ but that should tell you how hot energy storage is right now.

Texas-based distributed storage pioneer Base Power announced Wednesday that it has raised $1 billion in Series C financing, led by Addition. All other major investors in the round are re-investing, including: Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New major investors include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” stated Zach Dell, CEO and co-founder of Base Power. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

In less than two years, Base Power has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the country. The company has also partnered with homebuilder Lennar and several utilities on virtual power plants, recently qualifying for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the grid.

Base Power is building its first energy storage and power electronics factory at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press in the heart of downtown Austin.

Doral Finds Offtaker for Cold Creek Solar

Utility-scale developer and independent power producer Doral Renewables has executed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a corporate buyer for its 430 MWac Cold Creek Solar Project located in Schleicher and Tom Green Counties, Texas. The Agreement covers 75% of the facility’s energy output and 100% of the associated Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). The Cold Creek Solar project is expected to deliver over 1 million MWh annually.

Cold Creek Solar is expected to deliver over 1 million MWh annually. The project will boost local infrastructure and community impact initiatives, such as road improvements and emergency responders, as part of its community engagement. The project also supported a local non-profit during a recent summer flooding emergency.

“Our ability to work with top companies and utilities is a testament to our business plan and commitment to new renewable energy projects across the United States,” said Sean Boyle, Vice President, Markets of Doral Renewables. “This new relationship is a substantial accomplishment and a foundational agreement as Doral continues to expand its operating portfolio across the country”.

The transaction increases the company’s contracted energy generation to more than 1.6 GW in total.

Nexamp Scores $330 Million Construction Warehouse Facility

Distributed solar and storage solutions company Nexamp announced the closing of a three-year, $330 million Construction Warehouse Facility (CWF) with a consortium of leading financial institutions. The financing will enable Nexamp to develop, construct, and finance a revolving portfolio of approximately 20 new distributed generation assets, advancing the company’s mission to address increased energy demand with reliable, affordable domestic resources.

The CWF provides flexible construction capital to support Nexamp’s near-term pipeline of solar and energy storage projects. Once completed, these assets are expected to transition into long-term financing structures, including tax equity funding or refinancing, ensuring sustainable growth and deployment of renewable energy infrastructure nationwide.

MUFG committed $200 million as the largest lender in the facility, also serving as Mandated Lead Arranger and Administrative Agent. ING followed with a $100 million allocation and additional responsibilities as Mandated Lead Arranger, Lender, Hedge Provider, and Green Loan Structuring Agent. Siemens Financial Services contributed $30 million as Joint Lead Arranger. U.S. Bank National Association acted as Collateral Agent.

Zaid Ashai, CEO of Nexamp, said the transaction marks a pivotal moment in the company’s expansion.

“By securing flexible construction capital, we are better positioned to deliver the clean energy projects that communities across the country urgently need as demand rises. Solar continues to be the most cost-effective and easy-to-deploy source of new electricity, outpacing all other sources by a wide margin already this year,” Ashai explained.

Nightpeak Fires up 150 MW Texas Battery

Do-it-all developer and operator Nightpeak Energy announced last Friday that Bocanova Power, a 150 MW, 2-hour duration battery storage project located in Brazoria County, Texas, is now operating. Located 24 miles south of downtown Houston, Bocanova Power reached commercial operation in August 2025 and is now providing quick responding, flexible power to support the Houston region’s peak capacity needs.

Bocanova Power utilizes Tesla’s Megapack 2 XL battery storage systems manufactured in Lathrop, California. The facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment-grade power purchaser, unnamed by the company. Nord/LB and MUFG Bank served as co-lead arrangers on the debt financing, which included a tax equity bridge loan, construction to term loan, and letters of credit. Traditional tax equity partnership financing was also utilized for this transaction.

“We submitted an interconnection request for Bocanova Power in mid-2023 and just two years later, this 150 MW project is providing flexible, dispatchable capacity to the Texas grid. Bocanova Power demonstrates the speed at which Nightpeak Energy is overcoming complex challenges to energize projects that support America’s growing need for affordable, reliable, and secure energy,” noted Paris Hays, co-founder and CEO/CDO of Nightpeak Energy.

Nightpeak says its focus is on developing projects in the Western United States and Texas specifically, where the rapid growth of intermittent renewable energy resources has created a significant need for flexible, dispatchable generation assets.

NineDot Lands $175 Million Debt Facility

Northeast community-scale battery energy storage systems developer Ninedot has completed a $175 million revolving debt financing from Deutsche Bank.

The company will use the financing to support activities across its development timeline, from grid interconnection deposits to equipment procurement and project construction. NineDot supports a vision for broad, distributed energy storage throughout New York City, in alignment with New York State’s goal of having 6000 megawatts of battery storage in operation by 2030. The facility also enabled NineDot to pay back its existing revolver for funding grid interconnection deposits with NY Green Bank.

“NineDot’s mission is to create innovative urban energy solutions for a cleaner and more sustainable future, and battery storage is a key part of that for New York City,” said David Arfin, NineDot Energy CEO and co-founder. “With seven projects operating during this past hot summer, we’ve proven that we can deliver safe and reliable energy solutions in a dense urban area. Our next step is to accelerate our growth and scale our business, and Deutsche Bank recognized the importance of and opportunity in our approach.”

NineDot Energy currently has seven operating projects across four locations in The Bronx and Staten Island. These projects recently supported approximately 26,000 New York City households on hot summer days. With more than 60 additional projects in some phase of development or construction, NineDot remains on target to achieve its goal of having 400 MW in development, construction, or operation by the end of 2026.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FT-Template-31-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:50.300862

Maybe that’s the lesson Wyatt left us with: Who cares if you get shot down three times?","I’m sure there are a lot of folks who will only attend Oscar Wyatt’s funeral to make sure he’s dead. The Houston oilman, who died Wednesday at age 101, made plenty of enemies.

In the seventies, the questionable business practices of his company, Coastal States Gas, stuck the people of San Antonio with sky-high bills. In the eighties, he convinced one of his stepsons to sue his uncle, a.k.a. Wyatt’s brother-in-law, Robert Sakowitz, when he thought the latter was mismanaging the family department store chain. In the nineties, he paid kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s government, in violation of United Nations sanctions. (For that he was convicted, at age 83, and spent nine months in federal prison.)

Married four times, Wyatt was considered—to put it politely—a swordsman. “Oscar is the only man I know that has a mattress strapped to his back for convenience,” his first wife told Texas Monthly’s Jan Jarboe Russell.

But he was also shrewd, charming, hilarious, and fearless. He worked with his BFF, former Texas Governor John Connally, to convince Saddam Hussein to release American hostages—after Wyatt had warned George H. W. Bush, whom he did not particularly like, not to go to war with Iraq over Kuwait in the first place.

I’m sure there were many other good deeds that would make Wyatt’s bad deeds pale in comparison—he was very sentimental—but there’s really no point in trying to be binary about him. Wyatt was sui generis. Love him or hate him, we may never see the likes of him again—he was an exemplar of the brash, wily, hell-for-leather Texan. J. R. Ewing was a cheap imitation.

Born in Beaumont, he was shaped by a fatherless, poverty-ridden childhood in Navasota. After serving as a bomber pilot during World War II and graduating from Texas A&M with a mechanical engineering degree, he sold drill bits in the oil fields. He founded his first oil company with an $800 loan and by 1955 had started Coastal. Over the subsequent decades, he did whatever he had to do to acquire millions upon millions, and eventually billions.

His fourth marriage was to Lynn Wyatt (neé Sakowitz), whose name was rarely free of the modifier “international socialite.” So, along with all the Middle Eastern strongmen and U.S. politicians that Wyatt could reach with one phone call, Oscar found himself in the company of Princess Grace, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Karl Lagerfeld, Andy Warhol, Liza Minelli, Rudolph Nureyev, Truman Capote, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and the Reagans (whom he wasn’t particularly fond of either).

Reading about Wyatt’s constant socializing and deal cutting, I sometimes wondered whether he ever wished he could just stay at home and watch a football game while popping a cold one and snacking on pretzel sticks. But that wasn’t his thing. He nurtured, pruned, and shaped his spectacular life in a way most people couldn’t even begin to imagine. Who puts his own plane into a dive while proposing marriage to scare his lover into saying yes? Who shoots feral hogs from a helicopter at his South Texas ranch to entertain (or shock) his wife’s hoity-toity guests?

Later, after serving his prison time, suffering a stroke, and hitting his nineties, Wyatt was much diminished. Wheelchair-bound, he was unable to speak anywhere close to as fast as he could think. His once bright eyes grew vacant.

Yet he seemed to enjoy his ninety-seventh birthday celebration, in 2021, when he was inducted into the Texas Aviation Hall of Fame at a fancy-pants party at the Lone Star Flight Museum. Old friends, many white-haired and memorable from the heady oil-boom days of the seventies, patted his shoulder and gave him hugs. A B-25, the type of plane he had flown, was prominently displayed. Wyatt wept when his sons paid him tribute, and he squeezed a friend’s hand three times to indicate how many times he had been shot down.

If Oscar Wyatt wasn’t exactly a hero, maybe he was something more important. He was the last real deal, the cunning rogue who provided living proof that our state’s mythology wasn’t just a lot of hot air.

Des Moines – The Iowa Environmental Council (IEC), Environmental Law & Policy Center (ELPC), and Food & Water Watch have sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) challenging the agency’s action to rescind its partial disapproval of Iowa’s 2024 Impaired Waters list under Clean Water Act section 303(d).

EPA issued that partial disapproval on December 30, 2024, listing seven water segments in the state as impaired due to nitrate levels. IEC and ELPC commented in support of the proposed additions to the 2024 impaired waters list in order to limit nitrate contamination in drinking water sources. Drinking nitrate-contaminated water is linked to a host of negative health outcomes including birth defects and cancers.

On July 11, 2025, EPA took the highly unusual step of rescinding its partial disapproval, claiming that it was removing the newly listed impaired segments because it was “appropriate to allow EPA to evaluate additional information.” This unprecedented action means that major rivers in Iowa are not treated as exceeding the nitrate standard for purposes of the Clean Water Act. (Read more about the timeline, the Impaired Waters List, and nitrate impairments here.)

The public only discovered EPA’s action weeks after its decision. EPA and DNR did not provide notice to the public or opportunity for input.

“EPA’s action undermines the public process defined in federal regulations and limits public transparency,” said Michael Schmidt, General Counsel for IEC. “No law says that EPA can change its mind after it made a final decision the way it did in this case, especially when it is weakening protections for the public. The path to this decision lacks transparency and is based on outdated and incomplete information.”

EPA rescinded its December listing of the waters after DNR explained its position in a phone call and provided additional information. IEC submitted a records request that showed the only written communication was an email sending decades-old documents that had already been submitted to EPA, along with EPA’s own decades-old approval letter. The DNR email did not include the DNR position cited in EPA’s letter.

“EPA rolling back water quality protections based on ‘back room’ conversations is not how agencies should operate,” said Josh Mandelbaum, Senior Attorney at ELPC. “While Iowa is in the midst of ongoing and serious water quality problems, there is no justification for EPA to flip-flop because of old documents it already had, especially its own letter from 2002.”

Food & Water Watch Staff Attorney Dani Replogle said:

“The data is clearer than ever that Iowa waterways are overwhelmed with persistent, toxic nitrate contamination. Iowans need more clean water protections — not less. EPA’s baseless decision to turn its back on central Iowa’s water crisis without even providing an opportunity for public input does not inspire confidence in the federal agency meant to safeguard clean water and protect our health. Iowans demand and deserve better.”

The environmental groups’ letter highlights that the new direction will increase regulatory costs for downstream water users, including Iowa’s most populous metropolitan areas. DNR and EPA seek to treat the drinking water standard for nitrate as a long-term, chronic standard – despite the short-term effects such as blue baby syndrome.

“While this path may seem complex, the issue is simple: EPA is not doing the important work of protecting public health. Claiming that our waterways meet drinking water standards when EPA has found those same nitrate levels could cause blue baby syndrome is unjustified and dangerous,” said Colleen Fowle, Water Program Director for IEC. “Removing the impairment at the same time Central Iowa had to implement unprecedented water use restrictions made no sense. EPA’s action fails to put the onus on the polluters to adopt practices that will actually fix the problem.”

The letter sent by the environmental groups states that because EPA has reopened the process to consider additional information, it should consider public input. The letter includes additional information about the application of the drinking water standard on a short-term basis. The groups explain that the documents adopting the water quality standard for drinking water do not justify treating nitrate as a chronic pollutant.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/press_header_cleanwater_8.png,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:24.630182

The Crisafulli Government has unveiled its Energy Roadmap to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for Queenslanders.
The Roadmap includes: $400 million Queensland Energy Investment Fund and Queensland Investment Corporation’s new Investor Gateway to drive private sector investment in new energy generation and firming projects.
$1.6 billion Electricity Maintenance Guarantee to improve our current energy assets.
Treasurer and Minister for Energy David Janetzki said the Energy Roadmap was based on economics and engineering, not ideology.","The Crisafulli Government's Energy Roadmap delivered to improve Queensland’s energy assets while building what is needed for the future.

$26 billion in reduced energy system costs to 2035 compared to the previous Labor Government’s early closure plan.

The Energy Roadmap provides clarity for the future of coal and gas, and support for private sector investment in renewables and firming projects.

The Crisafulli Government has unveiled its Energy Roadmap to deliver affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for Queenslanders.

By improving Queensland’s existing energy assets while building what is needed for the future, the Crisafulli Government is putting downward pressure on energy prices, optimising investment to respect taxpayer money and boosting private sector investment in new generation.

The Roadmap presents a sensible and pragmatic plan to meet Queensland’s energy needs, contrasting with the undeliverable timeframes, poorly scoped projects and tens of billions of dollars in cost blowouts under Labor’s implausible Energy and Jobs Plan.

It also reduces energy system costs for taxpayers by $26 billion to 2035, preventing the average Queensland household paying an extra $1035 a year that they would have paid under Labor.

The Roadmap includes:

$400 million Queensland Energy Investment Fund and Queensland Investment Corporation’s new Investor Gateway to drive private sector investment in new energy generation and firming projects.

$1.6 billion Electricity Maintenance Guarantee to improve our current energy assets.

Clear decision-making framework for the operation of state-owned coal assets, balancing system needs, asset integrity, and economic viability.

A tender for 400MW of new gas-fired generation in Central Queensland.

Consolidated management of future pumped hydro proposals by QIC to provide a consistent approach to assessment and investment.

New $10 million investment into community level batteries for greater solar storage and to help manage minimum system load.

Construction of the Eastern Link of the CopperString transmission line in North Queensland and beginning of work on the Western Link.

Establishment of Regional Energy Hubs to put downward pressure on development costs.

Development of a new code of conduct for renewable energy developers to guide responsible behaviour and set community expectations.

Treasurer and Minister for Energy David Janetzki said the Energy Roadmap was based on economics and engineering, not ideology.

“Our Energy Roadmap delivers what Queenslanders need, which is affordable and reliable energy that enhances their quality of life, fuels economic growth, and ensures long-term sustainability, all while ensuring our state is an attractive destination for private sector capital and creating jobs,” Mr Janetzki said.

“Labor’s energy plan lacked credibility, was undeliverable and would have resulted in Queensland households paying thousands more on top of their energy bills.”

Underpinned by robust electricity system modelling and extensive consultation with investors, industry, and stakeholders, the Energy Roadmap highlights the importance of leveraging existing assets to keep energy prices low while planning for the future.

“The former Labor Government’s ideological decision to close coal units by 2035, regardless of their condition, is officially abolished,” Mr Janetzki said.

“Queensland’s coal-fired fleet is the youngest in the country and state-owned coal generators will continue to operate for as long as they are needed in the system and supported by the market.

“This is an economic solution that places downward pressure on prices for households, businesses, and industry, while ensuring developers have the confidence to plan for the future.

""We’re laying the groundwork for private capital to flow into new energy infrastructure, unlocking economic growth and ensuring Queensland remains competitive in an evolving energy market.”

Chair, Senate Environmental Quality Committee

1021 O Street, Room 3230

Sacramento, CA 95814

RE: Support for AB 30 (Alvarez) State Air Resources Board: gasoline specifications: ethanol blends

Dear Chair Blakespear,

On behalf of Growth Energy, I write in support of AB 30 (Alvarez) which would make transportation fuel blends of up to 15% ethanol (E15) legal for sale and use in California. Growth Energy is the world’s largest trade association representing 97 U.S. biorefineries that

produce more than nine billion gallons of cleaner-burning, renewable fuel annually. Our members account for more than half of the bioethanol produced in the United States each year. Together, we are working to bring consumers better and more affordable choices at the fuel pump, improve air quality, and protect the environment for future generations. We remain committed to helping diversify our country’s energy portfolio, grow more energy jobs, decarbonize our nation’s energy mix, sustain family farms, and drive down the costs of transportation fuels for consumers.

AB 30 will significantly reduce light-duty fuel costs for California’s consumers. A recent study by the University of California, Berkeley and the United States Naval Academy indicates that California drivers could save as much as 20 cents per gallon with the inclusion of E15 in the fuel supply. The same study indicates California drivers could save as much as $2.7 billion annually at the pump if E15 replaced E10.

Furthermore, E15 reduces fuel emissions and has notable environmental benefits. Testing by the University of California, Riverside shows E15 significantly reduces tailpipe emissions compared to E10. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gases and harmful

particulates that contribute to air pollution.

E15 is well tested and has already been used across the country. After extensively testing the fuel in 86 vehicles for a total of six million miles, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved E15 in 2011 for all passenger vehicles model year 2001 and newer. Since

its approval, E15 has efficiently fueled 150 billion miles driven in the United States. E15 is available for sale in 34 states at more than 4,200 fuel retail locations. It is time for California to approve the sale and use of E15, just as every other state in the nation has done.

For the reasons outlined above, Growth Energy is pleased to support AB 30 and urge an AYE vote on this critical measure. We look forward to continued collaboration with your office and other policymakers to implement E15, reduce air emissions, and make fuel more affordable for Californians.

Sincerely,

A month before that, the manufacturer and energy department agreed to cancel a separate $164 million federal grant related to the project.
During his weekly Team Kentucky update, he said his office hadn’t gotten official word regarding the possibility of funding cuts.
“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy.” Most of the cuts this month yanked funding from Democratic states.
The new, longer list includes grant projects in Republican states, too.","Kentucky’s energy projects could lose about $460 million in federal grants as the Trump administration considers more funding cuts.

An electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility and several energy-related research projects are on the funding chopping block, according to a list of potential cuts first reported by Semafor and now circulating around Capitol Hill.

The list is about a dozen pages long and includes hundreds of project grants totaling about $24 billion.

A $316 million grant for a Hopkinsville electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility being built by Ascend Elements is targeted on the list, and the company said it was notified Oct. 7 it had been terminated. The Massachusetts-based manufacturer announced in October 2022 plans to invest close to $1 billion to build its largest EV battery recycling and manufacturing facility in Christian County, creating 400 full-time jobs.

Ascend Elements CEO Linh Austin said in an email to the Herald-Leader any DOE decision regarding grants doesn’t change the company’s trajectory.

“We will replace the terminated grant with a balanced mix of private growth, equity, project finance, strategic offtake pre-payments, and non-U.S. incentives, including support we’ve been awarded in the EU,” Austin said. “Our business economics are not predicated on grants, but by Consumer Demand, Operational Excellence and our patented Hydro-to-Cathode technology.”

In April, Kentucky Public Radio reported construction had been paused on part of the facility , though it’s set to restart next year.

Also in April, Ascend Elements was named a defendant in a lawsuit over $138 million in unpaid construction bills. A month before that, the manufacturer and energy department agreed to cancel a separate $164 million federal grant related to the project.

Also targeted on the list is a $75 million grant for Diageo, the alcoholic beverage company, which planned to add batteries to its facility in Shelbyville to reduce carbon emissions.

That grant was terminated in May, as was the $72 million one for a carbon capture project at LG&E and KU’s Cane Run Generating Station just outside Louisville. It also appears on the longer list.

The $50 million grant supporting Mitsubishi Electric Corporation as it retrofits a Maysville factory to make high-efficiency heat pumps could also have its funding cut, according to the list.

Five projects through the University of Kentucky Research Foundation are on the list and could stand to lose almost $24 million altogether.

The largest of those grants, almost $7 million, is for a Pigman College of Engineering and Institute for Decarbonization and Energy Advancement project demonstrating the effectiveness of a carbon capture device that then puts the raw material into glass production, according to grant award documents.

The UK Research Foundation and a university spokesperson were not immediately available for comment.

Kentucky has been the recipient of several recent high-dollar economic development announcements related to clean energy. It has seemingly embraced multiple parts of the EV supply chain through incentives from the legislature and tax credits for consumers passed under Former President Joe Biden.

Gov. Andy Beshear is no stranger to securing frozen or canceled federal funds. Just this year, he’s joined multistate lawsuits to restore funding for AmeriCorps, K-12 schools and public health programs.

During his weekly Team Kentucky update, he said his office hadn’t gotten official word regarding the possibility of funding cuts.

“I’d be very disappointed if this is gonna move forward,” he said.

In a statement, Department of Energy Deputy Press Secretary Emery Washington said the department’s staff “have been unable to verify the lists we’ve seen so far.”

In an emailed statement to the Herald-Leader, the department’s chief spokesperson, Ben Dietderich, said no additional determinations have been made about funding aside from cuts already announced this year.

At the start of October, the Department of Energy terminated 321 financial packages totaling $7.56 billion for 223 projects, several of which are on the long list, according to E&E News. About two dozen other grants canceled earlier in the year also appear on the list.

“As Secretary (Chris) Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Dietderich said.

The cuts so far this year, and the new list indicating more might be coming, match President Donald Trump’s agenda to cancel clean energy programs. Trump has often criticized renewable energy, especially the effort to reduce carbon emissions, as part of a “green energy scam.”

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Wright said in a statement when the department made its Oct. 2 cuts. “President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy.”

Most of the cuts this month yanked funding from Democratic states. Members of Congress in those states said in a letter to the department secretary that the decision was blatantly partisan and would harm jobs, weaken the grid and give foreign adversaries like China an edge.

The new, longer list includes grant projects in Republican states, too.

It also shows more billions of dollars could be cut for five hydrogen hubs authorized by Biden’s energy department and his infrastructure bill that allocated funding to the system that would have produced and transported clean energy across the country.

ARCH2, headquartered in West Virginia, is one of those hubs. It would have regional activity and support jobs in Kentucky, but it isn’t estimated to be in service until 2027 or 2028, according to the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub, or ARCH2.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/xrynpf/picture312445365/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/LEX_02_241205WindTurbine_rh.JPG,N,,2025-10-10 12:07:32.961093

Green industrial policy requires a range of expertise and insights.
For the past decade, a growing body of academic work has identified conditions for success in green industrial policy.
To ensure popular buy-in and support, green industrial policy needs to show that it can deliver.","The European Commission is seeking input to update its 2023 Economic Security Strategy amid global trade turbulence and ongoing negotiations arising from the EU-US tariff and trade accord reached in July. Climate change is expected to be less of a priority given the current economic, security, and geopolitical environment, and this is likely to impact green technology firms that develop and manufacture the equipment and services required to produce, install, and manage effective and efficient renewable energy provision. The EU’s green industrial policy must adapt accordingly if the bloc’s policymakers wish to reach their official competitiveness, economic security, and decarbonization goals without sacrificing one for the others. This brief assesses the EU’s green industrial policy, examines the obstacles to decarbonization posed by increasing security challenges, and proposes recommendations to ensure that targeted investments and policies to promote clean technologies in Europe are fit for purpose.

The Return of Industrial Policy

The tripartite challenge of decarbonization, competitiveness, and economic security, sometimes but not always explicitly related to countering China, was central to US policymaking under the Biden administration. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 was itself in part a delayed reaction to Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial strategy and the Chinese state’s enormous support for scaling the production of green tech equipment. Europe’s primary concerns about the IRA were related to its use of local content requirements and the risk that EU firms would leave the bloc’s territory en masse to benefit from the United States’ cheap fossil energy and its green tech subsidies. These worries were not entirely borne out, as the immediate empirical effects of the IRA on the EU and trade and investment flows did not match initial warnings. Still, the legacy of the EU’s response to the Biden administration’s “post-neoliberal” turn to industrial policy remains salient for Europe. The IRA provoked a sense that something more needed to be done to keep up with US (and, increasingly, Chinese) intervention to support strategic green technologies. The legacy of this reaction, coinciding with rising security concerns, presents unresolved challenges for Europe today. Can decarbonization, competitiveness, and an economy fit for new security challenges be achieved together? Are these goals interlinked? Is countering China, for example, an inherent condition for achieving decarbonization? Or does Europe face a trilemma requiring difficult trade-offs?

The Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA), followed by the recent Competitiveness Compass and Clean Industrial Deal, represent the EU’s ongoing attempts to balance competitiveness, security, and decarbonization. But key points remain unclear. The NZIA aims to have 40% of clean tech manufactured in the EU by 2030. But it falls short in addressing how to achieve that goal and specifying the needed funding options in relevant sectors. In addition, intra-European disagreements over the EU’s response to the IRA linger. They include how and whether to maintain World Trade Organization compliance, Europe’s relative ability to match US or Chinese subsidies, and the limits beyond which loosening state aid rules to promote green tech manufacturing would damage the single market. Member states with larger fiscal capacity, such as France and Germany, argue for more subsidies to promote domestic manufacturing of green tech equipment through mechanisms including the 2023 Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework and measures approved under its mandate (e.g., a €10.82 billion French offshore wind scheme). But there are now signs that smaller states such as the Nordics, Belgium, and the Netherlands, usually reticent about carve-outs to the official EU prohibition on state aid, are shifting their traditional positions. Differences of opinion also persist among members states over the need to decarbonize by just importing the cheapest green technology as rapidly as possible, even if it negatively impacts the EU’s own clean tech capabilities or security.

Implementation of these European green industrial policies now faces additional headwinds. First, the days when the IRA seemed like the biggest threat are gone. The Trump administration has terminated the act’s tax credits for wind and solar technology, cancelled clean energy project grants, rolled back Environmental Protection Agency enforcement, and targeted state-level environmental policymaking through a wide-reaching executive order. EU firms such as Denmark’s Ørsted are reeling from a stop-work order on its $6.2 billion Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, showing the knock-on effects of Washington’s actions on European economies. Unlike the United States, Europe is dependent on external energy suppliers, leading to higher structural energy costs and a less competitive manufacturing sector. EU wholesale gas prices in 2024 were five times higher than those in the United States, and wholesale electricity prices also remain higher despite regional disparities. Second, losing market share or increasing dependencies in key clean technologies is its own type of security threat, with EU industry already impacted by Beijing’s dominance of green tech and electric vehicles amid worries about a new China shock. With the Trump administration having withdrawn from international agreements such as the Paris Accords, prohibiting scientists employed by the federal government from attending Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meetings, and clashing with EU officials over the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) climate agenda, Europe is adapting its role in international climate diplomacy to fill the vacuum left by the United States, including in international development banks. Third, defense spending has become the priority in the halls of Brussels and European capitals as the United States scales back global involvement and Russia continues its aggressive stance. A green industrial strategy that allows the EU to meet its stated economic, security, and climate targets must adapt to this broader global context.

Obstacles to European Decarbonization

Beyond the aforementioned systemic factors, achieving climate targets through green industrial policy faces several other important and overlapping hurdles.

Clean tech is a communications and marketing challenge. The EU needs a compelling narrative around green industrial policy to ensure buy-in and support by providing concrete examples of the benefits of a greener economy for EU citizens. As the Draghi report on EU competitiveness noted, targeted investments that further the most important comparative advantages and strategic interests will have the greatest chance of success. But citizens must be told why difficult decisions are needed using a positive narrative that reflects the trade-offs and synergies between rising defense spending and sustained investment in green technologies. As studies by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund show, green investments are positively correlated with national security, energy independence, and long-term economic resilience.

Lack of demand is a barrier to clean tech uptake and deployment. Even if Europe were able to produce all the wind turbines, solar panels, and other green tech equipment it needs, barriers to the use of that equipment weaken demand for it. The barriers include delayed permitting processes, lack of market integration, and limited purchasing power, including lack of demand for green energy and infrastructure. The NZIA addresses the need to harmonize permitting processes across member state legal structures, but significant amounts of planned capacity remain frozen. In the case of wind energy, for example, an average of 81% of planned EU investment in new wind capacity is stuck in permitting stages. In Portugal, it is 45%, but it is 100% in several other member states. Demand-side support through policies such as guarantees, sustainability standards, or public procurement mandates can strengthen demand for clean technologies over the longer term. The OECD has compiled examples of obstacles, tools, and methodologies for green public procurement across EU member states, and granular data can facilitate targeting policies to sectoral and regional needs.

The EU’s infrastructure is still insufficient to meet the needs of the green transition. The transition requires resilient energy systems. Power grid preparedness and interconnection are foundational aspects of improving the EU’s energy independence and ensuring that new installations can be brought online. 5G and deployment of energy-efficient smart systems can optimize energy use. The April 2025 blackout on the Iberian Peninsula illustrates the importance of modernizing grid infrastructure for new demand and integrating renewable energy sources. Improving vehicle-charging infrastructure is another key aspect of a successful green transition.

The financing environment for green tech investment is inadequate for achieving scale. Research and development, innovation, and commercialization of green technologies depend on a dynamic investment environment and more unified capital markets. But the EU is hampered by saving and investment habits that lead to a largely bank-centered system, persistent division along national lines, and small and fractured capital markets and venture ecosystems. This poses challenges for scaling Europe’s green tech industry, its longevity, and targeting production assistance. According to the European Investment Bank, annual venture capital investments are approximately six times higher in the United States than in the EU. The key challenge to competing with Chinese state support lies in achieving scale across supply chains. The recent bankruptcy of battery startup Northvolt illustrates the challenges of achieving scale despite significant investment. The firm struggled with supply chain administration; prolonged dependency on Chinese and Korean equipment makers, which led to workplace tensions; and had difficulty attracting skilled workers in remote northern Sweden, which meant that the company’s primary plant was producing below 1% of its theoretical capacity.

Clean tech requires new skills, and labor markets must adapt. A robust clean-tech manufacturing ecosystem could be a boon for European economies, but it requires skills training and constant reevaluation as technologies quickly develop. The installation sector in particular is critical for green tech employment and skills development in many geographic regions and throughout the industry. Addressing these issues is mainly a member-state responsibility, which means results have so far varied. A comprehensive mapping of 26 national skills strategies by the OECD, including for the green transition, produced nine key lessons for success, among them the importance of aligning skills policies with other government strategies and ensuring constant feedback among government, industry, and social partners.

Recommendations

As the EU prepares to update its economic security strategy, moving from risk identification to risk mitigation in a world of geopolitical and trade tensions, green industrial policy must adapt. The Commission and member states can readjust their policy approach to align competitiveness, innovation, decarbonization, and economic security goals by prioritizing the following:

1. Good data for good policy

a. Clean tech and security mapping can identify strategic areas at a granular level. Following the Draghi report’s push for strategic focus on certain key areas, the EU’s Directorate-General for Climate Action (DG GLIMA) and Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) should use their shared ownership of the Clean Industrial Deal to identify key choke points and strategic assets across clean tech value chains. This can build on broader frameworks, such as those developed by the IEA, but tailored for the EU and specific security challenges. For example, solar panel production is dominated by China, but European industry is and can remain the lead supplier of many electrical and electronic components integral to solar energy production systems. Such a mapping exercise will be crucial to inform targeted policy interventions at the EU and member-state levels.

b. Green industrial policy requires a range of expertise and insights. Ad hoc knowledge exchange among experts and European Commission and European Parliament policymakers should shift to regular exchanges and briefings, with an emphasis on gathering insights from as wide a range of experts as possible, including industry and national-level experts and regulators close to the issue. For the past decade, a growing body of academic work has identified conditions for success in green industrial policy. Economist Dani Rodrik wrote in 2014 about the key principles of embeddedness (cooperation and iteration between public and private without capturing the process), discipline (carrots and sticks), and accountability. Other recent work has emphasized the firm-specific nature of industrial policy, showing the importance of targeting policy approaches to loans, grants, guarantees, tariffs, and other tools. Checking ongoing initiatives such as new subsidy regimes against the benchmarks laid out in this type of research will ensure that policy is dynamic and responsive to changing circumstances. The European Parliament Research Service’s “What Think Tanks are thinking” reports could be adopted as a model for broader, more frequent updates for policymakers.

2. Targeted international engagement for domestic success

a. Engage with non-EU economies to prioritize scale. An EU green industrial policy should aim at competing for market share within the bloc and in external markets, and at increasing scale to bring down marginal costs. The EU launched negotiations for the first of its new Clean Trade and Investment Partnerships (CTIP) with South Africa in March 2025. These “mini trade deals” could help identify interests within particular markets or governments and adapt instruments to support industries or goals. But for CTIPs to succeed, partner countries will need more concrete guidance about benefits and how this initiative promises to complement existing programs such as Global Gateway. Lessons should also be drawn from Ukraine on grid resilience, the need to build back cleaner energy infrastructure, Russian obstruction, and US ownership or trusteeship of pivotal infrastructure including gas storage. Recognition of Ukraine as a source of critical minerals for the country’s and the EU’s clean tech industries is also needed.

b. Do not give up on targeted transatlantic industrial policy coordination. EU and US companies are strong leaders in green tech development and have deep investments in production on both sides of the Atlantic. Reflecting this, the Trade and Technology Council produced initiatives and policy recommendations to promote transatlantic green industry development, including through its Working Group Two on Climate and Clean Tech and its Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade. Such close coordination on climate-focused industrial policy is unlikely with the Trump administration, but the EU can and should build on existing industry ties. Even on the government level, deals can be made by focusing on mutual interests and geopolitical considerations. The EU and the United States, for example, still share a common interest in diversifying supply chains for critical minerals and rare earths. Battery supply chains could be an area in which necessity forces cooperation. Work on mapping and accounting for Chinese subsidies across clean tech production could be of mutual interest. Jointly funded research initiatives to identify and close gaps could be easily achieved when broader political agreements remain out of reach.

3. Everything is PR: Improve the politics of industrial policy. To ensure popular buy-in and support, green industrial policy needs to show that it can deliver. The narrative and public perception of investing in clean tech is just as important as the nitty-gritty of policy details. Eurobarometer surveys show security and defense is the top medium-term priority for EU citizens, with migration, economic competitiveness, and climate close behind. A winning political narrative will not frame these as inherent trade-offs but emphasize the mutually reinforcing benefits of green industrial policy, such as stronger local communities and job opportunities, knowledge spillover and upskilling, the benefits of scale for cost effectiveness, and the dangers of dependency in a world of rising tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Focus groups and surveys developing political messaging should explicitly test this framing. Participants could be asked, for example, if the Iberian blackout makes grid capacity a higher priority issue and how citizens link this challenge to integrating renewables into energy networks.

A tripartite ambition of strengthening competitiveness, bolstering strategic readiness, and pursuing decarbonization does not need to be a zero-sum endeavor. A green industrial strategy that is fit for purpose can help Europe achieve these interdependent strategic goals.",https://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/styles/watermark/public/2025-10/shutterstock_2402908895_0.jpg?itok=qmnuzR7n,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:00.969954

From plant to plant, the list of variables any leadership team may have to navigate when working to bring a CCS project to bear can seem never-ending and nuanced—even the smallest differences can create big challenges. Above-ground geography and below-ground geology both matter, but for different reasons. CO2 infrastructure experts and technology providers are important, so too are carbon-focused end-users. Internal team buy-in is crucial, almost as much as the support of external stakeholders.

The road to fully integrated CCS or carbon neutrality is—and has been—different from plant to plant for producers not linked to a multi-state pipeline solution. Those that have made progress to date have taken a multifaceted approach. Some are further along than others, sometimes based on their location.

Ethanol Producer Magazine checked in with several ethanol producers across the country on progress in planning, permitting and their respective carbon-intensity reduction plans. Support for individual, plant-specific CCS has sprouted and spread—despite its challenges—from the Corn Belt to the West Coast.

Conestoga’s Net-Zero Goal

Conestoga Energy CEO Tom Willis says his team in Kansas was all about carbon before carbon was ever cool. According to Willis, Conestoga was the first to take low-carbon fuel to California under the LCFS back in 2010. Through two Kansas plants, Conestoga produces roughly 200 million gallons of ethanol per year: 115 MMgy at the Arkalon facility near Liberal and 62 MMgy at the Bonanza plant in Garden City.

The Arkalon facility has been capturing CO2 for roughly 15 years as part of an enhanced oil recovery CO2 injection program operated by CapturePoint LLC throughout parts of Kansas and Oklahoma.

“We looked at carbon and said we could expand and grow,” Willis says of his team’s early adoption of a carbon-focused strategy. Today, Conestoga refers to itself as a low-carbon solutions provider, not just an ethanol producer.

“We are trying to become net zero,” Willis says.

To do that, Conestoga has expanded its CCS efforts to both plants. In May, the company announced drilling was complete on its first Class VI CCS well near its Garden City plant. Willis called the well the “cornerstone of Conestoga’s initiative to permanently store carbon dioxide emissions generated during the ethanol production process.”

The CCS project will be a long-term staple of Conestoga’s net-zero vision, Willis says, but the company will continue to explore ways to lower its CI score and maintain a strong connection to markets in need of carbon solutions, both domestic and foreign.

After completing work on the Class VI well, several interested parties from fertilizer manufacturers to warehouse owners have reached out to Conestoga regarding carbon-sequestration possibilities. “They are coming to us,” Willis says. “We don’t have to go to them.”

The carbon-centric model is one others can follow, Willis says, regardless of a plant’s geographic or geologic footprint. While he notes some plants aren’t able to sequester, he also says every plant can benefit from carbon-related planning or investments, some but not all of which are related to the continuance of the 45Z tax credit.

In addition to the 2024 purchase of a Class VI well which included the leases and easements, Conestoga has also purchased CCS equipment and a CO2 flood field that can use fermentation CO2 for enhanced oil and natural gas recovery efforts in Kansas. The Class VI well work has now moved onto the permitting stage for the U.S. EPA to review.

In August, Conestoga also acquired SAFFiRE Renewables LLC from Southwest Airlines Renewable Ventures LLC. As envisioned, SAFFiRE’s process technology will enable the production of ultra low-carbon intensity ethanol and intermediates.

Willis says his team is working on the buildout of a pilot plant at the Arkalon facility that could be ready by Q4 2026.

The SAFFiRE technology will aid Conestoga’s efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel feedstock. “The IP acquired in this transaction will provide us with tremendous optionality, not only as it relates to SAF feedstock production, but across our operations,” Willis said in August. “The momentum behind low-CI fuels is undeniable, driven by regulatory requirements, corporate commitments and environmental necessity.”

On top of the Class VI well work, investment in SAFFiRE and the overarching company approach to become a multifaceted low-carbon solutions provider that just happens to make ethanol, Conestoga is planning to invest in paying and training farmers for grain traceability. Such an effort will further reduce the plant’s CI score and help make Conestoga’s sustainability-infused growth plan “sustainable,” Willis says.

One Earth Sequestration

Since first partnering with the Illinois State Geological Survey in 2020, Illinois-based One Earth Energy continues to make progress on a CCS well and CO2 pipeline project that would capture and inject fermentation CO2. A proposed 5.62 mile underground pipeline would move fermentation CO2 from the ethanol plant to an injection well that has already been drilled.

Steve Kelly, general manager for the plant near Gibson City, says his team continues to work through the EPA to receive the Class VI permit for the well. The EPA expects a final permit decision in March 2026, according to the agency’s Class VI well permit tracker.

One Earth Energy created a website—One Earth Sequestration—to keep the public updated on the project, specifically around water quality and safety. The new website explains the state-of-the-art safety features that will be used, including automatic shut-off valves, around-the-clock in-person monitoring, reduced pipeline segments, leak detection, flow measurement devices, monitoring wells, six-foot burial and underground signage and more. Kelly and the team have also organized hazmat training hosted by the Illinois Fire Service, in addition to specific CO2 pipeline training hosted by ExxonMobil. The current work is all in addition to the pre-feasibility and geological studies One Earth Energy already completed to ensure such a project would be economically and environmentally sound, Kelly says.

The next milestones on the timeline revolve around the Class VI permit, acquiring the Certificate of Authority from the Illinois Commerce Commission to construct a CO2 pipeline and securing a Special Use Permit in McLean County, Illinois, at the sequestration well site.

Kelly says the company has worked with governing bodies ranging from local municipalities up to state and federal agencies. It has also worked with landowners to voluntarily secure pore space and pipeline lease agreements. One Earth has held more than 70 public meetings or sessions with farmers.

The CCS work and investment will impact the plant and community in multiple ways, Kelly says. “Once completed, our CCS will capture and compress 521,000 metric tons of CO2 annually. That’s like taking nearly 124,000 gasoline-powered cars off the road for one year.”

According to One Earth Sequestration, the project will generate $231 million in economic activity for Ford County, Illinois, including more than 300 new jobs and nearly $19 million in county and state tax revenue.

“For One Earth Energy, it means we’ll have the opportunity to expand our business into sustainable aviation fuel, which is the next step in renewable fuels,” Kelly says. “It also brings additional stability and longevity to our business and community.”

Chief Ethanol Set for November

Nebraska-based Chief Ethanol General Manager Wayne Garrett joined Brooke Rollins, USDA Secretary, in Nebraska in August to talk biofuels, agriculture and America’s renewable energy future. In November, Garrett expects to be capturing CO2 from fermentation ethanol.

Starting in 2021, Chief Ethanol partnered with Catahoula Resources and the Energy Minerals Group along with Battelle to develop CCS solutions for Chief’s two ethanol plants in Nebraska.

The new CCS infrastructure will capture and store 350,000 metric tons of CO2 through compression stations that will ultimately link to a Catahoula operated pipeline solution.

Gevo Selling Carbon Credits

Gevo Inc. has already earned dividends from its $210 million acquisition of a North Dakota Ethanol plant fully equiped with operating CCS assets. After purchasing Red Trail Energy in early 2025, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber renamed the assets Net-Zero North.

In July, Gevo announced it was officially selling carbon abatement credits into the market. The CCS process creates a carbon removal credit or CO2 removal certificate (CORC). In Gevo’s case, a global financial and technology company purchases CORCs and then retires them to meet its own CO2 abatement requirements.

Puro.earth, a Nasdaq-funded firm that certifies CORCs across the globe and provides a marketplace for suppliers and buyers, provided certification of the Gevo produced CORCs.

“Gevo is demonstrating that durable carbon removal isn’t some distant solution,” says Trenton Spindler, chief growth officer of Puro.earth, “It’s available now. With Puro.earth. certified CORCs, buyers worldwide can act decisively to tackle their toughest emissions with confidence in real, permanent results.”

Puro.earth has strict standards for CORC generation, including 1,000-plus-year permeance of storage. In July, Puro.earth’s CORC index showed CORC prices at roughly $150 each. From 2020 to November 2024, Puro.earth said the use of CORCs increased by 1,200%, rising from 12,000 units produced and sold per year to nearly 160,000. Starting in 2022, many CORC buyers began seeking offtake agreements of three- to five-year periods, but by 2024, many larger CORC buyers were looking for even longer-term CORC supply agreements.

Blue Flint’s CCS Tax Equity Benefits

CCS work at Harvestone Low Carbon Partners’ Blue Flint Ethanol plant in North Dakota continues to pay off. After commencing operation of a 125,000-metric-ton CO2 capture infrastructure and pipeline project in 2023, HLCP announced nearly a year later that it had closed on a first-of-its-kind tax equity financing round with Bank of America worth $205 million.

HLCP was able to structure a tax equity financing package that would allow Bank of America to participate in the 45Q federal tax credit benefits and purchase 45Z clean fuel tax credits generated by Blue Flint’s CCS biorefinery operations.

Karen Fang, global head of sustainable finance at Bank of America, says her team has a strong track record of innovative financing transactions for decarbonization technologies including CCS. Essentially, Bank of America receives that tax credit benefit in exchange for financing. HLCP has not said how it will utilize any Bank of America proceeds, but it does operate additional ethanol facilities that are actively developing or studying CCS infrastructure in North Dakota and Indiana.

Permitting in Process

The Andersons Inc. has acquired full ownership of the four ethanol plants it previously co-owned with a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp., a move the publicly traded grain and biofuels company says will allow for greater efficiency and streamlining of its operations. In its Q2 earnings call, the company stated that the regulatory environment for biofuels, “may support new opportunities,” including at the company’s Clymers, Indiana, facility where a Class VI well permit has been filed with the EPA for CCS.

Front Range Energy in Colorado continues developing its CCS operation, with a completed test well on its property, and is awaiting the Class VI permit. Through a subsidiary called Carbon Capture Solutions, Front Range Energy is playing a part in shaping the future regulatory and compliance framework for CCS in Colorado. In December 2024, representatives from Carbon Capture Solutions participated in discussions with the Colorado Energy & Carbon Management Commission (ECMC) regarding state-level authority over geologic carbon storage. ECMC has now created a state-based policy on CCS with the goal of obtaining primacy over the EPA, similar to other states, including North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana.

In California, Aemetis awaits approval of its Class VI well permit for CCS operation that will inject roughly 1.4 million tons of CO2 into a saline formation. Baker Hughes, an oil and gas drilling company, is leading the underground engineering and drilling work, including consultation and project design. ATSI, an engineering, procurement, construction and project management firm, is helping on the project as well.

Expertise and Experience

Vault 44.01 is contracted or partnered with seven different ethanol producers. The CCS experts help each create on-site or near on-site CCS capabilities. Scott Rennie, president and CEO of Vault 44.01, says despite a range of challenges each plant may face, Vault 44.01 has a unique combination of technical expertise and CCS experience.

Hugh Caperton, senior vice president of development for Vault, says the company has grown a presence across the ethanol sector because it has expertise in all facets required to make a CCS project successful, including landowner agreements, commercial development structuring, technical expertise and permitting.

Cardinal Ethanol was the first to join with Vault 44.01. Today, other Vault 44.01 partners include plants owned by Valero, POET and Alto Ingredients. Cardinal Ethanol could earn its Class VI well permit in January 2026, according to projections by the EPA tracker database.

Rennie is quick to point out that the state where a CCS project is located greatly impacts the timeline for completion. North Dakota has seen multiple projects completed because the state has primacy over CCS regulations and permitting. States without primacy must rely on federal regulations, drawing out the timeline. The current administration has made a big difference in the speed at which the Vault team can move on permitting progress, Rennie says.

“We’ve made more progress on our permits recently than we have in the previous two years under the past administration,” Rennie says.

Like Rennie, Caperton is optimistic about the pace of project timelines in 2025 and beyond. He points out that CCS has always had bipartisan support in Congress. Every project will have challenges in design, community engagement and permitting.

“For us, it comes down to having the right skillset and energy level to bring these things to completion,” Rennie says. “Our team had a track record even before we started helping ethanol producers.”

Both Rennie and Caperton believe the ethanol sector’s CCS abilities will act as a seed from which producers and future industries can grow.

“CCS is a gateway,” Caperton says.

For its current producer partners, Vault is focusing on on-site or near on-site CCS. Initially, the team explored options to create connected CO2 sequestration hubs. Rennie says the economics and land commitment agreements were too difficult to pursue. The cost of running and operating pipeline can sometimes be in the range of $1 million or more per half mile. Some CO2 hubs connecting ethanol plants would need at least 40 miles of pipeline, Rennie explains, as most plants in a concentrated area suitable for a hub are 40 to 50 miles apart.

In most cases, Vault is capturing a single source of CO2 and has a flowline on the producer’s property connected to a sequestration or compression station.

“If you were to look at our projects from outer space, the projects are going to look very similar,” Rennie says.

In March last year, Alto Ingredients signed with Vault to further its CCS aspirations. Through the agreement, Alto will install CCS equipment at its Pekin, Illinois, dry mill, and Vault will transport and permanently store the CO2 underground within close proximity.

Bryon McGregor, president and CEO of Alto, says the agreement with Vault will serve shareholders and community stakeholders alike. In addition to operating two ethanol production facilities, Alto operates a liquid CO2 facility in Boardman, Oregon. In early 2025, Alto acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a beverage-grade liquid carbon dioxide processor for $7.25 million.

“In our ongoing pursuit to optimize product value, we identified the beverage-grade liquid CO2 plant as a significant opportunity and pursued the acquisition to continue to expand our premium ingredients portfolio,” McGregor says.

The Time Is Now for On-Site CCS

Rennie says there has never been a better time for CO2 producers like Alto, Cardinal Ethanol and others to pursue CCS. “Now is the right time. The industry has learned a lot about CCS and the current administration has a proclivity for action and accountability.

“The project with Alto exemplifies our view that one of the best options for CCS is often a local solution.”

Sylvain Riba, president and CEO of the Houston-based team of underground energy storage and subsurface injection experts at Geostock Sandia, says the ethanol industry has maintained CCUS momentum since an uptick started in 2020. Riba and his team have been involved with eight ethanol-related CCS wells in the Midwest over the past five years, including the well for North Dakota’s Blue Flint Ethanol.

“We make the earth the best place to store energy,” Riba says. “We know how to drill wells and demonstrate this is the right place to store.”

Geostock Sandia expanded its drilling services for Class VI wells in the early 2000s and has since been a big participant in the CarbonSAFE program under the U.S. Department of Energy. Prior to that, Geostock Sandia helped lead the creation of salt cavern storage for hydrocarbons in the U.S.

Like the natural gas industry, Riba says many ethanol producers are now aware of the value and need for storing carbon.

“A lot of producers realize it’s possible to reduce the intensity of the existing industry and infrastructure in-place,” Riba says.

Successful projects led by teams like Geostock Sandia have helped show what is possible, he adds. The addition of voluntary carbon markets and private equity investors that want to participate in CCS or credit markets has also helped build momentum in the ethanol space.

“If I’m an ethanol producer today, I need to know CCS is safe, it is cost effective and it can really help improve your product,” Riba says.

He explains that a project started in 2025 will still take roughly three years to go through studies, well testing, permitting, infrastructure build-out and additional work, he says. Geostock Sandia can provide management of the process, man the facilities or train current workforce and help maintain the infrastructure for the life of the well. States including North Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska and Indiana are all prime for well drilling, he says.

Because of the work and history of Geostock Sandia, Riba says the process today is simpler than most might think. It’s about logistics and managing the land, all skills ethanol producers already possess, he says. Trading on the carbon market is similar to any other daily process, including managing grain payments, he adds.

“Underground storage is really safe and now the momentum is there and it is a really good time to do it,” Riba says. “You don’t have to bring a lot of technology or create a complex logistics process. It doesn’t have to be that complicated.”

To date, emerging large-load tariff models and other policy mechanisms largely overlook the vast opportunity for data center operators to leverage households as grid assets while investing in tangible benefits for communities.","Ari Matusiak is the founder and CEO of Rewiring America.

Around the country, American families are finding their electricity bills harder and harder to afford. Electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation — and they’re still going up, as utilities requested $29 billion in rate hikes so far this year alone. Low-income families already pay nearly 18% of their income on energy. It’s not adding up for households.

Soaring energy demand from hyperscalers, the tech companies building AI data centers, has shattered two decades of relatively flat electricity use. U.S. electricity demand is projected to grow by 128 GW by 2029 — 93 GW of which is to support data centers.

State officials and utilities feel they have to choose between attracting prospective AI business and enduring long interconnection waiting periods and a volatile national landscape for renewables. Many are opting to resurrect coal plants that had been planned for retirement, or greenlight construction on new gas-fired power plants. And many decision makers view increasingly electric households as passive energy consumers that are in direct competition for a limited power supply.

It doesn’t have to be this way.

There is actually a near-term solution that won’t require forgoing climate pledges or waiting years for new power plants: Data center operators should pay for residential upgrades to heat pumps, rooftop solar and storage — to secure the power they need right now, and establish the grid stability we all need for the future.

It’s time to recognize that households — far from being passive energy consumers — are the foundation of our energy infrastructure, and the hero of our energy story.

The roadmap

This is not just a nice idea. It’s a data-backed solution. In our new report, Homegrown Energy: How household upgrades can meet 100 percent of data center demand growth, we demonstrate how upgrading households is the fastest way for hyperscalers to obtain all the electricity they need — while also contributing towards a flexible, resilient and cost-effective all-electric grid that can support sustained growth in the decades ahead.

We calculated a range of direct benefits that come when hyperscalers and utilities first look to the household to solve their energy system challenges.

In the immediate term, we found that hyperscalers can add roughly 30 GW of capacity nationwide — or one-third of their projected capacity needs through 2029 — by putting heat pumps into households that currently use inefficient electric heating, cooling or water heating.

In Pennsylvania, the figure is even higher. We found that 45% of the state’s projected new data center demand, or 1.3 GW, could come from upgrading inefficient electric heating systems to heat pumps.

This is a cost-competitive option. We calculated that if hyperscalers covered half the upfront installation price of 6.5 million households with electric resistance heating to heat pumps, they could secure grid capacity at a price of roughly $344/kW-year. That’s on par with the cost of building a new gas plant, currently about $315/kW-year.

It’s also a faster option. With average wait times for a new gas plant to come online stretching to seven years or more, looking to the household for capacity is the smart move.

There are significant immediate benefits for households. Energy bills would drop by an average of $740 per year. Reduced outdoor air pollution resulting from the upgrades would lead to $2.3 billion in health benefits, based on our past modeling of health outcomes from electrification. And by pairing these investments with negotiated discounts or standardized installs that achieve economies of scale, hyperscalers would create a virtuous feedback cycle that further lowers upfront costs for households and makes existing state and local incentives more efficient and effective.

Reaching 100%

In a second scenario, we ran the numbers to see what it would take for hyperscalers to find even more capacity from households.

We found that if hyperscalers invested in a home battery for all single-family homes and a 5-kW solar panel system for those with a suitable roof — modest, by residential installation averages — they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. That’s more than the 93 GW that data centers are projected to need. And with installations at that scale, paired with targeted interventions such as streamlining the permitting process, hyperscalers could secure this capacity at costs comparable to building a gas power plant.

Texas could unlock 13.9 GW of capacity through solar, storage and upgrading inefficient central AC systems to heat pumps, which is 80% of the 17 GW of projected new data center capacity needs in the state.

Georgia could unlock 6.9 GW of capacity through solar, storage and upgrading inefficient electric heating systems to heat pumps, which is 100% of the 6.7 GW of projected new data center capacity needs in the state.

And Pennsylvania could unlock a total of 4.5 GW of capacity through solar, storage and upgrading inefficient electric heating systems to heat pumps, which is 150% of the 3 GW of projected new data center capacity needs in the state.

Foundation for the future

This plan is more than feasible. It presents a win-win solution that is available to us right now. And it begs the question: if the household can play such a large role in delivering the solutions we need, why wouldn’t we commit to that path?

The politics facing hyperscalers and utilities alike are increasingly challenging. In just the last few weeks, there has been a surge of articles drawing the link between increasing energy bills at the kitchen table and data centers coming to town. That is a trade ratepayers are unlikely to make, and it threatens the social license for all parties involved.

Read More in Grid Security & Reliability

It’s time for us to reject the false premise that the only way out of this problem is to focus exclusively on adding more inefficient fossil-fueled power plants to the grid, while ignoring the missed opportunity inside each of the millions of households with existing links to the grid.

We have a practical, economic and political imperative to quantify and pay for the benefits that upgrades can bring both to the household itself and also to the system. We must prioritize policies that support this vision.

There are already successful programs in place across the country where households are being tapped in to contribute — from decades of successful energy efficiency initiatives to the more recent uptick in virtual power plant and load shifting programs. To date, emerging large-load tariff models and other policy mechanisms largely overlook the vast opportunity for data center operators to leverage households as grid assets while investing in tangible benefits for communities.

We can pave the way for a modern, all-electric future that lifts up households and industry alike. It’s time we commit to it.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/R-VcWWQHd37bSDrkEHUbfBsTMsVQ5gCLGLJxq6-MT7s/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yVDlUSzc0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-10 12:08:07.222199

As the government shutdown stretches into its second week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not working — and more are not getting paid. The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.

Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.

""I'm feeling energized, honestly,"" says Gorman. ""It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.""

Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.

Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.

Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.

Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.

""To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,"" she says.

""I'm done being afraid""

Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.

Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?

""I'm done being afraid of them,"" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. ""They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.""

NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: ""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""

Connecting with others for support and information

Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.

""They have made us much, much stronger,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.

Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.

""I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,"" she says.

Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.

""I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,"" she says. ""It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.""

With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.

Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.

Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.

""This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.

""I believe very strongly that my job as a civil servant is to carry out the lawful instructions of the sitting administration, regardless of whether I think it's a good policy,"" she says. ""That's my job, and I did it under the first Trump administration.""

But this time, she believes the administration is acting lawlessly, including by sidelining the unions.

""The time for us to stand up and do something about it is now. We might not get another opportunity,"" she says.

However, they do not explicitly mention consumer-performed replacements of 12-volt batteries — a component generally considered a wear-and-tear item in both gasoline and electric vehicles.","EV maker Rivian is facing criticism from consumers after a YouTuber with nearly 10 million followers accused the EV maker of preventing owners from replacing the 12-volt battery, without risking their warranty.

Zack Nelson — known online as JerryRigEverything and followed by over 900,000 users on X and nearly 10 million on YouTube — said in a post that Rivian refused to sell him a 12-volt battery for self-installation after his unit failed.

The company allegedly warned that using a non-Rivian replacement could void the warranty.

“My 12v batteries died after 3.5 years,” Nelson wrote. “However – Rivian won’t sell me a 12v battery to install myself. And they say if I buy anything off the shelf it could void my warranty.”

He shared a repair invoice showing Rivian charged $775.04 to replace two 12-volt batteries, including $511.30 in parts and $231 in labor, a cost he compared to what he once paid for an entire car.

“The kicker? Rivian charges $775.04 dollars to replace the two 12v batteries. (That’s what I paid for my first car and it came with a 12v battery,)” he wrote.

As of press time, the post had reached 1.2 million people and gathered 19,000 likes.

The tech reviewer contrasted Rivian’s stance with how a similar situation would be handled with his Tesla Cybertruck.

“I could snap my Cybertuck in half and Tesla would give me a manual on how to glue it back together,” he wrote. “But Rivian won’t even let me replace a 12v battery on my own.”

The post quickly spread on social media, reigniting a debate over automakers’ “right-to-repair” policies.

One of the top-voted comments noted that if Rivian’s policy discourages third-party parts or self-service, it could violate the’ Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act’ and Federal Trade Commission rules.

The rules prohibit conditioning warranty coverage on the use of branded parts.

Under 15 U.S.C. § 2302(c) and 16 CFR § 700.10, manufacturers cannot tie warranty validity to the use of their own authorized parts or service unless those parts are provided free of charge or the company has obtained a waiver from the FTC.

David Barclay, who served at the FTC, posted the relevant section of federal law on X, calling Rivian’s practice “illegal under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and FTC rules.”

The company’s warranty terms state that repairs must be performed by Rivian or authorized service centers.

However, they do not explicitly mention consumer-performed replacements of 12-volt batteries — a component generally considered a wear-and-tear item in both gasoline and electric vehicles.

Rivian’s design originally featured two compact 12-volt batteries, positioned side by side near the firewall to free up additional space in the front trunk, according to the X user Alex Edgerton.

After a software malfunction in 2023 temporarily disrupted 12-volt charging and created a shortage of replacement units, the company revised the setup—substituting one of the batteries with a capacitor.

Although it appears identical from the outside, the new component doesn’t store power, and Rivian’s manuals and documentation still refer to both units as batteries, Edgerton noted this Thursday.

As reported earlier this week, Rivian is preparing to replace Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant with Google’s Gemini AI platform in its vehicles.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GkLShrbX0AAHFwr.jpeg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-10 11:01:08.652867

The amendment Stein mentioned—introduced by Republican Senate leader Phil Berger—aims to effectively circumvent the lethal injection lawsuits.
North Carolina hasn’t used a gas chamber since 1998 and hasn’t electrocuted anyone since 1936.
Stein’s decision to sign Iryna’s Law—or allow it to become law without his signature—was seen as a fait accompli.
“Governor Stein chose cruelty over justice,” Deborah Dicks Maxwell, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement.","Dodging the Bullet

When Gov. Josh Stein signed the Republicans’ crime bill into law on October 3, he released a short video explaining his rationale.

Lawmakers passed the bill, dubbed Iryna’s Law, on September 23 in reaction to the brutal slaying of Iryna Zarutska on Charlotte’s light rail a month earlier. Her killer, Decarlos Brown Jr., suffers from schizophrenia. The law will require more defendants to be evaluated for mental health issues after their arrests.

“That’s a good thing, and why I have signed it into law,” Stein said. But Stein didn’t like everything in the bill. “Most alarming,” he said, “the General Assembly sprung a last-minute amendment that aims to bring about execution by firing squad to North Carolina. It’s barbaric.”

Stein made a promise: “There will be no firing squads in North Carolina during my time as governor.”

It’s not clear how Stein intends to keep that promise. A spokesperson told The Assembly that the governor “is taking a close look at the requirements under Iryna’s Law and is focused on taking steps to take meaningful action to keep people safe.”

North Carolina hasn’t executed anyone since 2006. Long-stalled litigation over Racial Justice Act claims and the state’s lethal injection protocols has led to a de facto moratorium. The amendment Stein mentioned—introduced by Republican Senate leader Phil Berger—aims to effectively circumvent the lethal injection lawsuits.

It doesn’t explicitly mention firing squads. Instead, it says that if lethal injection is deemed unconstitutional or isn’t available, the secretary of the Department of Adult Correction has to choose an execution method approved in another state. That appears to leave several possibilities: firing squad, nitrogen hypoxia, electric chair, and the gas chamber.

If an execution is scheduled, the secretary—a Stein appointee—could keep the governor’s promise by opting for a non-firing-squad alternative, though none is particularly genteel. North Carolina hasn’t used a gas chamber since 1998 and hasn’t electrocuted anyone since 1936. State prison officials did not immediately respond to questions about how much it would cost to restart these execution methods.

Five states have recently authorized the use of nitrogen hypoxia, in which inmates inhale nitrogen through a mask until they suffocate. Critics have said this method might amount to “torture.” Five states also allow firing squads, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. South Carolina has used it twice this year.

Stein might also hope to dodge the issue altogether. At most, he’ll be governor for seven more years, and it’s possible none of the state’s 122 death row inmates will be eligible for execution before he leaves office.

But Iryna’s Law aims to speed up appeals. If it succeeds, Stein might find himself boxed into an uncomfortable corner.

Before Berger unveiled his amendment to expand execution methods, Iryna’s Law appeared likely to pass with broad bipartisan support. Democrats believed Stein would sign it, according to legislative sources. At least half of Senate Democrats planned to back the bill, as did many House Democrats.

But after Republicans passed the amendment, most Senate Dems walked off the floor, and those who remained voted against the bill. The next day, House Democrats faced a dilemma. Stein’s office didn’t tell them whether his plans had changed, several Democrats said.

Ultimately, 17 Democrats voted for the bill. Most came from Mecklenburg County (where Zarutska was killed), Wake County (whose district attorney, Lorrin Freeman, lobbied for the bill before Berger added his amendment), or competitive districts (Dem leaders told them to “vote for the bill so as to be seen as tough on crime,” one source said).

Robert Reives, the House’s Democratic leader, also voted for it, though he called Berger’s amendment “cynical. … It makes me wonder who we are as a government.”

Senate Republicans have a veto-proof supermajority. In the House, Democrats can sustain a veto—but only if all of them show up and vote together. With 17 defections, it seemed likely that a veto would be easily overridden. Stein’s decision to sign Iryna’s Law—or allow it to become law without his signature—was seen as a fait accompli.

But perhaps not. According to multiple sources familiar with the situation, Reives’ office believed his caucus would have sustained a veto—at least in the short term. Over time, that might get dicier, and Republicans could have called an override vote at any point before the end of next year. A member might also miss a vote due to illness or, um, other unfortunate circumstances (see below).

Senate Democrats sent Stein a letter imploring him to veto a bill they called “fundamentally flawed, legally questionable, and morally wrong,” according to a draft obtained by The Assembly. (A Senate Dem said Stein was “pissed” when he received it.)

Instead, Stein signed the legislation, despite saying it lacked “ambition or vision” and contained a “barbaric” death penalty provision. His decision left some Democrats and their allies fuming.

“Governor Stein chose cruelty over justice,” Deborah Dicks Maxwell, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said in a statement.

The governor’s loudest Democratic critic—publicly, anyway—has been Sen. Graig Meyer of Orange County. Stein’s “decision and his statement on it are such a terrible example of what happens when you abandon principle,” Meyer posted on Substack.

In an interview, Meyer said this episode was indicative of Stein’s term so far. “He won’t touch anything that is an ambitious issue,” he said. “He thinks about what he’s afraid of, what he doesn’t want to touch, and he works backward from there.”

The governor’s office did not respond to The Assembly’s questions about the politics of Iryna’s Law.

Brockman Charged

N.C. Rep. Cecil Brockman, a Guilford County Democrat, is facing bipartisan calls for his resignation after he was charged with multiple sex crimes.

Brockman, 41, was arrested Wednesday and charged with two counts each of indecent liberties with a child and statutory rape. Arrest records show the alleged victim was between the ages of 13 and 15. The offenses are alleged to have taken place on Aug. 15.

Brockman was held without bail in the High Point jail and was scheduled to make his first appearance Thursday at the Guilford County Courthouse. That hearing was postponed at the last minute, when a bailiff said Brockman had a “medical emergency” and was taken to a local hospital.

Democrats including Stein, Roy Cooper, and Anderson Clayton called on him to resign, as did Republican House Speaker Destin Hall.

Meck Yes?

By fall 2020, the Charlotte Moves task force was well on its way to putting together a nearly $20 billion plan to meet the city’s transportation needs for the next 30 years.

There would be rail extensions—including a long-awaited line to north Mecklenburg—as well as road improvements, better bus service, and even an ambitious “micro transit” system that uses on-demand vans to fill gaps. Pieces were falling into place.

That September, the city’s chief financial officer presented the group with a long menu of financing choices that included property and sales taxes, revenue bonds, motor vehicle fees, development fees, federal loans, special tax districts, and private money.

“We really didn’t consider them; I’ll be honest with you,” Harvey Gantt, a Democrat and former mayor, told The Assembly. “The most equitable tax is the sales tax.”

“Before mass timber, we didn’t have a market-ready bio-based structural solution that was competitive with concrete and steel.” Now we do.","From the moment you approach and enter Amazon’s new delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana, you know you’re somewhere special. First, there’s the wood that makes up much of the walls and the ceiling. Then there are the windows, vast expanses of glass that bathe the interior in sunshine. Oh, and the more than 170 electric-vehicle charging stalls just outside.

This is indeed a new kind of delivery station. And those elements that are obvious at a glance are just a few of the ways we’re powering another effort central to our future.

DII5, as we call it, is not just a delivery station. It doubles as an exercise in sustainability, packed with more than 40 market-ready technologies and systems designed to reduce its resource usage and shrink its carbon footprint.

We designed our new delivery station to help us reduce our carbon footprint as well as our resource usage across our global network of buildings. Photos by Kendall McCaugherty and Dronegenuity

And it’s not just meant to make a difference in Elkhart. We’re counting on DII5 to give us vital data on how those sustainability initiatives work in our facilities. The goal is to find out which offer the right balance of cost and performance, and which we might be able to scale across our global operations, taking their impact way beyond one building.

“We have experimented with and implemented a lot of sustainability initiatives over the years,” says Daniel Mallory, Amazon’s vice president of global realty. “DII5 continues that effort by taking a culmination of a lot of big ideas not just in how we operate our facilities, but in how we build them. And it’s going to help us as we steadily climb toward our sustainability goals.”

Globally, buildings and construction account for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Carbon Leadership Forum. As we work to meet our Climate Pledge commitment to operate more efficiently and sustainably and to decarbonize our entire global operations by 2040, we’re investigating and investing in building strategies that increase energy efficiency, prioritize carbon-free energy, use lower-carbon construction materials, and reduce water consumption and waste generation.

DII5, then, is much more than a single node in a global network of fulfillment centers, delivery stations, office buildings, data centers, grocery stores, and entertainment venues. It builds on how we think about all of our buildings and our operations, and serves as one more tool for learning more about how to make a difference.

Let’s take a look

We’ll start with the bones.

DII5’s wooden walls (which are made from over half a million board feet of southern yellow pine and sit atop a foundation of lower-carbon concrete) are made of a material called “mass timber,” or “engineered wood.” It’s a material we’ve been using for years (including at our HQ2 in Arlington, Virginia), and one we’re working to implement at a larger scale.

Mass timber is made by combining pieces of softwood trees like spruce, fir, and pine, the kind of lumber you can buy at your local hardware store. Those pieces are glued or laminated together, resulting in a material that can hold its own against concrete and steel in terms of structural strength, is less carbon-intensive to produce, and locks in the carbon that the trees sequestered before they were harvested.

“Trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere, store it in the cells of their fiber,” says Kristen Dotson, Amazon’s principal for sustainable buildings. “If we can lock up that material in the building for 50 to 100 years, we’re creating a carbon ‘bank’ that keeps that sequestered carbon from being re-released into the atmosphere.”

The net effect is that going with mass timber can put a serious dent in a building’s carbon footprint: A 2022 study found that on average, the embodied greenhouse gas emissions of buildings made of reinforced concrete are 43% higher than those of mass timber structures.

“The game-changing part around mass timber is that it’s taking a ready commodity and turning it into this structural element that can replace much of the concrete and steel that goes into a building,” Dotson says. “Before mass timber, we didn’t have a market-ready bio-based structural solution that was competitive with concrete and steel.”

Now we do.

Collaboration station

Of course, we couldn’t do this alone. To bring DII5 to life, we worked with Graycor as the general contractor, ZGF as design architect and sustainability lead, and Atlantic AE as the architect of record. Climate Pledge Fund company CarbonCure provided the lower-carbon concrete technology.

Other companies including Sterling Structural, Ozinga, TimberHP, and local manufacturer Arborwood also played crucial roles in bringing this facility to life, demonstrating how sustainability innovation can drive economic opportunity.

“DII5 challenges the idea of what a logistics facility can be,” says Marty Brennan, principal at ZGF Architects. “Amazon’s scale and commitment to sustainability allowed us to push boundaries with our design, bringing together numerous partners from across the building industry to create a welcoming experience of light, wood, and native prairies that nurture Amazon associates, delivery service partners, and local wildlife.”

The company plans to expand its reach further into DFW and create a hardware factory near its Austin headquarters.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” Base Power CEO and Co-founder Zach Dell said. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

Base Power was founded in 2023 by COO Justin Lopas and Dell, the son of Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell. The factory will occupy rented space in the printing plant of the Austin American-Statesman. Base currently provides services in Fort Worth, Arlington, and Plano. The company plans to expand to Dallas, Irving, Coppell, and North Richland Hills.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” Lopas said. “The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second. We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrializing America and reinventing the grid.”

Since launching two years ago, Base Power has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity, putting it on pace to be one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the U.S., including partnerships with homebuilders such as Lennar.

Applied Digital Begins Execution in $5 Billion AI Infrastructure Partnership

Applied Digital, a Dallas-based data center company, has secured $112.5 million in initial funding from a $5 billion equity facility with Macquarie Asset Management. The money will be used to construct a data center called Polaris Forge 1 in Ellendale, North Dakota.

“Securing this funding at the asset level is especially important in an asset-heavy business like ours. It gives us the capital to complete Polaris Forge 1 and provides a clear path to scale additional campuses,” Applied Digital Chairman and CEO Wes Cummins said. “With MAM’s expertise and relationships, we believe Applied Digital is positioned as one of the fastest-growing developers in the U.S.”

Applied Digital does not plan to make any other equity contributions to the Polaris Forge 1 project. The partnership with MAM is intended to reduce contribution requirements for Applied Digital.

Universal Technical Institute to Expand its Dallas Campus

The Universal Technical Institute is expanding its UTI-Dallas campus, located in Irving. The expansion will allow for the enrollment of 1,000 new students and a variety of new programs, including automation technology and wind turbine technology. A second building will also be constructed near the campus.

“There is incredible demand for workforce training programs—employers are seeking to quickly fill their talent pipelines, while more students are considering alternatives to traditional college that offer meaningful careers,” UTI Corporate COO Todd Hitchcock said. “We are addressing the nation’s worker shortages by partnering with industry to increase access to our programs that are widely recognized for their strong student outcomes and employer satisfaction.”

The expansion is part of UTI’s North Star strategy, intended to increase the number of skilled workers in America.

The Ohio EPA approved SOBE's 10-year pyrolysis permit in February of 2024. Following this, the City of Youngstown filed an appeal with the Environmental Appeals Commission (ERAC) to have that permit rescinded.

This effort was supported by the group SOBE Concerned Citizens, who held a town hall meeting in August of 2025 to collect signatures on a letter to the Ohio EPA director to rescind the permit.

According to a press release from SOBE Concerned Citizens, over 220 Youngstown residents signed that letter.

In addition to the request to rescind the permit, the letter also asks the EPA to schedule an inspection of SOBE's facility, and if it has already, to share the results of that inspection with Youngstown's residents.

""SOBE operates with one pipe connected to a boiler fired by natural gas in a semi truck trailer to provide the steam heating and cooling for our downtown businesses. Why is SOBE allowed to vent methane directly into the air when burning natural gas to fire the boiler,"" the letter reads.

In a separate letter to the Ohio EPA, the group said it confirmed with Youngstown's Assistant City Attorney that the 10-year permit is considered an asset that may be sold as part of the receivership proceedings.

This means if someone else buys SOBE's facility while the permit is still in effect, it can be transferred to them without proper review or public input.

Shaun Bugbee, executive vice president of operations for BMW of North America, attributed the weaker EV sales to limited supply.","Ford is canceling its own version of an electric vehicle leasing program that effectively extended the EV $7,500 federal tax credit that expired on September 30. The news comes just a few days after General Motors abruptly canceled its identical plan thanks to pressure from two Republican senators who claim the automakers were ""bilking the U.S. taxpayer."" Give me a break. Ford said it would continue to offer discounted leases on EVs through December, but it would do so without claiming the tax credit. It's not immediately clear if those discounts equal the $7,500 credit amount. GM, on the other hand, will run its $7,500 credit program through the end of October.

Both automakers used their financing arms to make pre-emptive down payments on EVs that were already in dealership inventory before the tax credits expired on September 30. It — theoretically — allowed them to claim the tax credit on those vehicles and give the benefit of that incentive to customers who later agreed to lease them. From Automotive News:

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today to continue providing customers with more affordable electric vehicle options,"" spokesperson Said Deep said in an Oct. 9 statement. ""For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives.""

[...]

GM reversed course Oct. 8 after Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former dealer who represents Ohio, and Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming contacted Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the companies' plans to use what the senators called a ""loophole"" in the law eliminating the tax credit.

The IRS in August issued guidance saying the credit still could be claimed if a vehicle was ""placed in service"" after September, so long as the vehicle already had been acquired with payment made.

While deals like these might sound like a good way to help customers save money on the vehicles they'd like to buy, not everyone (read: Republican senators who used to be dealers) agrees.

""This guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer,"" Moreno and Barrasso wrote to Bessent in a letter dated Sept. 30. ""It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal downpayment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months. Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors.""

When AutoNews asked Ford why it was canceling the program just two weeks after it was rolled out, the automaker said, ""Ford makes its own decisions.""

We've reached out to Ford for more clarity on the situation, and we'll update this story when and if we get more information.

Nearly 280 workers at General Motors' Factory Zero electric vehicle manufacturing plant will remain on layoff for the rest of the calendar year. The automaker told employees at the Detroit-Hamtramck facility on August 27 that it planned to partially shut down first- and second-shift production temporarily starting on September 2. GM builds the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Escalade IQ at the facility. From the Detroit Free Press:

""As recently shared, General Motors is making strategic production adjustments in alignment with expected slower EV industry growth and customer demand,"" said a statement sent by GM spokesman Kevin Kelly. ""We will continue to evaluate and adjust operations based on the market and customer demand.""

GM first said on April 10 that it was temporarily cutting approximately 200 jobs. About 160 more workers started a layoff the day after Labor Day and were meant to return to work Oct. 6.

About 80 of the originally impacted employees received job opportunities within the company.

It's pretty wild that, for all the build-up surrounding Factory Zero and all of the delays it faced before opening, it's already dealing with prolonged temporary layoffs. Hopefully, for these workers' sake, things are back up and running sooner rather than later.

BMW won back the top luxury sales spot from Lexus in the third quarter of 2025, selling 96,886 vehicles to beat the Japanese automaker by a tight margin of 5,277 units. Lexus made itself the sales king in Q2 of this year, but it seems that victory was rather short-lived. In any case, both automakers are expected to set sales records this year.

Part of BMW's strategy right now is bringing in 2026 model year vehicles early. According to Edmunds data, 2026 MY vehicles made up 51% of BMW Q3 sales and just 4.8% of Lexus'. However, Lexus dealers were able to turn inventory faster in the quarter. BMW's took an average of 46 days to sell, whereas the average Lexus was gone in 22 days. From Automotive News:

BMW's third-quarter sales surged 25 percent from a year earlier, when the brand was hampered by a significant recall and stop-sale for faulty brake modules.

Strong demand for BMW's plug-in hybrids and crossovers powered sales in the quarter. Plug-in hybrid deliveries rose 37 percent from last year, offsetting a 16 percent slide in EV sales.

Shaun Bugbee, executive vice president of operations for BMW of North America, attributed the weaker EV sales to limited supply.

BMW took a ""measured reduction"" in EV production in May and June, when there was uncertainty about tariffs, customer demand and the federal tax credit, Bugbee said.

The brand's EV sales in September increased more than 30 percent as buyers rushed to dealerships before the federal subsidy expired at month's end.

[...]

Lexus' third-quarter sales reached 91,609, up 13 percent from last year.

Shawn Domeracki, Lexus' vice president of sales and dealer development, said the brand's U.S. sales were on track to achieve a record of about 355,000 for the year.

He credited two models for driving the pace: the redesigned GX midsize SUV and the three-row TX large crossover. Through nine months, GX sales were up 35 percent this year, at 28,244, while TX volume increased 86 percent to 39,546.

Coming in third was Mercedes-Benz. In the quarter, sales actually fell 13% to about 73,500 passenger vehicles. The automaker attributed the decline to higher sales earlier in the year. There may be something to that. Through the third quarter, retail sales were up 6% to about 223,800 vehicles — putting MB on track to surpass last year's rough total of 302,000 vehicles.

Overall, the U.S. luxury segment grew 4.5% in the third quarter, which is actually slightly less than the 5.6% the rest of the market grew. Rounding out the top five when it comes to luxury sales were Audi (46,758 vehicles) and Cadillac (46,525 vehicles — up 25% year-over-year).

Toyota is recalling about 394,000 2022-2025 Tundras and Tundra Hybrids, as well as 2023-2025 Sequoia Hybrids, because of an issue with the rearview camera. Apparently, there's some sort of software issue with the 14-inch infotainment screen that might cause it to display a ""half green, full green, or full black screen. This is not ideal, especially in trucks this big. From USA Today:

""If this occurs while the vehicle is being reversed, the vehicle may not meet a federal safety standard and there can be an increased risk of a crash with a person behind the vehicle,"" Toyota said in an Oct. 1 notice.

[...]

While three different models were technically included in the recall, Toyota clarified that only ""certain"" vehicles might be experiencing the issue.

Every unnecessary delay, form, and regulation is a hidden tax on our most precious resource: time.
The time tax is real — and it’s time to treat it that way.","Modern discussions of inequality focus on wealth gaps and wage stagnation. But there’s an equally sinister version of inequality that doesn’t pit billionaires against the poor. It involves the administrative state’s pilfering a valuable resource from anyone trying to get ahead: time.

“Time inequality” is less visible, harder to measure, and arguably more corrosive than income inequality. One of the greatest achievements of liberal markets has been the steady increase in individuals’ leisure time. Whereas people with fewer means once labored from sunup to sundown to survive, they now enjoy more time for family, rest, and self-improvement. Liberal markets delivered this miracle, but government bureaucracies are quietly taking it back.

For working-class Americans, navigating government systems is like a second job that doesn’t pay the bills. Need to renew your driver’s license? That’s half a day gone. Start a side business? Expect to spend months navigating complex licensing processes, completing paperwork, obtaining approvals, and making repeat visits. File a zoning variance? Bring snacks.

These aren’t mere annoyances. They’re regressive, invisible taxes on time — imposing the greatest burden on those with the least resources. A 2016 study by researchers at the consulting firm Management Lab revealed that bureaucratic waste — including delays and overregulation — costs America 17 percent of its GDP. This number represents real hours lost, opportunities denied, and lives hindered.

The wealthy have ways around all this. They can hire assistants, pay for expedited services, or simply take time off without financial strain. But for the poor, every government-imposed delay comes at a real cost: lost wages, missed shifts, and less time with family.

Consider the maze of occupational licensing laws that govern over 20 percent of U.S. jobs. Want to braid hair, drive a food truck, or give tours? In many states, you’ll need to pay fees, pass tests, and complete hundreds of hours of training. In these cases, it’s not just money being extracted. It’s time. To obtain a cosmetology license in New Mexico, for example, one must complete more than 1,600 hours of instruction. Burdensome requirements such as this are designed to protect incumbents, who benefit from high hurdles that keep out new competition.

Worse still, even after meeting every costly, time-consuming requirement, many find themselves blocked by arbitrary bureaucratic vetoes. Policies like “certificates of need” let government officials decide — often with no justification — that an individual’s services aren’t needed, regardless of that person’s qualifications. That’s precisely what happened to Ursula Newell-Davis, a licensed social worker in Louisiana who has spent years fighting to provide respite care for vulnerable children, only to be told the state doesn’t believe that those children “need” her help. The prospect of having to navigate this rigged system often leads people to give up before they begin.

Some people who are hurt by arbitrary hurdles seek help from the courts. But legal recourse, too, can be a marathon. Take the Supreme Court case Sackett v. EPA. The Sacketts wanted to build a modest home on their land in Idaho. However, the Environmental Protection Agency claimed jurisdiction over their property and threatened to fine them tens of thousands of dollars per day unless they got an expensive permit. The couple fought back — and won. But it took a full 16 years to vindicate their rights.

Here’s the good news: There are solutions.

First, lawmakers should kill deadweight licensure requirements. There’s no reason for someone to need government permission to, for example, do makeup, arrange flowers, or braid hair. There should be no public gatekeeping if there’s no significant public risk. And if some states don’t regulate an occupation and have no problems, that’s a good reason for all other states to rethink their restrictions.

Second, everything should be streamlined. If a government process takes more than 30 days, requires multiple in-person visits, or can’t be completed online, then it’s broken. Implement response-time caps, default approvals, and digital filing for everything. If Amazon can process millions of orders daily, our local governments can issue building permits without dragging the process out for months. Furthermore, regulatory audits shouldn’t measure only monetary costs — they should also measure time burden.

Finally, courts should treat bureaucratic time-wasting — particularly when it burdens people’s right to earn a living — as a matter of constitutional concern. Courts reflexively defer to regulators’ determination that a law is necessary, even when rules arbitrarily block people from earning a living. But if a law consumes people’s time without a clear public benefit, courts should strike it down.

Every unnecessary delay, form, and regulation is a hidden tax on our most precious resource: time. And that tax is anything but equal.

At the same time, Zhang explained, the researchers found no detectable increase in daily emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides.
They then compared power plants' daily operations and emission behaviors before and after the EPA furlough to detect any short-term changes resulting from the temporary absence of regulatory inspections and enforcement.
The researchers found that the aerosol concentration of particulate matter surrounding the power plants increased significantly during the EPA's furlough.
During the furlough, aerosol concentrations within a three-kilometer radius of the power plants were higher by 0.018-0.022, on average.","Power plants may emit higher amounts of pollution during lapses in federal monitoring and enforcement, such as during a government shutdown, according to a new study led by researchers at Penn State.

The study, published in the Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, details the short-term effects of enforcement of federal environmental laws and regulations on power plant air emissions.

Using data from the 2018-19 federal government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, as a natural experiment, the researchers found that coal-fired power plants increased daily emissions of particulate matter - tiny solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air - during the furlough of federal employees.

This increase may be caused by the temporary reduction of efforts from the power plants to limit pollution, according to Ruohao Zhang, assistant professor of agricultural economics in the College of Agricultural Sciences and lead author on the paper.

At the same time, Zhang explained, the researchers found no detectable increase in daily emissions of sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides. This was likely because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Markets Division has monitored and enforced limitations on these pollutants continuously since 1995, so they were not affected by the government shutdown.

Zhang said the findings are important because even small increases of pollution can affect human health. They also suggest that inspections and enforcement efforts are crucial for mitigating pollution both in the long run and on a daily basis.

""Interruptions in inspections and enforcement have the potential to trigger immediate environmental and health consequences,"" he said. ""Moving forward, policies should ensure stable inspection capacity, minimize enforcement gaps and expand continuous emission monitoring.""

The EPA plays a key role in ensuring compliance with federal environmental laws and regulations, the researchers said, with monitoring and enforcement activities as its primary responsibility.

However, the EPA's resources for these activities have declined over time, with shrinking budgets and reduced enforcement staff. Consequently, the number of inspections and time for enforcement have also decreased over the years.

""This reduction in monitoring and enforcement raises concerns about the weakening of regulatory stringency and environmental compliance,"" Zhang said. ""We wanted to investigate the effect of reduced monitoring and enforcement efforts on firms' pollution and compliance with environmental regulations.""

However, the researchers said studying the impact of reduced monitoring and enforcement can be challenging. Fewer inspections may simply indicate strong compliance, for example. Additionally, it can be difficult to pinpoint the effectiveness of monitoring and enforcement in achieving or maintaining regulatory compliance.

For the study, the researchers compiled data from several sources. A list of coal-fired power plants came from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and data on emissions and operations - including daily power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, as well as daily heat input, electricity generation and steam production - came from the EPA's Air Market Program.

They then compared power plants' daily operations and emission behaviors before and after the EPA furlough to detect any short-term changes resulting from the temporary absence of regulatory inspections and enforcement.

The researchers found that the aerosol concentration of particulate matter surrounding the power plants increased significantly during the EPA's furlough. The average aerosol optical depth - a measurement of how many aerosols are in the atmosphere - for the U.S. is 0.1 to 0.15. During the furlough, aerosol concentrations within a three-kilometer radius of the power plants were higher by 0.018-0.022, on average.

""Studies have shown that even short-lived increases in particulate matter have the potential to worsen public health outcomes,"" Zhang said. ""Evidence links small increases of fine particulate matter with diameters of 2.5 micrometers or less to higher mortality risks. Stable enforcement and continuous monitoring are useful tools for ensuring compliance, reducing emissions and protecting health.""

New factory in Austin to anchor U.S. energy resilience and grid modernisation efforts.

Participation in Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource program enables homeowners to feed power directly into the grid.

Austin startup aims to decentralize the grid

Base Power, a fast-growing energy technology company based in Austin, has raised $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the rollout of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by venture firm Addition, with participation from Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, and Elad Gil, as well as new investors including Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The funding positions Base Power among the most well-capitalized startups in the U.S. energy transition, reflecting investor confidence in distributed energy solutions as the grid faces mounting strain from extreme weather, ageing infrastructure, and rising electrification demand.

CEO and co-founder Zach Dell said the company is driven by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent how power is generated, stored, and shared. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” he said.

Distributed storage meets domestic manufacturing

Base Power’s business model revolves around leasing batteries directly to homeowners, offering reliable backup power while allowing participants to sell excess energy back to the grid. This decentralised system strengthens grid resilience and helps integrate renewable energy, addressing one of the core challenges of the U.S. clean energy transition: balancing supply and demand in real time.

As part of its expansion strategy, Base Power is developing its first energy storage and power electronics manufacturing facility at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin. The company plans to establish additional facilities to meet surging demand for distributed battery systems.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware,” said co-founder and COO Andrew Lopas. “We need to make that hardware here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning our second.”

By investing in domestic production, Base Power is aligning with national efforts to reindustrialize the energy sector, reduce dependence on imported components, and strengthen supply chain resilience — a priority under the Biden administration’s clean energy and manufacturing policies.

Powering the grid from the ground up

Base Power recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to aggregate thousands of home batteries and sell electricity directly into the state’s power market. The initiative could prove pivotal for grid operators struggling with growing demand volatility and the integration of intermittent renewables.

The company’s distributed model also complements recent federal initiatives encouraging grid-edge technologies, such as the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program. With utilities and regulators seeking cost-effective ways to improve reliability, distributed batteries — collectively acting as “virtual power plants” — are emerging as a scalable alternative to large, centralized infrastructure.

For investors, the model offers exposure to one of the fastest-growing segments of the energy transition: behind-the-meter storage. BloombergNEF projects U.S. residential battery capacity could increase fivefold by 2030, driven by falling costs, rising solar adoption, and regional incentive programs.

Rebuilding American energy capacity

Beyond its immediate commercial ambitions, Base Power’s approach speaks to a broader transformation in the U.S. energy economy — one that blends software, manufacturing, and local ownership to rebuild resilience from the household level up.

The company’s long-term vision extends beyond residential markets. Executives have indicated interest in expanding to small businesses, microgrids, and community-scale deployments, leveraging the same distributed platform to support energy equity and grid flexibility.

As Lopas put it, “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrialising America and reinventing the grid.”

If successful, Base Power’s model could help redefine how power is produced and consumed in the world’s largest economy — turning homes into active participants in the clean energy transition while strengthening the backbone of U.S. grid infrastructure.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Base-Power-Secures-1B-to-scale-U.S.-Home-Battery-Network.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 14:04:07.051198

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.
“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.
After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.” While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new one contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.
Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.","The Trump administration is eyeing additional major cuts to green energy projects beyond the billions of dollars that it has already halted.

A list that circulated in Washington this week and was reviewed by news outlets including The Hill detailed billions in further projects whose funds could be on the chopping block. It comes on top of $7.6 billion in cuts announced last week and $3.7 billion announced earlier in the year.

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.

“This is evaluations we’ve had ongoing, and we release these periodically. We released some announcements a few months ago, we’ll have many more coming this fall,”Wright recently told CNN on the $7.6 billion in funding cancellations.

“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.

The $7.6 billion included billions under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for “hydrogen hubs” in California and the Pacific Northwest.

After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.”

While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new one contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.

The new list contains cancellations of billions of dollars in investment in hubs for carbon capture and hydrogen energy, as well as cancellations for red states themselves and utilities that operate there and grants for universities.

It was first reported on by Semafor, which said that it was described as a “kill list”. E&E News confirmed the list with seven people familiar with the Energy Department’s internal operations.

Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich said.

“As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people,” he added.

However, the list met much criticism from supporters of such projects.

“DOE is slashing funding to American companies, investors, and communities across the U.S.,” Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director at Clean Air Task Force, said in a written statement.

“Over the last several years, the U.S. has rightly invested in innovative energy projects that have supported economic growth and workforce development, strengthened global leadership, catalyzed additional investment in local economies, while positioning the country to meet rising energy demands and lowering electricity bills for consumers and businesses. Today’s move jeopardizes the investments and benefits that companies and investors have made,” Schneider added.

The blue state list released last week came amid a moment of particularly heightened partisan tensions during the ongoing government shutdown.

White House Office of Management Budget director Russell Vought, who has threatened federal layoffs during the shutdown, tweeted about the project cancellations impacting blue states.

However, the Energy Department’s review of Biden-era projects it may want to cancel has been longstanding.

Wright told Congress in May that the administration was looking to cancel previously funded projects based on a range of criteria, including whether they aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The simple little criteria we’re looking at is [is it] legal? … Is the technology viable? Is the engineering done competently? Is there a market for the thing that’s being built? Is there a financial model that that cofunding is coming in together with the DOE funding so the project can be complete, and does it add to national or economic security? … And is it aligned with this agenda?” he said at the time.

TheTrump administration has also repeatedly sought to put up barriers for other climate-friendly technologies, especially renewable energy.

In particular, the administration slashed billions of dollars in tax credits for renewables and has even tried to cancel prior approvals of offshore wind projects.

Other agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, have also sought to claw back previously appropriated green funds.",https://www.myarklamiss.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/10/GreenEnergyCuts_Frazin_AP_AlexBrandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-10 11:01:49.503780

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said Chicago-area Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus, during a recent news conference.
“Our goal primarily is to give the state tools to address resource adequacy needs, expand clean energy and keep costs low,” Hoffman told lawmakers.
The Illinois Manufacturers Association and Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, which represent the state’s largest power users, particularly take aim at the energy storage provision and a requirement for utilities to submit long-range integrated resource plans (IRPs).","Illinois Democratic leaders and clean energy groups are racing to pass a wide-reaching energy bill this month to insulate consumers from the Trump administration and regional grid operators whom they blame for “an electricity affordability crisis.”

A key provision of the bill would require six gigawatts of grid-scale battery storage over the next decade. It’s a provision that the Illinois Power Agency estimates would produce savings for consumers across the state who saw electricity bills rise sharply over the summer.

The effort to pass the legislation before the Illinois General Assembly wraps up its fall veto session at the end of the month faces pushback from Republicans and large power users. The lobbying push also reflects a growing sense of urgency to take more control over the state’s energy future as prices rise across the regional electric grids that serve Illinois, PJM Interconnection and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO).

Lawmakers pushing for action say they also want to insulate Illinois from swings in federal energy policy under President Donald Trump.

“Thanks to Trump’s chaotic leadership, our clean energy economy and climate are at great risk,” said Chicago-area Rep. Ann Williams, who heads the Illinois Green Caucus, during a recent news conference. “We have to take action here in Illinois.”

A draft version of the 800-page bill introduced last month by Democratic state Rep. Jay Hoffman, goes far beyond batteries. It would bolster renewable energy procurement, create a long-term planning requirement for Illinois utilities, boost utility energy-savings goals and broaden the state’s existing Solar for All program, aiming to boost solar adoption by low-income consumers.

“Our goal primarily is to give the state tools to address resource adequacy needs, expand clean energy and keep costs low,” Hoffman told lawmakers.

Kady McFadden, legislative strategist for the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, a group of dozens of local, state and national environmental and clean energy organizations, said there’s heightened urgency to take action before lawmakers recess on Oct. 30, given the shift in federal policies since the bill was introduced in the spring and outrage from consumers who saw their electricity bills jump in recent months.

As recently as January, the coalition was pushing for passage of a bill dubbed the Clean and Reliable Grid Act during the Legislature’s lame duck session. In a sign of the times, the title of the bill the group was lobbying for took on a new word, “affordability,” by the time the spring session got underway.

“This is, at its core, a ratepayer protection bill,” McFadden said in an interview.

GOP lawmakers and some of the state’s largest electricity users disagree. They argue Illinois’ existing policies enacted in recent years are at the root of the problem and say core provisions of the legislation being considered will only cause electricity bills to rise further.

The Illinois Manufacturers Association and Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers, which represent the state’s largest power users, particularly take aim at the energy storage provision and a requirement for utilities to submit long-range integrated resource plans (IRPs).

“This is a significant rate increase on every consumer in Illinois, whether it’s a homeowner, a school, a church, a retailer or manufacturer,” said the manufacturing association’s CEO, Mark Denzler.

Denzler blames the recent spike in electricity prices on an imbalance between supply and demand in PJM and MISO. The group wants to extend mandatory closure dates for coal- and gas-fired power plants in Illinois, which were part of the state’s landmark 2021 climate law, and to see development of new power plants, transmission and battery storage.

But the group wants grid-scale batteries financed through state-issued bonds, not procured through the Illinois Power Agency (IPA), a state agency formed two decades ago to buy energy on behalf of the state’s investor-owned utilities.

Hammering out a compromise

The IPA said its “conservative” analysis of the provision shows that the 6 GW of storage, estimated to cost $14 billion, would provide net benefits to ratepayers.

Storage developers and clean energy groups contend the provision would work in much the same way as the state’s nuclear program, which, while initially requiring a subsidy to reactors, is now generating bill credits for consumers.

Illinois House and Senate committees conducted hours of hearings on the sprawling bill in recent weeks and negotiations are ongoing to try to hammer out compromises among a wide array of interests ranges from energy developers to environmental groups, labor, industrial energy users and the data center lobby.

While legislation pushed by the clean energy coalition failed to pass during the spring, that was before electricity bills in Illinois surged beginning June 1 to reflect capacity price increases related to auctions held by PJM and MISO.

Prices for power plant capacity in PJM — a key component of consumer electricity bills — rose fivefold on June 1. They’re poised to jump further next summer. In MISO, which covers the central and southern areas of the state, capacity prices during the summer rose by a factor of 20.

In PJM, three quarters of the capacity price increases were driven by demand from data centers in areas like Northern Virginia, which is outstripping the ability to get new generation online, according to the market’s independent monitor, Joe Bowring, who testified at one of the hearings.

Hoffman, the bill’s sponsor, was among those who pointed a finger at the two regional grid operators for contributing to the rise in prices. Jonathan Feipel, executive director of the Illinois Commerce Commission staff, was even more pointed in testimony last week.

“The real price hikes we’ve seen over the summer, I would argue, are a direct result of PJM and MISO kind of mismanaging markets,” Feipel said.

The unhappiness with rising power prices and the role of the grid operators is reflected in another provision in the bill that would have the ICC conduct a study on whether Illinois would be better off creating its own single-state grid operator, like New York or California, compared with being part of two multi-state markets.

Another piece of the bill is based on a proposal by GOP state Sen. Sue Rezin and would lift a moratorium on new large nuclear power plants in Illinois, the state with the nation’s largest existing fleet of reactors.

Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker signed a law in 2023 lifting the ban on nuclear development for projects less than 300 megawatts. The policy was aimed at enabling development of small modular reactors.

Now technology companies are eyeing larger-scale projects, too, as a long-term answer to growing power needs to run AI data centers. Rezin told POLITICO’s E&E News earlier this year that the growing power requirements of companies looking to build projects in her district and elsewhere in Illinois require the expansion of all forms of power generation, including nuclear.

Constellation Energy, which operates nuclear plants in Illinois, backs the proposal. The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, meanwhile, argues that nuclear wouldn’t ease the burden on consumers and said the bill’s focus should be on reducing energy costs and helping the state achieve the goals established in the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.

Illinois’ largest utilities, ComEd and Ameren, said they’re neutral on the bill, though officials from both have been actively involved in hearings.

“This summer’s electric capacity constraints, which led to significant bill increases for our customers, underscore the ongoing energy supply challenge in Illinois,” said Matt Tomc, Ameren Illinois’ vice president of regulatory policy and energy supply.

United States Renewable Energy Market is expected to reach US$ 1,002.13 Gigawatt by 2033 from US$ 429.55 Gigawatt in 2024, with a CAGR of 3.64% from 2025 to 2033.

With continuous growth anticipated across solar, wind, hydro, and developing green technologies, the U.S. renewable energy business is still expanding strongly because to investor interest, technology advancements, and governmental incentives. With significant activity in the West, Midwest, and Northeast, the U.S. renewable energy sector is regionally diversified. Infrastructure, policy support, and resource availability all affect regional growth rates and technological choices.

Over the past ten years, the US renewable energy sector has grown significantly and is now a significant part of the country's energy mix. The sector, which is fueled by federal and state laws, uses a variety of energy sources, including as geothermal, hydroelectric, wind, solar, and biofuels. Businesses at every stage of the value chain, from utilities and financiers to equipment makers and project developers, are actively involved in the national expansion of sustainable energy solutions.

As governments, corporations, and consumers place a higher priority on decarbonization, investments in renewable energy have increased dramatically. Advances in battery storage and smart grid technology are complementing major infrastructure investments like offshore wind projects and utility-scale solar arrays. Renewables are now more competitive with fossil fuels because of the private sector's dedication to clean energy procurement and supportive laws like tax credits and clean energy standards.

With costs continuing to drop and innovation accelerating, the future of the U.S. renewable energy sector is bright. Although there are differences in regional markets, the overall trend indicates that usage is rising across all industries. Integration issues still exist, particularly with regard to energy storage and grid modernization, but continuous research and development is overcoming these obstacles.

The industry's contribution to energy independence, environmental sustainability, and job creation guarantees its ongoing strategic significance. All solar market categories saw this growth, which resulted in a total installed capacity of almost 188 GW across the country. With 22.5 GW of additional capacity, the utility-scale sector was instrumental, and almost 800,000 US residents installed solar systems in their homes.

Before ramping up to 60 GW yearly between 2025 and 2030, the United States intends to add an average of 30 GW of solar capacity annually until 2025. With cumulative solar installed capacity predicted to reach 673 GW by 2034 - enough to power over 100 million homes - this ambitious objective is anticipated to propel the market for solar photovoltaics (PV) to grow quickly.

The Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, which was introduced by Terra-Gen and Mortenson in January 2024, is a noteworthy undertaking that highlights this expansion. 1.9 million First Solar panels, with a solar capacity of 875 megawatts direct current (MWdc) and roughly 3.3 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy storage, are part of this enormous renewable energy project, which covers 4,600 acres. Additionally, it has the biggest interconnection capacity in the US at 1.3 GW.

Key Factors Driving the United States Renewable Energy Market Growth

Support for Policies and Regulatory Incentives

Policies at the federal and state levels are crucial to the growth of renewable energy in the United States. The economics of renewable projects have been greatly enhanced by incentives like the Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC). Long-term risks are decreased and investor confidence is further increased by the Inflation Reduction Act and associated green legislation.

These regulations encourage widespread implementation by reducing up-front expenses while simultaneously offering long-term stability. States are also enacting strict clean energy laws and climate targets, which is accelerating the industry. Financial incentives and clear regulations increase the viability and appeal of renewable energy projects nationwide.

Advancements in Technology and Cost Reduction

One of the main drivers of growth is innovation in renewable technologies. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewables has significantly decreased due to ongoing advancements in solar photovoltaic (PV) efficiency, wind turbine design, and energy storage technologies. A more dependable and responsive energy network is supported by technological developments in battery storage, smart metering, and grid integration.

Because of these advancements, renewable energy sources are becoming more competitive with conventional power sources in terms of scalability and performance. As technology advances, learning curves and economies of scale further reduce costs, facilitating wider deployment and quicker adoption in the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors.

Demand for Clean Energy from Businesses and Consumers

Growing consumer and corporate demand for renewable energy is a result of growing knowledge of sustainability and climate change. Big businesses are using power purchase agreements (PPAs) and green tariffs to source renewable electricity and set aggressive net-zero goals. This business demand stabilizes developers' revenue streams and aids in the financing of new renewable projects.

Residential customers are becoming more interested in community solar initiatives and rooftop solar. Clean energy adoption is being driven by cost savings, energy independence, and environmental concerns, which is driving market growth for both individuals and companies.

Challenges in the United States Renewable Energy Market

Limitations of Grid Infrastructure and Integration:

Outdated grid infrastructure is one of the main issues facing the US renewable energy industry. The intermittent nature of solar and wind electricity is too much for many components of the current electrical infrastructure to handle. The implementation of renewable projects is delayed by transmission congestion, a lack of interconnection capacity, and sluggish new line permitting procedures.

Advanced grid management technology, such as real-time monitoring, forecasting, and storage, are also necessary for integrating large amounts of fluctuating renewable energy. Renewable capacity growth could surpass the system's capacity to handle them effectively if substantial investment is not made in updating the grid.

Complexities of Regulation and Permitting:

Prolonged permitting processes and regulatory obstacles are commonplace for renewable energy projects. Delays and higher project costs may arise from different state and municipal permitting requirements. In particular, utility-scale solar and offshore wind are subject to land-use disputes, stakeholder consultations, and stringent environmental studies.

These administrative obstacles slow down rollout and deter investment. Additionally, developers may experience uncertainty due to uneven alignment between federal and state regulations. Accelerating the transition to renewable energy requires uniform regulatory frameworks and simplified permitting procedures.

With the federal EV tax credit now gone, many models have effectively become $7,500 more expensive overnight, whether bought outright or through the once-reliable lease loophole.

Read: Tesla’s Standard EVs Don’t Even Have A Radio, But Will You Care?

To soften the blow, several manufacturers are getting inventive, introducing aggressive discounts, cheaper trims, and in some cases, cutting slow-selling models altogether.

The end of the tax credit on September 30 led to a significant surge in EV sales across the United States; however, sales are expected to decline through the final quarter of the year. In a bid to try and prop up demand, Hyundai is offering a cash incentive worth up to $11,000 on the 2025 Ioniq 5.

Automakers Get Creative

Both General Motors and Ford have also been looking for ways to encourage shoppers to pick up the keys to one of their models.

For example, GM had been working on a plan for its lending arm to initiate the purchase of EVs at dealership lots and then apply for the $7,500 federal credit, rolling this money into lease terms for customers. However, it recently scrapped these plans, reports Reuters.

Nevertheless, it shows how creative some firms are getting to try and ensure EV sales don’t fall off a cliff. This week, Tesla also introduced lower-priced versions of the Model 3 and Model Y.

While both of these models were in the works before the Trump administration confirmed that the credit would be axed, they may help to convince some shoppers to buy an EV who would have otherwise been priced out of the market.

According to Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, automakers are taking varied approaches to a common problem.

“The overarching message of tax credits going away for EVs has had a very different set of approaches from each automaker,” he told Business Insider. “Which approach will be most successful? Debatable. Nobody’s looking to increase. That’s cuckoo talk at this point. You just want to maintain that basic level of sustainable sales, and this is the different methodologies that each of them have taken.”

Some brands have decided that cutting losses may be the most practical move. Both Stellantis and Acura have opted to discontinue certain EV models altogether. Acura recently confirmed it will pull the plug on its all-electric ZDX SUV, while Stellantis has shelved plans for the RAM 1500 REV.

While Ford Credit will continue to offer 0% financing for 72 months and other incentives for customers purchasing EVs, some manufacturers, including Hyundai and Stellantis, have provided cash incentives to bridge the gap left by the expired credit.

GM canceled its program after Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer active in auto policy, raised concerns. However, Ford has not provided a clear reason for its decision.

Automakers have been working closely with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to develop strategies to sustain EV sales amid the upcoming expiration of the federal credit.

Data center companies are among the largest offtakers of renewable energy worldwide.","According to the think tank’s mid-year electricity report, wind and solar energy met 109 percent of the extra electricity demand. Solar alone accounted for 83 percent of the increase, with several countries setting new solar generation records.

The biggest increases were seen in China, where solar generation grew by 55 percent; the US, which saw a 14 percent increase; the EU, which increased by 12 percent; India, which grew by 5.6 percent; and Brazil, which saw a 3.2 percent uptick. The rest of the world accounted for the remaining nine percent of the total.

Total renewable generation worldwide grew by 363TWh, a 7.7 percent increase, while coal generation fell by 31TWh to 4,896TWh. As a result, renewables’ share of global electricity rose to 34.3 percent from 32.7 percent, while coal’s share fell to 33.1 percent from 34.2 percent.

The growth in renewable generation was mirrored by overall electricity demand, which increased 2.6 percent (+369TWh) in the first half of 2025. Despite the overall increase in electricity demand, emissions fell slightly by 12 megatons of CO2, driven by falls in China and the EU.

The report focused on monthly electricity data from 88 countries, representing 93 percent of global electricity demand, and included estimated changes in the remaining generation.

Despite global growth in renewables, the US market is expected to enter a downturn due to the current administration's growing apathy toward the sector. In a recent report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its projection for US renewable energy growth over the rest of the decade.

The agency had previously anticipated that the US would install around 500GW of additional renewable capacity, mainly from wind and solar, by 2030. That estimate has now been lowered to about 250GW.

However, while the US is expected to see a sharp drop off, overall global renewable capacity is expected to surge by 2030. The IEA’s latest medium-term outlook forecasts an additional 4,600GW of renewable capacity by the end of the decade, driven predominantly by solar PV, which will account for 80 percent of the growth. According to the report, India is on track to become the world’s second-largest renewables growth market after China.

Data center companies are among the largest offtakers of renewable energy worldwide. In 2024, Amazon was recognized as the largest corporate buyer of renewables for the fifth year in a row, citing data compiled by BloombergNEF.

According to the company, it has supported more than 600 wind and solar projects to date. Of those 600, 40 are in countries with high fossil fuel penetration, including Australia, China, Greece, India, Indonesia, Poland, and South Africa, and US states such as Louisiana and Mississippi.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/Amazon_wind_china.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-10-10 08:02:34.851350

Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.
The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.
Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump’s ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices … and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

This time, it’s the hyperscalers and Big Tech who are set to leapfrog utilities as the first major customers for and early adopters of multi-day energy storage (MDS), which can provide dozens of hours of capacity. For data centers, which require 24/7/365 firm power, MDS could be an attractive offer.

“Data centers are looking for as much energy and power as they can get, as quickly as possible,” explained Aric Saunders, the executive vice president of commercialization at ultra-long-duration storage and carbon battery start-up Noon Energy. The company is developing batteries that utilize reversible solid oxide fuel cell technology to convert between electricity and stored chemical energy.

He told pv magazine USA that speed to power has become a critical component of data center development. But, many of the most common solutions have one thing in common, he said: backlogs in shipping or technology development.

While long-duration storage and MDS are still in their (comparatively) early days vis-a-vis lithium-ion batteries, the technologies are scaling fast and are set to “become a viable solution in terms of power, speed and costs.”

“We haven’t had load growth for 20 years,” Saunders said, adding that the current moment is a turning point. Coupled with increasing renewable penetration, the 4-8 hours of storage capacity provided by most lithium storage systems just “isn’t sufficient” to create a satisfactory level of firm power for data centers without also needing diesel generators, which many companies are trying to move away from.

He sees MDS following a similar path to lithium, which evolved from a niche technology into a dominant industry force.

“It’s not necessarily a new technology, but a new application of the technology,” he said. While electric vehicles helped catapult lithium batteries to the spotlight, Saunders believes Big Tech may be the spark that sets off the long-duration boom.

“This is that push to get us off the margins and more mainstream, but it won’t be the final one,” he said. While we’re no longer in the earliest days of long-duration storage, Saunders expects the industry’s growth to be “exponential” in the next few years once the tech reaches bankability.

“There will always be early adopters and that’s where hyperscalers are our best allies,” Saunders added, noting that “utilities will admit it themselves that they’ll never be that first mover.”

Noon is focused more on not only continuing to derisk their tech, but making sure that their current customers, including hyperscalers, understand how it works and the value it can bring them.

“Solar or wind plus a long-duration battery? That’s an onsite power plant,” Saunders said.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2048px-Google_data_center.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 08:01:05.714417

(NYSE: TE) (“T1,” “T1 Energy,” or the “Company”) has made a strategic investment in Talon PV LLC (“Talon”), acquiring a minority equity stake in the developer of a solar cell fab.

T1 is advancing its own solar cell fab, the 5 GW G2_Austin project in Rockdale, Texas. The first phase is expected to come online in the fourth quarter of 2026. Talon is developing a 4.8 GW solar cell plant in Baytown, Texas. Both Texas-based companies plan to utilize advanced manufacturing to produce the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S.

The T1 and Talon projects are examples of American companies investing in American energy, supported by President Trump’s OBBBA and 45x tax credits. The Texas projects are expected to reshore jobs and deliver power to meet rising electrical demand driven by AI, industrialization and residential load growth.

Both projects are expected to meaningfully add domestic manufacturing capacity and produce TOPCon solar cells, the most globally advanced commercially available solar cells in the U.S. TOPCon cells utilize the quantum tunneling technology awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics earlier this week.

Under terms of the deal, T1 has entered into a Simple Agreement for Future Equity (“SAFE”) to acquire an equity stake in Talon. T1 and Talon remain in discussions to potentially deepen the strategic relationship in the future.

“We are excited by the opportunity to invest in another American solar energy project that complements our G2_Austin development,” said Daniel Barcelo, T1’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. “Expanding the output of American solar cells is necessary to support energy security, achieve regulatory compliance and build an American solar industry based on advanced manufacturing and cutting-edge solar technology.”

T1 Energy owns the 5 GW G1_Dallas solar module facility in Wilmer, Texas, and this summer signed a long-term deal with Corning Inc to obtain polysilicon and solar wafers manufactured in Michigan.

“Our partnership with T1 Energy strengthens the foundation of U.S. solar manufacturing. Together, we’re building scalable, non-FEOC supply chains that deliver true domestic content and reinforce America’s energy independence and national security,” said Adam Tesanovich, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Talon.

Talon PV LLC is a privately held U.S. company developing an advanced 4.8 GW TOPCon solar cell manufacturing fab with anticipated commercial availability starting in Q1 2027. The company is majority owned by Eagle Group, a diversified industrial firm with a long-standing commitment to investing in and advancing American energy production.

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.
“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.
After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.” While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new memo contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.
Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.","The Trump administration is eyeing additional major cuts to green energy projects beyond the billions of dollars it has already halted.

A list circulated in Washington this week and reviewed by news outlets including The Hill detailed billions in further projects whose funds could be on the chopping block. It comes on top of $7.6 billion in cuts announced last week and $3.7 billion announced earlier in the year.

While the Energy Department says no final decisions have been made on which additional projects to cut, Secretary Chris Wright has said his department plans to cancel additional funding issued for green projects under the last administration.

“This is evaluations we’ve had ongoing, and we release these periodically. We released some announcements a few months ago, we’ll have many more coming this fall,” Wright recently told CNN on the $7.6 billion in funding cancellations.

“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he added.

The $7.6 billion included billions under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for “hydrogen hubs” in California and the Pacific Northwest.

After that, a list obtained by The Hill details hundreds of additional projects whose “latest status” is listed as “terminate.”

While the cancellations announced last week primarily affect projects in blue states, the new memo contains additional and equivalent projects in red states.

The new list contains cancellations of billions of dollars in investment in hubs for carbon capture and hydrogen energy, as well as cancellations for red states themselves and utilities that operate there and grants for universities.

It was first reported by Semafor, which said that it was described as a “kill list.” E&E News confirmed the list with seven people familiar with the Energy Department’s internal operations.

Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement that final decisions had not been made on further impacted projects.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich said.

“As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people,” he added.

However, the list met much criticism from supporters of such projects.

“DOE is slashing funding to American companies, investors, and communities across the U.S.,” Conrad Schneider, U.S. senior director at Clean Air Task Force, said in a written statement.

“Over the last several years, the U.S. has rightly invested in innovative energy projects that have supported economic growth and workforce development, strengthened global leadership, catalyzed additional investment in local economies, while positioning the country to meet rising energy demands and lowering electricity bills for consumers and businesses. Today’s move jeopardizes the investments and benefits that companies and investors have made,” Schneider added.

The blue state list released last week came amid a moment of particularly heightened partisan tensions during the ongoing government shutdown.

White House Office of Management Budget Director Russell Vought, who has threatened federal layoffs during the shutdown, posted about the project cancellations impacting blue states.

However, the Energy Department’s review of Biden-era projects it may want to cancel has been long-standing.

Wright told Congress in May that the administration was looking to cancel previously funded projects based on a range of criteria, including whether they aligned with the Trump administration’s agenda.

“The simple little criteria we’re looking at is, [is it] legal? … Is the technology viable? Is the engineering done competently? Is there a market for the thing that’s being built? Is there a financial model that that cofunding is coming in together with the DOE funding so the project can be complete, and does it add to national or economic security? … And is it aligned with this agenda?” he said at the time.

TheTrump administration has also repeatedly sought to put up barriers for other climate-friendly technologies, especially renewable energy.

In particular, the administration slashed billions of dollars in tax credits for renewables and has even tried to cancel prior approvals of offshore wind projects.

Other agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, have also sought to claw back previously appropriated green funds.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/10/GreenEnergyCuts_Frazin_AP_AlexBrandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-10 13:08:20.462448

The announcement was made on Thursday in Zurich, at the closing of this year’s congress. The decision acknowledges Hungary’s strong performance and commitment to renewable energy, with the country now ranked among the top five in Europe for geothermal utilization.

The EGC, held every three years, gathers more than 1,200 participants from across the continent, bringing together policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders to discuss innovations, new technologies, and market developments. First organized in 1999, the event last took place in Hungary in 2003 in Szeged. 25 years later, it returns to the country’s capital.

Budapest won the hosting rights against strong competition from five other European cities—Dublin, Glasgow, The Hague, Porto, and Sofia. The decision was made by the European Geothermal Energy Council (EGEC), which oversees the event and represents the continent’s geothermal sector. Hungary’s bid, submitted jointly by the Supervisory Authority for Regulated Activities (SZTFH), the Ministry of Energy, and the Hungarian Mining Association, received the highest possible score. According to the organizers, the unity of Hungary’s geothermal community, the strength of its national energy strategy, and the government’s policy support were decisive factors in securing the win.

Viktor Horváth, Deputy State Secretary for Energy Transition at the Ministry of Energy, said that Hungary aims to make efficient and environmentally friendly geothermal energy a driving force of its green economy. He recalled the creation of the National Geothermal Utilization Concept and Hungary’s leadership role in drafting the EU’s first action plan for accelerating geothermal energy use. Under the Jedlik Ányos Energy Programme, record funding has been allocated to support geothermal expansion. ‘Hungary is not only an excellent choice because of its past achievements but also because of its promising future,’ Horváth said.

Strategic Deputy President of the SZTFH Bence Gonda noted that Hungary’s geothermal strategy—featuring simplified licensing, state-backed risk reduction measures, and stronger cooperation between public, academic, and private sectors—has become a European benchmark. Hosting the congress, he added, will give Budapest and the entire Central European region an opportunity to showcase their expertise and contribute to shaping future energy policy directions.

Hungary currently leads the region with around 1.1 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity. According to the National Geothermal Utilization Concept, developments in the sector could replace more than one billion cubic metres of natural gas by 2035. The reformed regulatory framework and financial incentives are expected to further accelerate growth, with municipal and district heating capacity projected to double and geothermal power generation to increase ten- to twentyfold.

The 2028 congress in Budapest will serve as a platform to present these achievements, strengthen Hungary’s role in Europe’s energy transition, promote domestic companies on international markets, and highlight the accomplishments of Hungarian researchers in the field.",https://www.hungarianconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AFP__20250930__2606657__v1__HighRes__GeothermalAreaHveradalirInKerlingarfjoellMounta-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 08:59:57.528283

The use of mass timber in construction can significantly lower a building's embodied carbon compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete.
A testbed for operational sustainability The facility is designed to prove that sustainability can be integrated without compromising operational efficiency.
“Packages are being delivered with the same reliability our customers expect and we still get to test our sustainability initiatives,"" a statement from Amazon explained.
This project follows other Amazon developments that have used mass timber, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia.","Amazon has developed a mass timber warehouse in Elkhart, Indiana, which will serve as a live testing environment for more than 40 distinct sustainability strategies.

The project could provide a blueprint for integrating sustainable practices into logistics and industrial buildings without disrupting core business operations.

Amazon’s Chief Sustainability Officer Kara Hurst says: “In climate action, we need to move fast. So our teams got creative and asked: ‘What if we created a real-world testing ground for some of the best sustainability initiatives, in one place?’

“That's exactly what we did at DII5, our brand-new mass timber delivery station in Elkhart, Indiana.”

Scalable green building solution

The DII5 facility was constructed primarily from mass timber and designed by ZGF Architects.

It incorporates features such as clerestory windows for natural light, circadian lighting systems and electric vehicle charging stations.

These elements align with Amazon's objective to achieve net-zero operations by 2040. The project demonstrates a large investment in exploring scalable green building solutions.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardisation of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" Daniel Mallory, VP of Global Realty at Amazon, says.

Daniel continues: ""At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing and resilient in a changing climate.

“The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction and operation of our spaces.""

Data gathering for sustainable change

Amazon’s aim is to use the findings from the test centre to scale sustainable projects.

Kara explains: “Buildings account for 40% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and with that in mind we designed DII5 to be a working laboratory with dozens of solutions – from the walls, water and lighting, to the desks where our employees work.

“The data we are gathering will help us determine which technologies and initiatives can be scaled across our global operations.”

Mass timber and embodied carbon

According to Amazon, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"".

The construction utilised Southern Yellow Pine cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels, glulam beams and wood fibre insulation.

The use of mass timber in construction can significantly lower a building's embodied carbon compared to traditional materials like steel and concrete.

Beyond the structure, the site integrates permeable paving, ""lower carbon concrete"", high-efficiency outdoor lighting and a bio-retention pond for managing stormwater.

These site-wide features contribute to a holistic sustainability strategy, addressing water management, energy use and material science.

The building’s clerestory windows, which line the delivery floor, ""bathe the interior in sunshine"", according to Amazon.

A testbed for operational sustainability

The facility is designed to prove that sustainability can be integrated without compromising operational efficiency.

""These solutions can be changemakers - and the beauty of this approach is, it doesn't impact our operations at all.

“Packages are being delivered with the same reliability our customers expect and we still get to test our sustainability initiatives,"" a statement from Amazon explained.

This approach allows for real-world testing of green technologies in a live, high-volume logistics environment.

Daniel says Amazon will track a range of data points.

""We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,"" he says.

""We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

Scaling innovations across existing assets

The insights gained from the Indiana warehouse are not just for future constructions.

The project is intended to generate a catalogue of proven, retrofittable solutions for Amazon's existing portfolio of buildings.

This makes the facility a strategic tool for decarbonising a vast real estate footprint.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio,"" says Daniel.

(TSXV:REVV)(OTCQB:REVVF) (“Revolve” or the “Company“), a North American owner, operator and developer of renewable energy projects, is pleased to announce it has signed a partnership agreement dated October 8, 2025 with an experienced Engineer, Procure and Construct company (the “EPC Partner“) in Mexico to develop and build a new portfolio of distributed generation power solutions for commercial and industrial customers (the “Partnership Agreement“). The EPC Partner has previously developed more than 50 MW of distributed generation solar projects and brings valuable expertise to the partnership.

Under the Partnership Agreement, Revolve and the EPC Partner have agreed to target two initial portfolios of commercial projects totalling more than 5 megawatts (“MW”) of capacity (the “Target Projects“). The partnership is a key element of Revolve’s broader mandate to increase the size of the Company’s operating asset portfolio in Mexico by partnering with EPC groups that have access to pipelines of late stage, investment ready distributed generation projects that deliver innovative power solutions.

“This is a watershed partnership for Revolve as we join forces with a new partner to advance this portfolio of distributed generation projects in Mexico,” said COO, Omar Bojorquez. “The aim of the partnership, and others we are pursuing, is to accelerate the development and deployment of commercial power solutions throughout Mexico. This partnership has the potential to accelerate our distributed generation pipeline and bring a meaningful number of projects to us for assessment and execution.”

Following the signing of power purchase agreements of any of the Target Projects, the Company intends to own and operate the projects and will provide financial forecasts once definitive agreements are signed. The Partnership consists of a 70% ownership interest for Revolve and 30% for the EPC Partner, with economic benefits being shared on a pro-rata basis on anything over and above Revolve’s required rate of return. The EPC Partner will contribute project opportunities and construction services to the partnership and Revolve will provide project finance and operating expertise, with the economics determined on a project-by-project basis.

With the growing regulatory certainty in Mexico and a lack of investment in the electricity network over the last number of years companies are increasingly focusing on reducing their energy costs and improving energy resiliency. Mexico’s distributed generation market increased by 32% in 2024, reaching 4.4 gigawatts (“GW”) from 3.4 GW, primarily driven by solar installations, according to BNamericas. This growth is occurring as companies seek on-site power solutions and decarbonization to alleviate strain on the national power grid. With a history of operating in Mexico since 2012, Revolve is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth.

“As part of the agreement, the EPC Partner will originate, develop and construct projects and Revolve will finance, own and operate them under long-term power purchase agreements with commercial customers. We are confident this partnership will result in additional distributed generation opportunities for Revolve fueled by increasing electricity demand growth from data centers, electrification and industrial onshoring,” concluded Bojorquez.

While 15 percent of plastic waste is collected for recycling, only nine percent is actually recycled.","The UN's environment chief insists that a landmark global treaty tackling plastic pollution remains achievable, despite talks twice imploding without agreement, and the chair suddenly resigning this week.

United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen told AFP in an exclusive interview that countries were not walking away, regardless of their sharp differences on combating the ever-growing problem, including in the oceans.

A large bloc wants bold action such as curbing plastic production, while a smaller clutch of oil-producing states wants to focus more narrowly on waste management.

Supposedly final talks in South Korea in 2024 ended without a deal -- and a resumed effort in Geneva in August likewise collapsed.

Countries voiced anger and despair as the talks unravelled, but said they nonetheless wanted future negotiations.

""We left with greater clarity. And no-one has left the table,"" said Andersen.

""No-one has walked away and said, 'this is just too hopeless, we're giving up'. No-one. And all of that, I take courage from.""

- 'Totally doable' -

The plastic pollution problem is so ubiquitous that microplastics have been found on the highest mountain peaks, in the deepest ocean trench and scattered throughout almost every part of the human body.

More than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.

While 15 percent of plastic waste is collected for recycling, only nine percent is actually recycled.

Nearly half, or 46 percent, ends up in landfills, while 17 percent is incinerated and 22 percent is mismanaged and becomes litter.

Annual production of fossil fuel-based plastics is set to triple by 2060.

As things stand, there is no timetable for when further talks might be held, and no countries have made formal offers to host them.

But Andersen ""absolutely"" thinks a deal is within reach.

""This is totally doable. We just need to keep at it,"" she said.

- Red line clarity -

UNEP has been shepherding the talks process, which began in 2022.

Summarising where countries are at, Andersen said: ""The mood music is: 'we're still in the negotiations. We are not walking away. We have our red lines, but we have a better understanding of the others' red lines. And we still want this'.""

Andersen said Norway and Kenya convened a well-attended meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York last month.

The COP30 climate summit in Brazil in November will provide another opportunity to put the feelers out, ahead of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi in December.

Luis Vayas Valdivieso, Ecuador's ambassador to Britain who chaired the last three of six negotiation rounds, has announced he is stepping down, leaving the process rudderless.

- 'Serious allegation' -

Vayas's Geneva draft treaty text was instantly ripped apart by countries in brutal fashion, and while a revised effort gained some traction, the clock ran out.

British newspaper The Guardian reported that staff from Andersen's UNEP team held a covert meeting on the last night in Geneva, aimed at coaxing members of civil society groups into pressuring Vayas to quit.

""This is a very, very serious allegation,"" Andersen said.

""I did not know and obviously had not asked anyone to do something of this sort.""

She said the allegation had been referred to the UN's Office of Internal Oversight Services.

""I've been in this business for 40 years, and I have never, ever done such a thing, and I would never have asked a staff of mine, or anyone else for that matter, to go and have covert meetings and quote my name and ask to undo a seated chair who is elected by member states. It's outrageous.""

As for whether a new chair could provide fresh momentum, she said: ""As always, when there's change, there is a degree of a different mood.""

With the conclusion of construction, the facility is now positioned to accelerate North American battery supply.

The plant was built on schedule and without major incidents, according to company leadership. Moreover, the joint venture emphasized safety and thorough execution in each phase. With this milestone, the project now transitions into the commissioning and operational stages.

Project Factsheet: NextStar / ANC Battery Plant

Developer / Partners NextStar Energy (Stellantis + LG Energy Solution)

Project Type Large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing

Capacity approximately 49.5 GWh annually

Size approx. 4.23 million sq ft of facility footprint

Location Windsor, Ontario, Canada

Construction Duration Began August 2022, Completed September 2025

Workforce 3,200 trades & installation staff

Economic Impact Thousands of jobs; major boost to local EV supply chain

Strategic Significance & Market Context

With this plant complete, Canada secures its first large-scale domestic EV battery manufacturing facility. Indeed, NextStar’s facility will supply around 40 % of Stellantis’s electric vehicle needs in North America.

Furthermore, the project supports the auto industry’s shift toward electrification. As more automakers plan EV lineups, stable local battery supply reduces reliance on distant overseas sources. Hence, NextStar’s plant strengthens resilience in North American supply chains, much like the Louisiana EV battery plant that recently broke ground as a first-of-its-kind facility in the United States.

This momentum parallels Texas’ clean energy expansion, particularly through Eolian’s Padua 2 and 3 battery storage projects, which secured $463 million in financing to bolster grid reliability. Together, these initiatives represent a coordinated push to power the future of transportation and energy independence across North America.

Teams, Timing & Execution

Construction of this facility began in August 2022 with site clearing and foundation work. Over succeeding years, the project advanced steadily, marked by topping-out ceremonies and structural milestones.

Project leadership reports that work proceeded with adherence to safety protocols and schedule benchmarks. As a result, the building envelope, mechanical systems, and installation phases were completed on time. Now, the transition is toward testing and startup.

The plant’s workforce included up to 3,200 trades and installers. Of these, a large share were local and Canadian, reinforcing regional industrial capacity.

Challenges & Mitigations

Although the project achieved completion, it faced typical risks: supply chain constraints, labor availability, and cost inflation. To mitigate these, the joint venture applied rigorous procurement protocols and phased staging. In addition, close coordination among Stellantis, LG, and contractors helped streamline operations.

Moreover, contingency planning allowed flexibility in schedule buffers. The project’s success underscores the value of proactive risk management in big-ticket EV infrastructure builds.

Next Steps & Outlook

With construction now done, the plant enters the commissioning and start-up phase. Over coming months, equipment will be tested, systems calibrated, and production ramped. Once operational, the plant will begin delivering modules and cells to EV assembly lines.

The broader implication is clear: this facility positions Windsor, and Canada, as a strategic hub for EV battery manufacturing. As demand for electric vehicles grows, the NextStar plant becomes a cornerstone for regional energy transition and auto growth.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/project-3.avif,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:49.398303

While reporting on the arbitration ruling in an LNG dispute, Venture Global explained that the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) International Court of Arbitration notified its indirect subsidiary, Venture Global Calcasieu Pass (VGCP), on October 8, 2025, about a partial final award issued in arbitration proceedings with BP Gas Marketing regarding LNG sales from the Calcasieu Pass project under the duo’s long-term LNG sales and purchase agreement (SPA).

According to the award issued by the arbitration tribunal, VGCP had breached its obligations to declare COD of the Calcasieu project in a timely manner and act as a “reasonable and prudent operator” pursuant to the SPA, along with certain other obligations.

While remedies will be determined in a separate damages hearing, which has not been scheduled but is anticipated to occur in 2026, BP is seeking damages in excess of $1 billion, among other remedies, as well as interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.

Venture Global highlighted: “The company is disappointed by the arbitration tribunal’s decision in the proceeding with BP, which it believes contradicts the decisive findings in the prior arbitration involving Shell and the facts verified by independent third parties and regulatory agencies with oversight of the Calcasieu project.

“The company is currently evaluating all available options in response to the tribunal’s ruling and will continue to vigorously defend our position. Importantly, the award does not impact the terms of the SPA as entered into and presently performed by the parties, as evidenced by 14 cargos delivered to BP to date from the Calcasieu Project pursuant to the SPA.”

As the final award is expected to follow the damages portion of the hearing, the LNG player does not anticipate that the final award will be subject to the seller’s aggregate liability cap in the SPA, based on the terms of the award issued by the arbitration tribunal.

This follows the win the U.S. firm secured in the arbitration process with Shell over the delay in beginning full commercial operations at the same project.

In the aftermath of the positive decision in the arbitration with Shell, Venture Global Calcasieu Pass claims to have reached another resolution with a post-COD SPA customer related to the arbitration proceeding concerning the Calcasieu Pass facility.

“The settlement has no material impact on the company. This arbitration is now resolved in its entirety. The company remains committed to its long-term contractual relationships and looks forward to continuing to supply this customer with low-cost U.S. liquefied natural gas,” emphasized the U.S. player.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades.
The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said.
The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.","“The end of coal is real, and it is here,” said Catherine Corkery, chapter director for Sierra Club New Hampshire. ​“We’re really excited about the next chapter.”

News of the closure came on the same day the Trump administration announced plans to resuscitate the coal sector by opening millions of acres of federal land to mining operations and investing $625 million in life-extending upgrades for coal plants. The administration had already released a blueprint for rolling back coal-related environmental regulations.

The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.

However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.

Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades. Gradually, though, natural gas — which is cheaper and more efficient — took over the regional market. In 2000, gas-fired plants generated less than 15% of the region’s electricity; last year, they produced more than half.

In recent years, Merrimack operated only a few weeks annually. In 2024, the plant generated just 0.22% of the region’s electricity. It wasn’t making enough money to justify continued operations, observers said.

The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said. ​“The combination of all those factors has meant that coal facilities are no longer economic in this market.”

Granite Shore Power, the plant’s owner, first announced its intention to shutter Merrimack in March 2024, following years of protests and legal wrangling by environmental advocates. The company pledged to cease coal-fired operations by 2028 to settle a lawsuit claiming that the facility was in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.

At the time, the company outlined a proposal to repurpose the 400-acre Merrimack site, just outside Concord, for clean energy projects, taking advantage of existing electric infrastructure to connect a 120-megawatt combined solar and battery storage system to the grid.

It is not yet clear whether changes in federal renewable energy policies will affect this vision. In a statement announcing the Merrimack closure, Granite Shore Power was less specific about its plans than it had been, saying, ​“We continue to consider all opportunities for redevelopment” of the site, but declining to follow up with more detail.

Still, advocates are looking ahead with optimism.

“This is progress — there’s no doubt the math is there,” Corkery said. ​“It is never over until it is over, but I am very hopeful.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-91/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bowmerrimack-1024x7781760087085.jpg?h=7854dcef&itok=VicX6aPv,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:31.996296

The enhanced premium tax credit fight

The enhanced premium tax creditsfirst enacted under the American Rescue Plan and extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Actlower the cost of coverage for the more than 20 million Americans who receive financial help with marketplace plans. By increasing the generosity of subsidies and capping premiums at 8.5 percent of household income for those above the previous eligibility limit of 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), the enhanced tax credits made coverage more affordable for millions of low- and middle-income consumers. Notably, the changes enabled households with incomes from 100 to 150 percent of the FPL to obtain silver plan coverage for $0, which will no longer be the case if the enhanced subsidies expire.

Currently, the enhanced tax credits are set to expire on December 31, 2025, and congressional Republicans declined several opportunities to extend them as part of the Big Beautiful Bill that passed in July. Marketplace insurers priced 2026 plans expecting that the enhanced credits would end, and millions of Americans will face higher premium costs as a result. A KFF analysis found that if the enhanced tax credits expire, average premium costs would more than double for 20 million Americans; and the Center for American Progress previously estimated that average premium costs would spike by 300 percent in some states. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that letting the enhanced tax credits expire would increase the number of uninsured Americans by about 4 million by 2034.

2026 sticker shock is already here

To date, state-based marketplaces in Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Nevada, New York, and Virginia have opened their window-shopping tools for 2026. These tools allow consumers to preview plan options and premium prices before open enrollment begins on November 1. The early sticker shock offers a glimpse of what will soon become reality for millions more Americans with marketplace coverage, unless Congress acts to extend the enhanced tax credits.

Premium increases depend on individual household characteristics and plan selections, but examples using state marketplaces' window-shopping tools show how costs will rise for illustrative households who keep the same silver plan from 2025 to 2026:*

Virginia: A 51-year-old and 50-year-old couple from Roanoke with a household income of $85,000 would see their premium cost rise from $602 to $1,410 per montha 134 percent increase.

New York: A family of four in Rockland County with a household income of $105,000 would see their premium cost rise from $1,809 to $3,101 per montha 71 percent increase.

Nevada: A single 61-year-old in Las Vegas earning $68,000 would see their premium cost rise from $505 to $1,179 per montha 133 percent increase.

Elaine Buckberg leads the Driving Toward Seamless Public EV Charging project at Harvard University.","Concern about public charging is the number one reason people do not buy an electric vehicle.

If all charging providers reported their status live, drivers could easily navigate to working and available chargers.

The Tennessee General Assembly should require open real-time data.

Not long ago, when my husband and I moved from Detroit to Boston, we drove the 600 miles twice in electric vehicles. A short road trip by American standards turned into a frustrating validation of our range anxiety.

The reason: a lack of data.

While Tim concentrated on the highway, my job as passenger was to cross-reference charger apps. One app would plan a route with supposedly optimized charging stops, but it often didn’t tell me if the chargers were working. So I would try looking up each one on the charging provider’s proprietary websites − a time-consuming effort that would be dangerous for anyone driving solo.

This frustrating status quo is holding back EV sales and costing American jobs. Many charging providers do not share live data about their equipment − basic stuff, like whether it’s working or broken. This discourages prospective EV drivers: Concern about public charging is the number one reason people do not buy an EV, according to J.D. Power surveys. Publishing this data is a way to spur EV adoption.

State can require sharing of real-time charging data

Tennessee can lead the way with a straightforward fix − and it will cost the state next to nothing.

If all chargers reported their status live so that any mapping app could include this basic information, drivers could easily navigate to working and available chargers. Were this data available, the chargers’ status would appear in your favorite map app, much like Google Maps shows if a restaurant is open. That would go a long way toward eliminating range anxiety.

Moreover, by shining a light on broken chargers, operators will fix them faster, enabling EV drivers to trust what their phones tell them.

My team’s research estimates that making real-time data universal for highway fast chargers would raise the EV share of new vehicle sales by 6 percentage points in 2030 − to about 46% − under current policies. As a result, there would be 3.5 million more EVs on the road by 2030.

Opening data will help Ford and VW keep hiring in Tennessee

That means jobs, including in Tennessee. Ford’s BlueOval City plant in Stanton is scheduled to begin making batteries this year and EVs in 2027, employing 6,000 Tennesseans. Volkswagen builds EVs in Chattanooga, where it employs 6,000 workers. When Congress ended EV tax rebates with the One Big Beautiful Bill, it threatened those jobs. Open data, by increasing EV adoption, will help Ford and VW keep hiring.

Charging operators may object, saying that their data is available in their proprietary apps, has commercial value, and they don’t want to provide too much information to their competitors.

Yet those very operators would benefit if this data helped the EV market take off faster. With 3.5 million more EVs on the road in 2030, operators will enjoy a market that is 9% larger. That means more charging sessions, enabling them to pay off their investments faster.

If charging providers don’t start voluntarily posting the real-time status of their fast chargers, the Tennessee General Assembly should require open real-time data. Massachusetts has done so, and the California Electricity Commission is proposing the same.

My team and I have just published model legislation that can help Tennessee adopt such common-sense policies.

Making a road trip in an EV shouldn’t be hard. And it doesn’t have to be. If charging providers open access to their data, expect to see many more EVs on the road.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.
Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades.

News of the closure came on the same day the Trump administration announced plans to resuscitate the coal sector by opening millions of acres of federal land to mining operations and investing $625 million in life-extending upgrades for coal plants. The administration had already released a blueprint for rolling back coal-related environmental regulations.

The announcement was the latest offensive in the administration’s pro-coal agenda. The federal government has twice extended the scheduled closure date of the coal-burning J.H. Campbell plant in Michigan, and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has declared it a mission of the administration to keep coal plants open, saying the facilities are needed to ensure grid reliability and lower prices.

However, the closure in New Hampshire — so far undisputed by the federal government — demonstrates that prolonging operations at some facilities just doesn’t make economic sense for their owners.

“Coal has been incredibly challenged in the New England market for over a decade,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association.

Merrimack Station, a 438-megawatt power plant, came online in the 1960s and provided baseload power to the New England region for decades. Gradually, though, natural gas — which is cheaper and more efficient — took over the regional market. In 2000, gas-fired plants generated less than 15% of the region’s electricity; last year, they produced more than half.

In recent years, Merrimack operated only a few weeks annually. In 2024, the plant generated just 0.22% of the region’s electricity. It wasn’t making enough money to justify continued operations, observers said.

The closure ​“is emblematic of the transition that has been occurring in the generation fleet in New England for many years,” Dolan said. ​“The combination of all those factors has meant that coal facilities are no longer economic in this market.”

Granite Shore Power, the plant’s owner, first announced its intention to shutter Merrimack in March 2024, following years of protests and legal wrangling by environmental advocates. The company pledged to cease coal-fired operations by 2028 to settle a lawsuit claiming that the facility was in violation of the federal Clean Water Act. The agreement included another commitment to shut down the company’s Schiller plant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, by the end of 2025; this smaller plant can burn coal but hasn’t done so since 2020.

At the time, the company outlined a proposal to repurpose the 400-acre Merrimack site, just outside Concord, for clean energy projects, taking advantage of existing electric infrastructure to connect a 120-megawatt combined solar and battery storage system to the grid.

It is not yet clear whether changes in federal renewable energy policies will affect this vision. In a statement announcing the Merrimack closure, Granite Shore Power was less specific about its plans than it had been, saying, ​“We continue to consider all opportunities for redevelopment” of the site, but declining to follow up with more detail.

Still, advocates are looking ahead with optimism.

“This is progress — there’s no doubt the math is there,” Corkery said. ​“It is never over until it is over, but I am very hopeful.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/bowmerrimack-2048x1556.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:37.390321

Landry wants to give hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that promises jobs it may not deliver.","$600 million. That’s the price tag on Gov. Jeff Landry’s massive taxpayer-funded incentive package to lure multinational corporations to our state.

While details are unclear, and we the people were not treated to public disclosure of the spending, this eyewatering giveaway is reported to be one of the largest publicly funded enticements for a single project in our state’s history. This despite the fact that Hyundai Steel — one of the intended corporate beneficiaries — reported nearly $86 billion in profits last year. Hardly the sort of shop that needs an influx of cash from the taxpayers of America’s poorest state.

As usual, Landry trotted out the same old rationale to justify sending taxpayers’ money to giant corporations: A big government giveaway would “create jobs.” Since announcing the project from the White House in March of this year, he has been all over our state touting it as if luring mega-polluters to Louisiana was a new idea with economic promise.

Recently, the whole world learned the truth.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Ellabell, Georgia, where Hyundai has been building an electric vehicle plant, resulted in the arrest of 475 people. More than 300 were South Korean nationals who had been brought in by the company. So much for “job creation” for our communities.

Louisiana is about to see history repeat itself. Only this time, we don’t need to look back any further than when the raid happened. Hyundai has already shown us how it operates in Georgia, and there is no indication that things will be any different here in Louisiana. Landry wants to give hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that promises jobs it may not deliver.

Let’s be clear. Despite the news about Hyundai’s hiring of its own people, our governor is still ready to roll out the red carpet. He has not uttered a word since the raid revealed the truth about employment at Hyundai. Louisiana cannot afford another company that sells us a dream of prosperity while leaving us with pollution and broken promises.

In Georgia, construction of the plant was not even complete and already the company was bringing in labor from overseas. We can expect the same in Ascension Parish.

We hear the same story every time a corporation wants to build here in Louisiana, whether it’s a plastics plant, a pipeline or an ammonia facility. The only things discussed are the so-called benefits, while the costs — more wasted tax dollars, more pollution, more sickness — are never mentioned.

Just think of all the ways our taxpayer funds could be reinvested here at home, creating jobs and raising the quality of life for all Louisiana residents. Our state ranks 46th in opportunity, 48th in infrastructure and 50th in economics overall, according to U.S. News and World report. With $600 million in investment, we could build the infrastructure and provide the influx of working capital that entrepreneurs need to make it here in Louisiana and create jobs all along the way. From education and the arts to professional services, health care and more, there are so many services Louisiana residents need. Each presents an opportunity for growth.

If we want that future, we have to make it. We must stand up and pay attention right now. We cannot let the news releases, ribbon-cuttings and positive coverage fool us. We will always be promised new jobs and quick returns on investment when our hard-earned money is sent to another corporate interest, but we can’t let that distract us from the reality that our money will be sunk into someone else’s project. They’ll keep the profits. We’ll be left with the mess.

So what can we do? That part is simple. We can call on Landry to end this wasteful spending today. He needs to hear from every Louisiana taxpayer at his Baton Rouge mansion. Our message is simple common sense: If you have $600 million to spend on economic development, spend it on the Louisiana businesses that commit to staying in our state and creating real jobs for Louisiana residents.

We’re not asking for much. Governor, are you listening?",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/8b/a8bf4410-7072-50f8-9497-961d9953ad45/68a610a701572.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-10-10 06:59:59.711562

POLITICO: Johnson unaware his district risks losing $500M for carbon removal

Republican lawmakers from Louisiana and Texas on Wednesday shrugged off news reports that their states could together lose $1 billion in federal funds for megaprojects that could suck carbon dioxide from the sky.

Two direct air capture hubs being planned for the Gulf Coast of Texas and western Louisiana would be capable of removing 1 million metric tons of climate pollution from the atmosphere annually and storing it underground.

That’s the equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly three gas-fired power plants, according to EPA data, and would make the hubs the largest carbon removal projects on the planet.

The hubs were funded through a $3.5 billion direct air capture program created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and are being developed by Occidental Petroleum and a consortium led by the scientific nonprofit Battelle.

The fate of the projects was thrown into doubt on Tuesday when their awards were included in an unconfirmed Department of Energy cancellation list that made the rounds in Congress and on K Street.

But the leaked document appears to have not made it to the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose economically challenged Louisiana congressional district would be home to Battelle’s Project Cypress.

“I haven’t seen it yet,” he told POLITICO’s E&E News when asked about the list of proposed DOE funding cuts. Johnson added that he hadn’t spoken to Energy Secretary Chris Wright about the status of the hub award…

Johnson’s response echoed his comments in May, when the president’s budget request first called for zeroing out “Green New Scam funds committed to … removing carbon dioxide from the air.” Four days after the White House released that proposal, Johnson told E&E News that “I haven’t had a chance to look at that yet, so I can’t comment on it.”

The median household income of Johnson’s district was just over $59,176 in 2023, according to the Census Bureau. That was more than 26 percent below the national average of $80,610.

Across the Capitol, Texas Sen. John Cornyn (R) also told E&E News he had not seen the list.

“We can talk after I look at it,” said Cornyn, who is running for reelection against more conservative primary challengers.

The rumored cancellations come more than a week into a funding fight that has shuttered vast swaths of the federal government. The Trump administration confirmed plans to cancel nearly $7.6 billion of clean energy projects, including almost half of DOE’s other direct air capture hub awards.

Direct air capture plants generally use carbon-absorbing materials, fans, electricity, heat, and piping to pull carbon dioxide from the sky and store it permanently underground.

To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists have determined that the world would need to deploy direct air capture and other carbon removal technologies at a massive scale by mid-century while also slashing the use of oil, gas and coal.",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:00:42.811917

Greg Abbott signed a law in June that empowers the state’s grid operator to remotely disconnect data centers and other large energy users if the grid is under extreme stress. The so-called “kill switch” is just one aspect of the wide-ranging state legislation meant to govern the growing number of energy-intensive supercomputer warehouses being planned and built out across the state.

The legislation comes as Texas, like other states across the country, tries to balance remaining an attractive place to do business for the booming data center industry while addressing the challenges that come with the huge amounts of electricity the facilities demand, especially when grid capacity has been maxed out by extreme summer heat or freezing winter storms.

Much of the legislation around energy and the grid in recent years has aimed to prevent a rerun of Winter Storm Uri in 2021. During the dayslong freeze, millions of households went without power and at least 246 people died, while some industrial sites’ lights stayed on.

The new law, Senate Bill 6, which currently applies to electricity customers using at least 75 megawatts—equivalent to a medium-sized power plant—aims to shift transmission costs to the large load users, so upgrades and new connection costs aren’t paid through residential and small commercial customer rates.

The legislation also looks to establish grid reliability protection measures and add credibility to electricity demand forecasting.

As with other aspects of Senate Bill 6, the Public Utility of Commission of Texas (PUC), the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and other stakeholders are still working out how the new responsibilities and rules around data centers will be implemented. Public comment periods for stakeholders on S.B. 6 rulemaking close this month.

Both the energy and data center industries are expected to participate in and follow the rulemaking closely, as the two sectors have grown accustomed to the free trade of energy with few state-imposed restrictions.

As the bill made its way through the legislative process, both industries warned that the new oversight measures, requirements to shoulder costs relating to grid reliability and disclose private power deals, could discourage business in Texas.

Attorneys for Crusoe Energy Systems, the artificial intelligence infrastructure company behind the massive Stargate Project in Abilene, said in a state filing that it would be unfair for ERCOT to introduce another approval requirement for private power agreements between Stargate’s users and its power suppliers when they had no time to plan for it. It would subject project developers who have invested billions and have obligations to meet certain timelines to a 180-day delay, the attorneys wrote. The Stargate proposal, involving OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, is set to become the largest data center project in the world.

Crusoe’s attorneys are also seeking a definition of a new large load user from the PUC — asking whether those already in the interconnection queue with planned co-located generation will be subject to the new rules.

The large load interconnection queue faced by ERCOT, Texas’ power grid, is now dominated by data centers, according to data from ERCOT’s latest system planning and weatherization update. Compared to September 2024, ERCOT is now tracking more than three times as many large load interconnections, with nearly 69 percent of 189 gigawatts of large load requests coming from data centers. By contrast, in May 2024, non-cryptocurrency data centers made up less than half of the large power demand requests.

The large load requests in the ERCOT queue—189 gigawatts—equal about 40 percent of the nation’s estimated electricity consumption for 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

With such eye-popping growth, there’s been suspicion that the figures are artificially high. A possible explanation for why that is: Grid operators and utilities have complained that developers are pitching duplicative interconnection requests to multiple sites in or outside of Texas as they wait to see where a green light first appears for developments that may never materialize. This complicates load forecasting and infrastructure planning.

Also, a 2023 law change required ERCOT to include all prospective large-scale power users in demand projections without fully vetting each project. Before that, ERCOT did not count projects in early stages of development until specific financial commitments were made.

S.B. 6 seeks to address unserious large-load projects bloating the queue by imposing proof of financial commitments, including an interconnection studies fee of at least $100,000 and proof that a developer actually controls a proposed site.

But trying to nail down numbers about how much investment is required to be considered in grid planning will be tough, said Doug Lewin, a Texas energy consultant.

“What demonstrates significant commitment?” Lewin asked. “That’s a huge question.”

One firm, Schaper Energy Consulting, whose clients account for more than nine gigawatts of large load projects in ERCOT, suggested in a comment filed to the PUC that the interconnection study fee should be between $150,000 and $300,000, site control be either ownership, an executed lease or an exclusive option to purchase or lease the land, and an interim security requirement of $3,000 per megawatt of requested capacity.

For Woody Rickerson, chief operating officer of ERCOT, the new rules outlined in S.B. 6 are exemplary of why Texas is an opportune place for the growth of data centers, particularly those servicing artificial intelligence. Grid operators and regulators want to move quickly, he said at a data center industry conference in San Antonio on Sept. 30.

Rickerson said in recent years, they’ve proven they can transform the grid through the widespread adoption of renewable energy in ERCOT. The state’s independent grid now hosts more solar, wind and batteries than any other state in the country, with operators saying it can grant customers access to large amounts of power without the bureaucracy other grids face.

“We can change. We can adapt,” Rickerson said. “We can put new processes in place more quickly.”

The PUC staff expects to complete rulemaking on various portions of the law’s implementation, such as private agreements between power plants and data centers and what constitutes a significant financial commitment to enter ERCOT’s large load interconnection queue, throughout this year and 2026. Those new rules would determine when and how the grid operator would cut off power to data centers in an emergency and how to manage costs for grid infrastructure upgrades.

S.B. 6 requires the PUC to consider whether its ratemaking practices, in place for more than two decades, are recovering transmission costs from the appropriate customers.

The current system largely incentivizes big customers to save energy during four 15-minute periods each year when capacity on the grid is tight. The amount of electricity they use during these four instances is used to calculate their bill for the following year.

While this method benefits large load users, including San Antonio’s CPS Energy, one of the nation’s largest city-owned utility companies, it exposes the utility’s residential customers to higher net costs and is less fair, attorneys for CPS Energy submitted to the PUC.

The Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance cautioned the commission from shifting costs onto power generators. ERCOT has never asked generators to pay for transmission upgrades, a senior principal at the business alliance wrote, and doing so would undermine the “friendly” interconnection process for the worse, and delay investments in new power plants in Texas.

Rulemaking on this contentious part of the law is expected to continue until December 2026. Utility commission staff weighed in at a September meeting on whether limiting such considerations to customers using 75 megawatts or more is a good idea. The law gives the PUC authority to lower the threshold if the commissioners see fit.

Some analysts asked whether adopting the 75 megawatt standard would inadvertently create a gap and simultaneously incentivize loads to develop just below that threshold to avoid meeting financial obligations. Jessie Horn, an attorney for the PUC, said the staff suggested eliciting comments from projects above 25 megawatts might be the right number to get comprehensive feedback from across the industry regarding the rulemaking of S.B. 6.

But given that comment deadlines with stakeholders are due this month, the expectation for the initial year is to use the 75 megawatt threshold and revisit the figure later. PUC Chairman Thomas Gleeson said he’s most comfortable with the 75 megawatt threshold until the rulemaking is finalized, meaning only customers who need that much power or more would be subject to disconnection during extreme weather.

ERCOT can instruct utilities and large load customers to curtail operations or switch to on-site backup generators during an energy emergency when the grid is trying to shed demand. S.B. 6 also empowers ERCOT to install technology or necessary equipment to curtail the load before non-critical customers, such as data centers, are interconnected to the grid.

An industrial customer applies for and is awarded a “critical” classification when an interruption of their electric service would create a dangerous or life-threatening condition at their site.

Data center developers and industry members lobbied during the legislative session to make the kill-switch concept more palatable for facility operators by requiring a 24-hour notice before ERCOT could turn off their grid power. The PUC plans to have a proposal on how to implement this part of the rule in February.

S.B. 6 could address some of the issues ERCOT and its users encountered during Winter Storm Uri, said Chris Crosby, the CEO of Compass Datacenters, a design and construction firm for huge, “hyperscale” data centers and cloud providers. The legislation formalizes planned emergency events on the grid and addresses critical scenarios that may span a few hours each year, he said.

While Crosby sees the new legislation as positive, he knows that data center developers across the industry have mixed opinions about S.B. 6., including the Data Center Coalition, the industry’s leading lobbying group.

“While the final product did not fully address all our key concerns, the Data Center Coalition is appreciative that changes made to Senate Bill 6 during the legislative process intend to balance the need to support economic development with efforts to ensure the continued stability of the Texas electricity grid,” said Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, in a statement to Inside Climate News.

The industry group plans to continue working with regulators and grid operators to ensure S.B. 6 is properly implemented and outlines efficient processes, Diorio said. There’s still concern about the uncertainty S.B. 6 imposes on projects already in the pipeline in Texas and on data centers that host digital infrastructure for health care, emergency services, security and banking, which could be disconnected.

Crusoe Energy Systems, the artificial intelligence infrastructure system company behind the massive Stargate Project in Abilene, submitted a comment to the PUC seeking a definition of a new large load user, and asking whether those already in the interconnection queue with planned co-located generation will be subject to the new rules. The Stargate proposal, involving OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, would become the largest data center project in the world.

Attorneys for Crusoe Energy Systems Inc. said in a state filing that it would be unfair for ERCOT to introduce another approval requirement for private power agreements between Stargate’s users and its power suppliers when they had no opportunity to plan for it. It would subject project developers who have invested billions and have obligations to meet certain timelines to a 180-day delay, the attorneys wrote.

The legislation also creates new rules around co-located power generation at data center sites. Large load users often look to locate their projects near a power plant or develop their own gas-fired plants to lower transmission costs and secure a dedicated power supply.

There had been prior thinking that emissions-free energy sources like wind, solar and battery growth would power this new generation of digital infrastructure. But that vision isn’t panning out as speed and around-the-clock, dispatchable power take precedence. As developers rush to get online and ensure power reliability beyond the grid, concerns about powering data centers with renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprints have fallen in priority.

Under S.B. 6, any new, private agreement between an existing standalone power plant connected to the grid and a new large load customer of 75 megawatts or more, must notify ERCOT and undergo a study and obtain PUC approval. The grid operator has 120 days to evaluate the grid impacts and submit the study to the PUC, along with any recommendations. Then the regulatory agency has 60 days to impose conditions on the agreement as necessary to maintain grid reliability and transmission security.

Those conditions could require that, during certain events, data centers with behind-the-meter power would have to reduce load or the generator must make capacity available to ERCOT. It also makes them responsible for stranded transmission assets, or powerlines or substations, that age out earlier than expected or become financially unviable due to customers generating their own power onsite.

Notably, it doesn’t include power plants that were co-located with a large load user at the time they were connected to ERCOT or if the customer is a majority owner of the generating plant. It’s intended to address concerns that data centers are effectively taking capacity from ERCOT through these private agreements.

According to the law, the PUC must require that any dispatchable capacity the power plants sold to ERCOT prior to entering an agreement with a large load user must be made available to ERCOT before an anticipated emergency.

It addresses concerns legislators have expressed that existing generators will sell output to data centers, making that generation unavailable to other customers and adds new regulatory steps for developing data centers in most of Texas.

Maria Faconti, a partner at K&L Gates’ power practice group, said the rulemaking around this aspect of S.B. 6 is top of mind for her clients. Faconti, who works with clients across the energy industry to navigate ERCOT’s regulatory environment, said she’s advised them to submit comments to the PUC.

“I’ve encouraged them to participate, to make sure that, not only are their voices heard, but that how they thought S.B. 6 would be implemented is actually how it ends up being implemented,” Faconti said.

In a submitted comment, Brock Petersen, the chief operating officer of Satoshi Energy, a data center and renewable energy developer, echoed the same concern about the unclear definition of a new large load user. Peterson also wrote that the rules for private power agreements between data center users and developers would disrupt project timelines and compromise investments made under the assumption of regulatory clarity.

With increased demand for electricity driven by larger loads over the past few years, Faconti and her clients knew regulation was inevitable. Before S.B. 6 passed, there were concerns about what the regulatory landscape would look like in a few years. Now, her clients, and their investors, have some clarity.

As part of a push to fortify low-emissions manufacturing in Canada, Quebec province pledged millions of dollars to electrify its school bus fleet in 2022, giving preference to local company Lion Electric.

After the most recent fire, Quebec temporarily pulled 1,200 of the manufacturer's buses from service.

Lion Electric said in a September 12 statement that it was working with Transport Canada to determine the exact cause but confirmed ""neither the electric battery nor the propulsion system was involved"" (archived here).

The company also said the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec approved its plan to return its electric school buses to service.

Transport Canada said in a September 19 statement that a safety defect in the LionC model had not been identified yet ""due to the extent of fire damage in affected buses"" but that the focus is on issues with the low-voltage heating system (archived here).

Montreal fire department spokesman Guy Lapointe told AFP on October 8 that the September 9 fire did not involve the electric bus's battery.

Valerie Tremblay (archived here), sustainable mobility lead for climate non-profit Green Communities Canada, told AFP September 23 that ""electric bus fire incidents deserve attention, but they are rare.""

She said most of the fires seen in the past year were linked either to the HVAC wiring or the heating and defrosting system, components she said operate similarly across electric and traditional combustion buses.

While batteries can malfunction and cause fires, she said electric vehicles were not more at risk than those using diesel and gas, which can also be flammable.

Different challenges

Kate Whitefoot, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University (archived here), cautioned that she had not seen enough evidence to establish that electric vehicles were safer than gas-powered ones, but said she was confident in them having at least similar rates of fire risk.

""And that looks the same across all types of vehicles. So including buses, as well as passenger vehicles,"" she told AFP on September 24, referencing multiple investigations.

AFP located a Chinese study which found electric car fire incidents to be comparable or lower to those in traditional gas-powered vehicles (archived here).

A paper from Sweden also reported a minuscule percentage of the country's electric fleet caught fire between 2018 and 2024, lower than the numbers reported in other types of vehicles (archived here).

The company AutoinsuranceEZ similarly analyzed recall statistics and data from the American National Transportation Safety Board, finding that 25 electric vehicle fires occurred for 100,000 automobiles sold. Meanwhile, hybrid- and gas-powered vehicles burned at rates of 3,475 and 1,530 per 100,000 sales, respectively (archived here).

The National Fire Protection Association, a US-based non-profit, also reports ""there are fewer electric vehicle fires"" but that more research is needed to understand the fire safety challenges unique to electric vehicles (archived here).

Most electric vehicles, including buses, are powered by lithium-ion batteries.

When fires occur, the batteries can enter a state known as thermal runaway (archived here), where the cells overheat. Blazes with a chemical origin can burn much more intensely and be more difficult to put out.

In the case of traditional gas-powered vehicles however, Whitefoot said the risk for conflagration comes into play with the flammable fuel used to power the engine.

Both Whitefoot and Tremblay noted that electric school buses could also be beneficial to students as they reduce exposure to toxic fumes (archived here).

Despite a pause on the country's electric vehicle mandate, Prime Minister Mark Carney's ruling Liberal Party aims to decarbonize Canada's transportation sector for new vehicles by 2035 (archived here).

Opponents of the policy deem the target impractical (archived here) and the scheme has already been a source of misinformation.",https://factcheck.afp.com/sites/default/files/medias/factchecking/g2/2025-10/550f625fd3ce0129af494b7c56e09f6f-en.jpeg,N,,2025-10-10 11:01:36.832504

“Bolt joins the Chevrolet Equinox EV, currently one of the market’s best-selling EVs, solidifying Chevy's position in the affordable EV segment,” GM says.
“Together, Bolt and Equinox EV are expected to account for most of Chevrolet’s 2026 EV volume.” Cassandra states this production strategy makes EV ownership more attainable.
Chevrolet's role in an electric manufacturing future The decision to restart Bolt production was heavily influenced by consumer feedback, directly impacting manufacturing priorities.
This pivot is demonstrated by an EV portfolio that includes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV as well as upcoming models like the Silverado EV and Blazer EV.","Almost 10 years after General Motors initiated production of the Chevrolet Bolt, the mass-market electric vehicle (EV) is scheduled to return to its manufacturing lines.

The Bolt is set for a limited model run in 2026 and according to GM Chief Sustainability Officer Cassandra Garber it is “better than ever”.

The re-release of a popular model points to a strategic manufacturing decision by General Motors to leverage an established product line.

Cassandra says: “To all my sustainability friends who love the Chevy Bolt and have been asking when the next one’s coming — THIS. IS. IT!”

Following a test drive at GM headquarters Cassandra adds: “I had the chance to drive the new Bolt recently at GM headquarters, thanks to my friend Mandi Damman (officially Executive Chief Engineer, but forever the Bolt Queen). “And I can confirm: it’s everything you already love about the Bolt – with some new reasons to fall in love again (or for the first time).”

Scaling production for market accessibility

This announcement arrives as General Motors experiences a period of rapid growth within the US EV market.

Research found that the car manufacturer is on the verge of challenging Tesla’s market share in the US. The reintroduction of the Bolt alongside the Equinox EV could be seen as a strategic manufacturing move to secure a larger portion of the affordable EV segment by increasing production volume.

According to GM the Bolt will offer the longest range in an EV under US$30,000. “Bolt joins the Chevrolet Equinox EV, currently one of the market’s best-selling EVs, solidifying Chevy's position in the affordable EV segment,” GM says.

“Together, Bolt and Equinox EV are expected to account for most of Chevrolet’s 2026 EV volume.”

Cassandra states this production strategy makes EV ownership more attainable. “With the Bolt joining the Equinox EV, one of the market’s best-selling EVs, GM is helping make electric driving truly accessible,” she explains.

Chevrolet's role in an electric manufacturing future

The decision to restart Bolt production was heavily influenced by consumer feedback, directly impacting manufacturing priorities.

Scott Bell, VP, Global Chevrolet, says: “The Chevrolet Bolt was the industry’s first affordable mass-market, long-range EV and it commanded one of GM’s most loyal customer bases thanks to its price, versatility and practicality.

“After production ended, we heard our customer’s feedback and their love for this product. “So the Bolt is coming back – by popular demand and better than ever – for a limited time.”

Chevrolet: a potted history

Founded in 1911 Chevrolet has been a cornerstone of General Motors' manufacturing operations. Headquartered in Detroit Michigan the brand has produced a wide range of vehicles.

Under the leadership of General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Chevrolet is now key in the corporation's strategic transition to an all-electric manufacturing future. This pivot is demonstrated by an EV portfolio that includes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV as well as upcoming models like the Silverado EV and Blazer EV.

The return of the Bolt with its updated manufacturing specifications is a key component of this industrial strategy.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/af31accb711aa5c7709ce667c94f7203:dd9d40ba79977183a2ca8bc155df54a8/cassandrabolt.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 05:59:28.341786

Ford follows in GM’s footsteps, which also said it would extend the lease credit, but then changed its mind.

Ford is backing out of a program that was supposed to extend the $7,500 federal tax credit on new EV leases by the end of the year, as first reported by Reuters.

As a reminder, the tax credit for new electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles ended on September 30, but Ford and General Motors said they would pass along the savings to potential customers by allowing dealers to buy the EVs in their inventory and claim the federal tax credit. Then, the cars would have been leased with the tax credit already factored into the final price.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson told Reuters. Currently, the American automaker’s lending arm, Ford Credit, offers 0% financing for 72 months on new EVs, as well as other incentives, according to the company’s spokesperson.

Earlier this week, GM backed out of a similar solution. It initially wanted to pass on the discount to consumers “at participant dealers, while supplies last,” according to a company spokesperson who confirmed the program last month for InsideEVs. After dropping the support scheme, GM said it will self-fund the lease incentives until the end of October.

Both Ford and General Motors came up with their strategies after discussions with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as reported by Reuters.

GM dropped its program after U.S. Senator Bernie Moreno, who has a luxury car dealership empire in Ohio, sent a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent condemning the actions of “certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.” It’s unclear why Ford canceled its program.

The American EV market is expected to take a big hit after the Trump administration pulled the plug on the $7,500 federal tax credit at the end of last month. Ford CEO Jim Farley said he wouldn’t be surprised if the EV market share goes down from the current level of roughly 10-to-12% to just 5%.

United Cleanup Oak Ridge, an Amentum-led environmental cleanup leader working for the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management, tackled the world’s largest environmental cleanup project.
In this global race for technological supremacy, legacy nuclear sites offer unique strategic advantages that new, undeveloped locations cannot match.
The American Nuclear Society fully supports environmental cleanup of former Manhattan Project nuclear sites as a cornerstone strategy for establishing U.S. energy dominance.
Environmental cleanup of legacy nuclear sites offers the industry its most powerful tool for rapid, cost-effective capacity expansion.","Eighty years after the Trinity Test launched the nuclear age, America is at the precipice of another pivotal moment. As artificial intelligence drives unprecedented energy demands and accelerates the commercial nuclear renaissance, our industry faces a critical question: How do we rapidly deploy the clean-energy capacity our nation needs?

The answer lies not in greenfield development alone but in completing the nuclear cleanup at our legacy sites to position them for reindustrialization. Environmental cleanup of former nuclear facilities isn’t just about addressing the past—it’s about unlocking the future of American energy dominance.

The Oak Ridge model: Cleanup as an economic strategy

The transformation of Oak Ridge’s East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) embodies this principle. The K-25 uranium enrichment facility—once the world’s largest building, spanning 44 acres—became a contaminated liability after operations ceased in 1985. For decades, five massive gaseous diffusion facilities (~100 acres under roof) and hundreds of support structures stood as monuments to environmental challenges and cleanup costs.

United Cleanup Oak Ridge, an Amentum-led environmental cleanup leader working for the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management, tackled the world’s largest environmental cleanup project. Completing this first-ever cleanup of a uranium enrichment complex four years ahead of schedule and $80 million under budget, UCOR achieved something remarkable: the first Manhattan Project “secret city” to fully close its nuclear life-cycle and open the next chapter of advanced nuclear energy and material production.

The economic results speak volumes: ETTP has attracted billions in investment, created hundreds of new jobs, and now hosts dozens of thriving businesses. Most significantly, it has become the home of next-generation nuclear companies including Kairos Power, Orano USA, and X-energy.

At the site that once enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, Kairos Power’s Hermes low-power demonstration reactor is now under construction—the first non–light water reactor permitted in the United States in more than 50 years.

The Tennessee Valley Authority recently signed an agreement to purchase power from Kairos’s Hermes 2 reactor that will also be constructed at ETTP, becoming the first utility to agree to buy power from an advanced reactor. This collaboration, which will deliver 50 MW of reliable 24/7 energy to the TVA grid, will bolster the country’s leadership in advanced nuclear energy.

Adding to the growing momentum, in what state officials say is the largest private investment in Tennessee history, Orano USA’s construction of a $6 billion state-of-the-art uranium enrichment plant in Oak Ridge will help meet future needs for reactor fuel. That facility will be built on 800 acres of federal property, and UCOR has partnered with the state of Tennessee to expedite the land transfer to Orano USA.

Strategic advantages of legacy site redevelopment

In a recent visit to Oak Ridge, Wright defined “Manhattan Project 2.0” as a symbiotic relationship between nuclear energy and AI. In this global race for technological supremacy, legacy nuclear sites offer unique strategic advantages that new, undeveloped locations cannot match.

First, these communities understand nuclear. Host communities that served the nation 80 years ago bring institutional knowledge, workforce expertise, and cultural acceptance that would take decades to develop elsewhere. Oak Ridge’s workforce didn’t just adapt to new nuclear technologies, it embraced them, understanding the national security and economic benefits these projects deliver.

Second, infrastructure matters. Legacy sites retain critical infrastructure elements: electrical grid connections, transportation networks, security systems, and regulatory frameworks developed specifically for nuclear operations. This existing foundation dramatically reduces development timelines and costs, compared with greenfield projects.

Third, environmental cleanup creates immediate dual benefits. Every dollar spent on remediation reduces long-term liability to the American taxpayer while creating developable land. Rather than viewing cleanup as pure cost, the industry should recognize it as investment in future capacity. The Oak Ridge model created by UCOR demonstrates how environmental restoration becomes economic development, turning liability into opportunity.

National security imperatives

America’s leadership in nuclear energy directly correlates to our technological and economic security. China continues with its aggressive nuclear deployment while we debate permitting processes. Russia leverages nuclear exports for geopolitical influence while our legacy sites remain underutilized. The window for maintaining American nuclear leadership is narrowing.

Accelerating cleanup at sites like Hanford, Savannah River, Idaho, Portsmouth, and Paducah isn’t just environmental stewardship—it’s strategic necessity. These locations represent billions of dollars in stranded nuclear infrastructure and expertise. While we invest years in developing new sites, our competitors advance their nuclear capabilities on existing foundations.

The AI boom intensifies this urgency. AI data centers require massive, reliable baseload power that only nuclear energy can provide carbon-free. Tech companies are already partnering with nuclear developers, but project timelines remain the critical constraint. Legacy sites offer the fastest path to deployment, provided we complete necessary environmental work.

The American Nuclear Society fully supports environmental cleanup of former Manhattan Project nuclear sites as a cornerstone strategy for establishing U.S. energy dominance. This position reflects not only environmental responsibility but recognition that these cleanup efforts are essential investments in America’s nuclear future and competitive position in the global energy landscape. As Piercy accurately pointed out in his article, ANS has remained committed to advancing nuclear science and technology for the betterment of humanity.

Industry leaders should champion the Oak Ridge cleanup model nationwide. Other DOE sites from Washington state to South Carolina represent enormous untapped potential for nuclear deployment. Each successful cleanup creates jobs, attracts investment, and demonstrates nuclear energy’s positive community impact.

The nuclear renaissance won’t be built on good intentions alone. It requires practical solutions to real deployment challenges. Environmental cleanup of legacy nuclear sites offers the industry its most powerful tool for rapid, cost-effective capacity expansion.

Oak Ridge transformed from contaminated liability to nuclear innovation hub through bold vision and committed execution by the UCOR workforce. As Wright noted, we’re in a race. The communities that answered the call 80 years ago stand ready to serve again. The question is whether we’ll give them the tools—through accelerated cleanup and strategic investment—to help America win Manhattan Project 2.0.

The future of nuclear energy isn’t just about new technologies. It’s about completing the cleanup of our legacy sites, turning today’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities. In Oak Ridge, we delivered on the vision UCOR has termed “Cleanup Today for a Nuclear Tomorrow.” Across America, our industry can flourish in the same way.

They say the Trump administration‘s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/Solar.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:09:37.538773

The company’s valuation now stands at $4 billion after receiving the new investment, Base Power founder and CEO Zach Dell said.
And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow.
Now Base Power employs 250 people and installs double that rate.
Base Power is already finalizing a location for a ​“much, much larger” facility outside Austin to continue growing its manufacturing capacity.","Investment in cleantech startups is tracking toward the lowest level in years. But Base Power shrugged off the market trends and just raised $1 billion to turbocharge its home battery buildout.

The colossal Series C funding round comes only six months after it raised $200 million in an April Series B. Addition led the latest round, which brought back all previous investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and Valor Equity Partners. The company’s valuation now stands at $4 billion after receiving the new investment, Base Power founder and CEO Zach Dell said.

The pace and scale of those investments put the Austin, Texas–based firm in a league of its own among clean energy startups this year — beating out even the outlandish $863 million that Commonwealth Fusion Systems raised in August. Dell says his company’s traction comes down to a very clear value proposition: It’s potentially the fastest way to expand on-demand grid power at a time when everyone wants more of it.

“Right now, we’re in a capacity crunch — everyone needs capacity,” Dell said. ​“We install capacity faster and cheaper than really anyone out there.”

The U.S. is going through the fastest electricity demand growth in decades, as AI data centers proliferate, more factories open up, and customers purchase electric vehicles. Utilities have long maintained a skeptical stance toward startups’ plans to turn home energy devices into substantial forces on the grid; now, Dell said, they’re not just willing but ​“more excited than ever” to have that conversation.

The key to Base Power’s model is finding households in Texas who want cheap electricity with the benefit of backup power. The company becomes their retail power provider and installs one or two unusually large batteries on-site. Base owns the batteries, and the customers pay an installation fee starting at $695 and a small monthly rate instead of purchasing them for many thousands of dollars. Then the startup aggregates this dispersed fleet of batteries to essentially create miniature power plants it can profit from in the state’s competitive energy market.

The batteries earn money through simple arbitrage: They charge up when wind or solar production pushes prices down and then discharge when demand and prices spike. Base Power also earned certification to deliver ancillary services, which are rapid-fire adjustments to maintain grid reliability, for which batteries are uniquely suited. The company has already maxed out the 20 megawatts it can bid through the Aggregate Distributed Energy Resource pilot, a virtual power plant program, and is pushing for the cap to be raised, Dell said.

Base Power has begun selling its services to regulated utilities so that they can help their customers with backup power and free up more grid capacity. And Dell is scoping out other geographical markets where the rules could allow the Base Power model to grow. But for now, Texas is the ideal place to start. It not only has the competitive market run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, but it is also awash in more utility-scale solar and wind than any other state, enhancing the value of battery-based arbitrage.

When Dell spoke to Canary Media for the previous fund raise, he employed 100 people, and his in-house teams were installing 20 home battery systems per day, for a total of about 10 megawatt-hours in March. Now Base Power employs 250 people and installs double that rate. A year from now, Dell wants to install 100 megawatt-hours per month.

That’s a brash goal for a two-year-old company. But Base Power has actually followed through on its goals, a rare distinction among buzzy cleantech startups. In April, Dell had promised 100 megawatt-hours of cumulative installations by midsummer; he hit that target and is now approaching 150 megawatt-hours.

The firm has also been planning to move from contract manufacturing for its bespoke battery enclosures to in-house manufacturing. In April, Dell said he planned to break ground on a factory near Austin by the end of the year. Now the company has leased the old Austin American-Statesman newspaper headquarters in the heart of town and has begun moving in manufacturing equipment.

“It’s a 90,000-square-foot empty warehouse that happens to be right across the street from our HQ. There’s massive amounts of benefits you get from colocating engineering and manufacturing — having the engineers be really close to the factory, being able to walk the line and make iterations in real time.”

This factory will take imported battery cells and build the modules, packs, and power electronics needed to turn them into large home-battery products. The plan is to start manufacturing in the first quarter of 2026 and ramp up to 4 gigawatt-hours per year of production capacity, Dell said. This supply chain strategy also shores up compliance with new federal rules limiting tax credits for batteries that contain too much content from China.

Base Power is already finalizing a location for a ​“much, much larger” facility outside Austin to continue growing its manufacturing capacity.

Other startups have opted for ​“capital light” strategies to get solar or batteries into the hands of customers. Base Power, in contrast, went capital-heavy, fronting the money to design, own, and install the batteries with the expectation of making future profits on their capacity. It’s too soon to know how that business bet will play out over years, but Dell indicated the early returns were attractive.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Image_Batteries_By_Home.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f1405d8afb488e8e0c204ac842608267,N,,2025-10-10 04:59:03.493072

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-10-10 05:26:15+00:00,News From The States,Could Clearwater become the first Florida city in 20 years to run its own power utility?,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/could-clearwater-become-first-florida-city-20-years-run-its-own-power-utility,"That was the estimate offered by an outside energy consultant hired by Duke Energy of Clearwater’s costs.
They include the big four investor-owned providers — Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities, and Tampa Electric Co. (TECO).
“We know it’s going to be a fight and it’s going to take time,” said Clearwater City Council member David Albritton after the board approved the study.
“Be rational,” suggests former Boulder City Council member Bob Yates, when asked what words of advice he would give Clearwater and St. Petersburg council members who support municipalization efforts.
St. Petersburg City Council member Brandi Gabbard is also enthusiastic about pursuing municipal power.","ST. PETERSBURG — Last Saturday morning in South St. Petersburg’s Wildwood Park, 16 members of a group calling itself “Dump Duke” gathered to share strategy before pairing up to canvass in nearby neighborhoods.

They were there to inform residents and ratepayers frustrated about the prices and services provided by Duke Energy that they could do something about it by signing a petition.

The signature drive was part of a grassroots effort to demonstrate to the City of St. Petersburg legitimate interest within the community to seriously explore jettisoning Duke — their longtime energy provider — when the 30-year franchise agreement between the two parties expires next summer.

“It’s one of the easiest things to canvas for,” said Dump Duke organizer Marley Price, comparing it to her experience knocking on doors last year for an unsuccessful candidate for St. Pete City Council.

“With Duke, everyone knows them. Most people have had a bad experience with them, so it’s really to relate that back and tell them something new — that it doesn’t have to be that way.”

Those and earlier efforts have spurred several members of the City Council to take up the idea. The board voted, 5-3, in August to call on Mayor Ken Welch to seek bids for a feasibility study evaluating the pros and cons of leaving Duke and forming a municipal utility, something that 33 other communities now operate in Florida.

Consultant study

That early vote came as Pinellas County’s next largest city — Clearwater — has received its own, long-anticipated feasibility study prepared by NewGen Strategies & Solutions about what would happen if that city ended its relationship with Duke Energy, whose franchise agreement expires at the end of this year.

Projecting a 30-year period beginning in 2026, the report concluded that if the city dropped Duke Energy, its effective rates over the next five years would end up approximately 7% lower on average than the Duke rate on an annualized basis. After that, the effective rate would run approximately 18% lower on average than the Duke rate for the remainder of the 30-year period.

The study values the cost of acquiring Duke property at $572 million but also notes that the real cost of Duke’s assets could run between 50% lower or 100% higher than its estimate — meaning around $1 billion. That was the estimate offered by an outside energy consultant hired by Duke Energy of Clearwater’s costs.

In Florida, 54 utilities provide electricity to residents. They include the big four investor-owned providers — Duke Energy Florida, Florida Power & Light, Florida Public Utilities, and Tampa Electric Co. (TECO). Those four serve approximately 75% of the state’s population, with the remaining 25% provided by 33 municipal electric utilities and 16 rural electric cooperatives, according to the Florida Municipal Electric Association.

While it would be convenient if an investor-owned utility sold its private assets to a public entity, it never works that way. If Clearwater municipalizes its electric utility, it would have to go the eminent domain route — by far the most expensive option, as Duke officials have been explicit in stressing that they have no intention of selling their system.

“We know it’s going to be a fight and it’s going to take time,” said Clearwater City Council member David Albritton after the board approved the study. “It’s a risk. We all know that. But it could be a lower rate.”

The NextGen study is loaded with caveats, however, including an explicit statement that “there can be no guarantee that Clearwater … will achieve cost savings.”

Winter Park’s success

Some of Florida’s largest communities, such as Orlando, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, have run their own municipal utilities for decades, but not a single one has launched since Winter Park, a northern suburb of Orlando, did so in 2005. That took place following a referendum approved by 69% of the electorate in 2003.

Randy Knight, city manager for Winter Park, described recently on the Florida City and County Management Association podcast how its municipal utility has buried 80% of its power lines underground over the past 20 years, which “has been just huge in reliability … and not having storm outages at all has been fantastic.”

“In this last storm, we had 271 customers out of power after the hurricane came through, and had all of that restored in 12 hours,” he said (the Winter Park municipality serves approximately 15,000 customers). “None of those outages were in the underground part of the system … . It was a testament to what we were doing was the right thing and, you know, the community loves that.”

“As of May, our rates were 32% lower than Duke Energy’s and 2% lower than the statewide average for municipal utilities,” Knight added to WKMG television in August.

Nationally, the last local community to form its own electric utility was the Jefferson County Public Utility District in Washington state in 2013.

Boulder’s decade-long experiment

There is no greater example of how hard it can be to break away from an investor-owned utility than what happened in Boulder, Colorado, which spent nearly a decade trying to break away from Xcel Energy. That effort ended in 2020 when voters approved a settlement with Xcel to trigger the reinstatement of a franchise agreement abandoned a decade earlier.

“Be rational,” suggests former Boulder City Council member Bob Yates, when asked what words of advice he would give Clearwater and St. Petersburg council members who support municipalization efforts. “Be objective and clear-eyed about your evaluation, not only of your goals and objectives, but also how long it will take and how much it will cost.”

In the case of Boulder, taxpayers approved $29 million for the losing effort. Yates says that when investor-owned utilities decide to fight, they won’t give up easily.

Boulder residents pushed the local government to separate from Xcel because of frustration with the lack of urgency the power company expended in pursuing electricity from green power sources like wind and solar.

Yates, who served on the Boulder City Council from 2015 to 2023, said that while he personally never supported the effort, he wishes Pinellas County lawmakers the best of luck. “I don’t think it was a good use of time or money, but the situation may be very different in Florida, so I wouldn’t want to presume to tell the good folks of Florida how to handle their affairs,” he said.

Ursula Schryver is senior vice president for education, training, and events for the American Public Power Association, a D.C. trade group representing the nation’s 2,000 public power utilities. While there is a sense of urgency with the impending end of the franchise agreements in Clearwater and St. Petersburg, it’s generally “a long process and requires a lot of commitment on the part of the community and leadership and so forth,” she said.

The end of a franchise agreement doesn’t mean the end of service

St. Petersburg Mayor Welch, who at one point in his career worked as an accountant with the old Florida Power Corp., has suggested establishing a new 10-year agreement with Duke next year to ensure that residents could rely on “stable and dependable services” as the future of energy in the city is debated. But Schryver says that rather than signing a shorter franchise agreement, “now’s the time” for the city to begin negotiating its wants and needs.

“They have to continue serving the community — Duke or whomever the incumbent is has to continue to serve the community, even without a franchise agreement,” she said. “I would suggest negotiating and continuing to look at the option of forming a public power utility without signing that franchise agreement vs. signing a five-year one and then you’re going to be in the same place that you’re in now, five years down the line.”

That’s what the city of Tampa did during the aughts. After its 20-year franchise agreement with TECO expired in 2006, the city spent two years negotiating with the utility before signing a new 25-year agreement in 2008.

St. Petersburg City Council member Richie Floyd says the fact that the city’s franchise agreement is scheduled to end next year gives the city “a once-in-a-generation opportunity to look into the city’s options.”

“It’s not a radical idea or anything, although I think it’s an important one,” he said.

St. Petersburg City Council member Brandi Gabbard is also enthusiastic about pursuing municipal power.

“What the residents are asking of us is for us to really be able to control costs and to be able to give them a level of service that they are demanding, and so I think that we need to listen to our residents,” she said. “We need to explore it. I’ve been very honest with residents that I don’t have a crystal ball. I don’t know what the future holds.”

Gabbard expressed dissatisfaction that the city hadn’t as of early October even set a timeline for sending out the request for proposals for a consultant study. “There’s no guarantees that this is actually going to come to fruition, but for us to drag our feet and not respond the way that residents are asking us to, I think is doing a disservice.”

Orlando Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani argues that having a local utility through which residents can exercise direct influence “is always preferable to relying on the Public Service Commission as your advocate.”

“Most constituents don’t even know the Public Service Commission exists, but having a local utility board that you can present to, engage with, and really influence leads to better consumer experiences,” she said.

After the Clearwater City Council voted to begin a formal reappraisal of Duke’s distribution system, Duke said in a written statement that creating a city-owned electric utility would be “enormously expensive, risky, and take years to complete.”

“As we have said before, our system is not for sale. That position has not changed. Duke Energy remains committed to serving our Clearwater and St. Petersburg customers, and we look forward to working with both cities on the best path forward — which we believe is renewing the franchise agreement.”

Pinellas County residents are also being hit by social media ads from “We Stand for Energy,” a campaign created by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), calling on them to “Tell the Council: Don’t Waste Taxpayer Money” by pursuing municipalizing.

“As feasibility studies consistently show, municipalization efforts threaten to increase customer costs by billions of dollars without improving service,” said an EEI spokesperson when asked about the campaign. He declined to respond to a question about how much EEI was investing in the effort.

Meanwhile, Dump Duke advocates say they’re not relenting, although Price concedes it’s discouraging that Mayor Welch has declined to meet with the group.

“Hopefully, there will still be enough public pressure still that they have to do something,” she said.

Saturday, as Dump Duke advocate Jason Scott began knocking on doors in South St. Petersburg, he met a man who said that he used to work for Duke as a lineman but now works across the bay for Tampa Electric.

“What’s your opinion of Duke?” Scott asked him.

“It’s a good company to work for, but I understand that a lot of residents were complaining about high bills and stuff,” the man, who did not want to be identified, responded. “I do understand why.”

When Scott asked him about the cost of his monthly bill, the man quickly jumped in.

“Of course I want cheaper bills, but at the same time that Duke kind of monopolizes everything. I don’t see a way to get out of the situation without it being more expensive.”

Nevertheless, he ended up signing Scott’s petition.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-44/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-4-1024x7711760069277.jpeg?h=d1f0e8ce&itok=x9X8d5B0,N,,2025-10-10 08:01:56.108375

That’s according to a new scorecard from a leading environmental group, which gives a North Dakota utility a failing grade.
Todd Leake, executive committee chair with the Sierra Club’s North Dakota chapter, said he doesn’t like recent developments within this sector.
“This is blowing out of the water the whole path that we were taking forward with clean energy generation and retiring the coal plants,” he said.

That’s according to a new scorecard from a leading environmental group, which gives a North Dakota utility a failing grade.

The Sierra Club’s latest “Dirty Truth” report grades 75 utilities across the country based on their plans to retire coal plants, their alternatives for new gas plants and their overall transition to clean energy. It says Basin Electric Power Cooperative is still too reluctant to make a noticeable switch, no matter the pledges it’s made.

Todd Leake, executive committee chair with the Sierra Club’s North Dakota chapter, said he doesn’t like recent developments within this sector.

“This is blowing out of the water the whole path that we were taking forward with clean energy generation and retiring the coal plants,” he said.

For Basin Electric, the report criticizes the utility for securing recent approval of a new large gas plant. Leake worries about similar moves amid the push to build data centers. Basin officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Nationally, the Trump administration is pushing to extend the life of fossil fuel plants scheduled for closure, even with analysts warning about the bigger costs for ratepayers.

Wind energy has gained a stronger footing in North Dakota, and industry experts often argue the power source is more affordable for customers compared to fossil fuel plants. Leake wants to see more scrutiny of data centers, noting their rapid expansion complicates current planning.

“Why this one particular industry has a total carte blanche to go and consume as much electricity as it wants, to the detriment to everyone else,” he said.

Supporters of keeping coal and natural gas as part of the energy mix warn that data centers are pushing electricity demand even higher, and that cleaner sources can’t meet that demand alone. The Sierra Club says this year is the first time the aggregate score for all utilities dropped below the inaugural report.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.minotdailynews.com/images/2016/11/03084632/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:58:45.829102

About ESS Tech, Inc. At ESS (NYSE: GWH), we deliver safe, sustainable, long-duration energy storage to ensure energy abundance and security.
Established in 2011, ESS enables project developers, independent power producers, utilities and other large energy users to deploy reliable, sustainable long-duration energy storage solutions.","Salt River Project (SRP), a not-for-profit public power utility serving the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, and ESS (NYSE: GWH), a leading manufacturer of iron flow long duration energy storage (LDES) systems, today announced an agreement to add Project New Horizon, a five megawatt (MW), 50 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery system, to the grid. The pilot project will be installed at SRP’s Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center in Florence, Arizona. ESS will sell capacity to SRP under a ten-year energy storage agreement.

The ESS Iron Flow Battery (IFB) project will be part of SRP’s effort to evaluate emerging, non-lithium ion LDES technologies and support SRP’s reliability and sustainability goals. The system, which will utilize ESS’ Energy Base technology, will store enough energy to power 1,125 average-size homes for 10 hours. This project is the result of an RFP issued by SRP in 2024 for LDES pilots.

SRP is working to at least double the number of generating resources on its power system in the next 10 years to meet increasing energy demand in the Phoenix metropolitan area. SRP has nearly 1,300 MW of energy storage currently supporting its grid, which includes 1,100 MW of battery storage— spanning eight facilities— and 200 MW of pumped hydro storage.

“As the Valley continues to see rapid commercial and residential growth, projects like this allow us to better understand the efficacy and impact of different kinds of LDES technologies as they mature,” said Chico Hunter, SRP Manager of Innovation and Development. “This is another opportunity for SRP to evaluate the real-world performance of emergent technologies on our grid and in the Arizona climate.”

ESS’ technology uses a combination consisting mainly of iron, salt and water to store and discharge energy. The Energy Base will be designed to deliver 10 hours of discharge with “fast charging” of 10 hours or less. ESS’s products are safe and sustainable with no risk of thermal runaway, operate in a wide range of temperature environments and are Made in America with over 90% domestic content. They further offer a competitive levelized storage cost with a 25-year life expectancy.

“SRP once again demonstrates its leadership with its commitment to non-lithium, long duration energy storage,” said Kelly Goodman, Interim Chief Executive Officer of ESS. “This project is a significant validation in both the LDES industry and ESS as a technology provider. We are thrilled to be working with SRP to deliver more hours of clean energy to its customers.”

The Copper Crossing Energy and Research Center currently includes a 99-MW flexible natural gas facility. A 55-MW utility scale solar project is currently under construction at the site. The site will also host CMBlu Energy's “Desert Blume”, a 5 MW, 10-hour LDES project.

ESS will be partnering with industry leaders to deliver the project by December of 2027. Design is already underway, and manufacturing will begin in 2026. SRP and ESS will work with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to monitor performance data of the project.

North Omaha State Sens.
Both said energy rates might rise, partly due to unregulated data centers requiring more power or other power demands, but not because of the North Omaha Station plan.
Combined, OPPD has said those facilities would produce 600 megawatts, more than all of the units operating now in North Omaha.
Most questions were for Williams and sought more information about the North Omaha plant transition, Spivey said.","LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers sued the Omaha Public Power District on Thursday, seeking to stop a plan to retire three of five power-producing units at the utility’s North Omaha Station and switch the other two coal-fired units to natural gas.

The 46-page lawsuit, filed in Douglas County District Court, seeks to stop the changes planned for the North Omaha Station, as well as prevent OPPD from pursuing any policy that prioritizes considerations other than price or reliability, including “environmental justice.” Residents had fought to get OPPD to modify the plant, citing health concerns.

Hilgers said data doesn’t support the assertion that the plant harms neighbors’ health.

In a midday announcement, he said he wants to focus the publicly owned utility on what he says state law requires: reliability and affordability. He said OPPD’s plan for the North Omaha plant would retire 240 megawatts of electricity production as OPPD sees skyrocketing increases in demand. Though the local power district’s plan says moving forward is contingent on opening new power-generation facilities this year, Hilgers said the changes wouldn’t add power capacity and would only help OPPD “tread water.”

“We should not be taking one electron off the grid,” Hilgers said.

OPPD declined to comment because of pending litigation. Multiple board members could not be reached for comment.

Targeted in the lawsuit are OPPD, its CEO and president and six of eight elected OPPD directors. It was not immediately clear why board members John Hudson and Michael Cavanaugh are not named in the lawsuit. One of the elected members, Sara Howard, served with Hilgers in the Legislature, where she chaired the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee.

North Omaha State Sens. Ashlei Spivey and Terrell McKinney said they adamantly disagree with Hilgers’ decision. Both said energy rates might rise, partly due to unregulated data centers requiring more power or other power demands, but not because of the North Omaha Station plan.

Spivey, a member of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, called the lawsuit a “witch hunt” she said is meant to “strong-arm” OPPD into following state leaders’ political whims.

“We have seen the AG’s Office do that a number of times on a number of divisive political issues,” Spivey said. “It’s a waste of taxpayer dollars.”

‘Delays are at an end’

In 2014 and 2016, OPPD directors agreed to a plan that, by 2023, OPPD would retire the three North Omaha units in operation since the 1950s and switch the other two in operation since the 1960s from coal to natural gas. The oldest three units switched to natural gas in 2016.

The plan was delayed in 2022 and then made contingent upon the construction of two new power-producing stations: Standing Bear Lake and Turtle Creek. Combined, OPPD has said those facilities would produce 600 megawatts, more than all of the units operating now in North Omaha.

The timing could be tied to OPPD, which appears ready to move forward with the North Omaha Station plan during a “procedural” meeting next week, Spivey said.

Hilgers, too, said he feels “the delays are at an end” and that’s part of why the lawsuit came now. He said it takes a lot of work to decommission power plants, a process he said is also hard to unwind.

Supply and demand

Part of the AG’s concern comes as OPPD hopes to achieve a greener-energy goal of “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, a plan the utility board approved in 2019. OPPD leaders are balancing the desire to meet that goal, which was set when demand for electricity was fairly flat, with rapid recent increases in consumer demand for power.

“Ultimately, it is a supply and demand issue,” Hilgers said. “It would defy reality and economics to suggest that taking 200-plus megawatts offline, given this demand environment we’re in, will do anything other than increase the cost to [OPPD] ratepayers.”

On health concerns, Hilgers said he checked the air quality in North Omaha on his phone just hours before his afternoon event. The quality was at 29, he said, on a metric that considers any number under 50 “great.” He said he’s not dismissing air quality as a concern, nor is he saying local control doesn’t matter.

However, Hilgers argued that taking energy production offline would undermine the utility’s key legal guideposts of affordability and reliability. He argued OPPD directors elevated “environmental justice” as equally or more important in violation of a 1963 Nebraska law that the state “provide for dependable electric service at the lowest practical cost.”

Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.

Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen was among those praising Hilgers on Thursday, calling it “foolish” for any power district to avoid coal, a resource he called “the single most affordable means of energy production known to mankind.” He pointed to coal reserves in neighboring Wyoming as a plus and said coal production is cleaner today than before, with “science is on our side.”

“Foreign adversaries have sped up their own coal production, most notably China and Russia,” Pillen said in a statement. “It is unfathomable why we would take any action that would slow or stop our own expansion of coal-driven energy.”

OPPD serves about 1 million Nebraskans, Hilgers said, in a service area that spans 13 eastern Nebraska counties, including much of the Omaha area.

‘Stop acting like a dictator’

The two North Omaha state senators said they see a different health reality on the ground, including on Wednesday, when they hosted a town hall with OPPD Director Eric Williams, whose district includes North Omaha. Most questions were for Williams and sought more information about the North Omaha plant transition, Spivey said.

McKinney said his constituents have faced respiratory problems, with Spivey noting her oldest son has asthma and that the concerns impact whether her constituents can achieve the “good life.” McKinney said a daycare owner close to the power plant annually cleans residue left behind, and McKinney argued state leaders “only care about dollars and cents.”

“It’s time for Hilgers to stop acting like a dictator and let our public power utilities do their job: providing affordable, reliable and clean energy for the people who actually own it,” McKinney said.

McKinney said that to say coal isn’t harmful is “ignorant, to say the least.” McKinney said that if Hilgers is focused on affordability and reliability, “he should build a coal plant in his backyard and let it burn on his property and see how he feels.”

Hilgers said there are “plenty of avenues” for the public to work with OPPD and find solutions without shutting down an “enormous amount of power.” Spivey said the community has already worked with OPPD for the solution at hand.

‘True cost’ of ‘net-zero?’

Part of Hilgers’ lawsuit relies upon and cites information gathered this summer and fall as part of Legislative Resolution 234, an interim study from freshman State Sen. Jared Storm of David City and 19 other lawmakers into the “true cost” of “net-zero” carbon emissions plans.

Storm could not be reached for comment Thursday.

The Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee hosted a Sept. 5 hearing on Storm’s LR 234, in which State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln accused Storm and his cosponsors — including five of Conrad’s fellow committee members — of each being a “climate denier or a climate skeptic.”

Storm told Conrad he knows the climate is constantly changing and that his resolution was about keeping power affordable and maintaining jobs and the community. He wanted an “off-ramp” for consumers. His resolution could hint at legislation for the 2026 legislative session.

“I’m all for green energy, if it can stay affordable, reliable and doesn’t sacrifice Nebraska jobs,” Storm told Conrad.

State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, the Natural Resources Committee chair who was among those signing onto Storm’s resolution, reached out to OPPD and three other utilities in July in preparation for LR 234. Brandt specifically asked OPPD about its North Omaha plans.

OPPD CEO and President Javier Fernandez told Brandt that while OPPD’s system is forecasted to be reliable under federal and regional regulations, “it is reasonable to say the system would have more margin and better reliability/resiliency had the assets [at North Omaha Station] remained in service with applicable maintenance and life extension work.”

One of the tables Fernandez provided Brandt suggests, based on current OPPD plans, that the agency could hit a wall by 2028 and have consumer demand outpace supply. This includes plans by 2029 to bring on 900 new megawatts in natural gas production. Fernandez indicated OPPD is looking to address the “unprecedented load growth” but faces execution and timing challenges with permitting, supply chains, workforce availability and regulatory approvals.

Hilgers, echoing those challenges, said there is a “world of difference” between planning and what actually will happen with any additional new plants or contracted power coming online.

‘Not in the best interests’

The lawsuit posits that maintaining the status quo in North Omaha could reduce or stabilize OPPD consumer rates for power even as demand increases.

In response to another Brandt question as part of the interim study, Fernandez said delaying the plans by five years could net savings of $36 million with potential revenue growth, or $439 million if delayed by 15 years. He testified in September that keeping the status quo would make for better affordability and enable economic growth for consumers, though “slower progress” toward “net-zero.”

In an Oct. 1 email on additional questions from Storm, Fernandez said the North Omaha Station plan was “primarily based on environmental considerations.”

Brandt repeated that he is unaware of any study or data showing health concerns because of the North Omaha energy production. Fernandez told Storm he had no scientific evidence to the same and that emissions are strictly regulated at the state and federal levels.

While Pillen defended coal production, Hilgers said he might be more open to an alternative, such as moving all of the North Omaha units to natural gas but keeping all five operational. Hilgers said he hopes OPPD comes to the table and that he is open to ideas and a possible settlement.

Brandt, reached Thursday, said: “In a time when the state needs all the generation it can possibly get, it is not in the best interests of the utilities and the state to shut down generation.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/north-omaha-station-cropped1760069976.jpg?h=f21521f5&itok=UFU5l1K2,N,,2025-10-10 09:03:47.737543

Holtec said the move would allow it to work with other states that are more amenable.

The New Mexico project was cast aside despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling in August that rebooted plans for a temporary storage in Texas and New Mexico.

The U.S. is at an impasse over a permanent solution for storing spend nuclear fuel, as roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, pile up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.

U.S. nuclear regulators in 2023 licensed the proposed multibillion-dollar storage complex in New Mexico, while opposition persisted.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the Legislature put up stiff resistance with legislation that threatened to withhold local permits and a lawsuit by the state. By contrast, Lujan Grisham’s Republican predecessor, Susana Martinez, had been supportive.

Critics of the project, including the Sierra Club, said Holtec’s decision highlights an enduring roadblock.

“The DOE’s decision regarding the grant doesn’t change our trajectory,” Ascend President and CEO Linh Austin says in a statement. “We’re moving forward.”

Austin notes the company already is producing recycled lithium carbonate at commercial scale at its Base 1 facility in Covington, Georgia, with a purity of more than 99 percent, and is scaling output in the U.S. and Europe toward approximately 15,000 metric tons annually by 2027.

He adds that the company’s funding path is diversified beyond the DOE.

“We are replacing the remaining unused portion of the DOE grant with a mix of other sources of funding available to the company, including equity, project finance, municipal bonds and other forms of debt,” Austin says.

Ascend was included in a recently announced wave of DOE funding cuts totaling $7.5 billion. In all, 321 financial awards were terminated for 223 projects. Awards were issued by the Biden administration via the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Fossil Energy (FE).

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the department says in an Oct. 2 announcement of the cuts.

According to Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the department has reviewed billions of dollars in financial awards, “many rushed through the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Of the 321 terminated awards, the DOE claims 26 percent were awarded between election day in November and inauguration day in January. Affected award recipients have 30 days to appeal a termination decision, and the DOE says some of those recipients already have begun that process.

Headquartered in Westborough, Massachusetts, Ascend was awarded the DOE grant in October 2022 and broke ground on its 140-acre Hopkinsville site soon after. At the time, the company said it planned to invest close to $1 billion in the project, claiming Apex 1 would be the largest electric vehicle (EV) battery recycling and engineered materials manufacturing facility in the U.S.

The sprawling campus was initially expected to create 400 full-time jobs—making it the single largest investment in Western Kentucky—and produce enough cathode active material (CAM) and precursor cathode active material (pCAM) to power 250,000 EVs per year, though that trajectory has changed somewhat over the past year. Materials the company specializes in developing include lithium carbonate, nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate and manganese sulfate from black mass.

“While construction at Apex 1 is paused, we will restart beginning in 2026, with both lithium extraction and pCAM lines aligned with commercial offtakes,” Austin says in his statement regarding the DOE funding cut. “Our business economics are not predicated on grants, but by customer demand, operational excellence and our patented Hydro-to-Cathode technology.”

Construction of the Apex 1 campus has been on hold since late 2024. In April, the company told area media outlets that changing market conditions led to several major customers requesting to push back the start of the facility’s pCAM deliveries by 12 to 18 months, prompting the pause. At a Hopkinsville City Council meeting the same month, Plant Manager Mark Fern said construction would resume once the facility’s design phase is completed.

In February, Ascend came to a mutual agreement with the DOE to cancel a $164 million grant intended to fund CAM manufacturing infrastructure at Apex 1, citing changing market conditions that caused demand for domestic pCAM to exceed demand for CAM. Going forward, the company said it would focus on producing only pCAM and lithium carbonate in Hopkinsville.

“By voluntarily returning the CAM grant, we are freeing up $164 million of federal funding for the current administration to reallocate as it deems most appropriate,” Ascend Vice President of Government Affairs Roger Lin said at the time, adding that the Apex 1 project “squarely aligns” with the Trump administration’s goal of increasing domestic production of critical materials. “We are committed to creating good jobs in Kentucky, providing a domestic supply of lithium-ion battery materials and enhancing U.S. energy independence.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/10/09/ascend_apex1_rendering-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:58:53.354443

Fleming, a distinguished museum leader, historian, husband, father and mentor to many in the museum profession, passed away on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. He was 81 years old. He had lived in Yellow Springs for 35 years. Dr. Fleming was well known as a pre-eminent scholar, academician and author whose life’s work was the preservation and interpretation of African American history and culture.

His career was firmly rooted in the historic black community as he came of age. A native of Morganton, North Carolina, he received his bachelor’s degree from Berea College and in the 1960s served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Malawi, East Africa, where he was assigned to the Ministry of Agriculture. After his return to the United States, he worked for Pride Inc. under Marion Barry and as a program analyst for the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.

Dr. Fleming went on to pursue advanced degrees, earning both a master’s degree and a doctorate in American history from Howard University in Washington, D.C. While serving as a Senior Fellow at Howard’s Institute for the Study of Educational Policy, he wrote two books on African American education: “The Lengthening Shadow of Slavery” and “The Case for Affirmative Action for Blacks in Higher Education.”

Dr. Fleming’s museum career began in 1980 when he joined the Ohio Historical Society as the Afro-American Museum project director. He was the founding director of the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio, and later became the director and chief operating officer for the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Over the course of his career, he was directly involved in the development of six museums, including the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina; the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, Mississippi; and the National Museum of African American Music, in Nashville, Tennessee, where he served as immediate past director. He also served as director emeritus of the Cincinnati Museum Center and as an adjunct professor in the department of history at the University of Cincinnati.

His leadership extended across several respected historical and cultural organizations. He was president of the Ohio Museums Association, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History and the Association of African American Museums. He was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the commission for the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. He was the immediate past chair of the board for the American Association for State and Local History and was recently appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine to the Ohio Semiquincentennial Commission. Locally, he was an active member of the YS Men’s Association.

Dr. Fleming was also a prolific writer and scholar: He was author of five books and 50 articles throughout his career. In addition to his scholarly works, he published two memoirs: “A Summer Remembered,” about his childhood in North Carolina, and “Mission to Malawi,” about his time in the Peace Corps.

He was a recipient of numerous accolades, including distinguished service awards from the Association of African American Museums, the American Association for State and Local History, the National Peace Corps, Berea College, the Ohio Library Association, and the National Peace Corps. In his honor, the Association of African American Museums named its highest honor the John E. Fleming Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2020, he was named one of the Top Ten African Americans in Dayton, Ohio.

But Dr. Fleming was proudest of the time that he devoted to his family and community. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, a psychologist and writer, of Yellow Springs; and his two daughters, one a lawyer and the other a museum professional who followed in her father’s footsteps as a curator of American art. Dr. Fleming is also survived by two grandsons, a brother, a sister and numerous relatives.

He was a former board member and volunteer for the St. Vincent de Paul Homeless shelter in Dayton. And he was a proud member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and Sigma Pi Phi, known as the Boule.

Award presented at The Battery Show North America in Detroit, Michigan.

[Detroit, MI – October 7, 2025] – Ateios Systems, a pioneer in advanced battery manufacturing, has been named the 2025 Battery Manufacturer of the Year at The Battery Show North America, held October 6–9 at Huntington Place in Detroit, MI. The award recognizes companies advancing innovation, performance, and sustainability across the global battery industry.

The honor highlights Ateios’ breakthrough RaiCure™ electron-curing platform, which delivers the world’s fastest solvent-free electrode production—achieving industrial speeds while eliminating harmful PFAS chemicals and dramatically reducing energy use.

Rajan Kumar, CEO and Founder of Ateios Systems, said:

Technology becomes truly profound not through complexity, but through ubiquity, when it is so abundant and effortless to produce that it feels as accessible as air,

“This award shows we are getting closer to that reality. It is an incredible honor for our team, whose belief in our mission continues to drive constant improvement across the company, product, and vision. I am extremely proud of how we have validated performance at scale while uniting production, supply chain, and sustainability in one cohesive solution.”

Transforming Battery Manufacturing

RaiCure™ replaces traditional, solvent-heavy coating methods with a rapid electron-curing process inspired by semiconductor manufacturing. The platform enables industrial throughput with near-zero emissions and drop-in compatibility for existing production lines.

Key technology advantages:

Record-speed manufacturing – 80 meters per minute, nearly 3× faster than the conventional 30 m/min process

PFAS-free and solvent-free – Eliminating toxic “forever chemicals” and reducing energy use by up to 96%

High-energy electrodes – Thick cathodes up to >5 mAh/cm² with yields exceeding 95%

Domestic supply chain integration – All raw materials are sourced from domestic suppliers that can compete on performance, price, and volume in a global market

Scalable deployment – Drop-in solution that can bring immediate returns and faster time to market development of batteries

In September, Ateios announced a partnership with Kodak, leveraging Kodak’s decades of precision film-coating expertise to accelerate the commercialization of its RaiCure™ platform. The collaboration combines Kodak’s 130 years of proven manufacturing infrastructure with Ateios’ clean, solvent-free process to deliver high-performance, U.S.-made electrodes at GWh scale.

Together, the companies are demonstrating how legacy American engineering, next-generation materials science, and strategic investments made by taxpayers can bring real returns in domestic energy independence and drive a cleaner, more resilient battery supply chain.

Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.
The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue.
A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump’s ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices … and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

These cuts will risk more than 1,000 good-paying jobs and harm economic growth in regions across the state, with an estimated statewide economic hit of $650 million. With the cancellation of these projects, communities will suffer and families will go without paychecks, including those in the very districts whose Congressional representatives continue to greenlight reckless cuts out of Washington.

“Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York’s economy and hard-working families are paying the price,” Governor Hochul said. “These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress.

Empire State Development President, CEO, and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “These federal cuts are shutting down projects already underway, and will stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good paying jobs. Communities that were on the brink of transformative growth will now face stalled investments and lost paychecks, as New York’s progress toward a sustainable future stalls. Governor Hochul continues to stand up and speak out for New Yorkers, and the businesses looking to drive economic growth in the 21st century.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “These federal funding cuts put thousands of good-paying jobs at risk while harming the momentum of New York’s clean energy industry by creating further uncertainty for the organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow here. Once again, short-sighted political games at the federal level will undermine innovation and progress in one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy.”

Senator Charles Schumer said, “Donald Trump’s rash actions will hike energy costs for New Yorkers and waste hundreds of millions in investment by wiping out projects already underway in his reckless campaign of chaos & revenge. This goes beyond targeting blue states. It is taking a wrecking ball to working families’ lives from Jamestown to Rockland County, putting countless construction workers out of jobs and raising families’ electric bills just to score petty political points. NY House Republicans’ silence — as Trump rips away billions of sound investment and thousands of good-paying jobs from their backyard — is deafening. Instead of playing politics with the shutdown, President Trump should be working on bipartisan solutions to lower Americans’ costs, boost diverse energy supply, and create jobs.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Clean energy is the way of the future for a healthier and more affordable New York State. These Trump administration cuts will have devastating consequences for New Yorkers’ quality of life, the state’s economy, and the overall wellbeing of our communities. I am deeply disappointed in my Republican colleagues who are turning their backs to their constituents by supporting these funding cuts.”

Representative Jerrold Nadler said, “Trump has brazenly cut half a billion dollars in clean energy funding, and my Republican colleagues lack the spine to stand up to him. We will not let Donald Trump’s personal campaign of retribution against our city and state continue down this reckless path. This careless decision will have detrimental consequences; if New York’s economy gets hit, the entire country will feel it, thousands of good paying jobs will be lost, and hard-working families will go without paychecks. These cuts must be reversed immediately, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on Trump to give New York our already approved funding back.”

Representative Nydia M. Velázquez said, “These cuts are a direct attack on New Yorkers and our clean energy future. These grants create good jobs, grow our economy, and move our state toward sustainability. Stripping away this funding threatens workers in my district and across the state and undermines the progress our communities have fought to achieve. New York Republicans need to stand with their constituents instead of standing by while this administration puts New Yorkers’ livelihoods on the line.”

Representative Yvette D. Clarke said, “At a time when Trump’s devastating cuts risk undermining the economic stability of communities across New York, our neighbors statewide are pleading with their Republican representatives to stand up for them, their families, and their futures – but they’ve heard nothing back but betrayal. New York Republicans are running out of time to figure out if they serve the people who put them in Congress, or the corrupt president who will toss them aside the instant they’re no longer useful. I stand with Governor Hochul and the people of our state in demanding my Republican colleagues make the right choice by, at long last, putting New York first.”

Representative Grace Meng said, “We should always be working to promote jobs and economic growth in our state and that includes New York’s clean energy sector. I have spoken out against cuts made by the administration that harm our local communities, and I will continue to do so. New York deserves to receive all the resources we require.”

Representative Adriano Espaillat said, “From the rising costs of groceries, utilities, and housing, affordability is among the highest concerns facing New Yorkers and their families. Yet, the Trump administration has failed to work collaboratively to find solutions that would provide families the much needed relief they deserve. Rather than focusing on solutions to curb these ballooning costs, the administration has canceled critical projects and programs that communities rely on. We will stand firm to combat the administration’s ineffective and dangerous policies that threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of New York families and we will hold them accountable.”

Representative Paul Tonko said, “Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to advance our state’s growing 21st century economy, Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have chosen to unilaterally terminate hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy funding for New York State and our Capital Region. Let’s be clear — these aren’t Democratic or Republican projects. These are cutting-edge programs working to drive innovation and bring energy costs down for everyone. By canceling hundreds of these projects across the nation, Donald Trump and his enablers are showing that they care more about their own power than about making life affordable or delivering good-paying jobs for the American people. It’s time for my Republican colleagues to stand up to this bullying behavior and advocate for the best interests of our communities.”

Representative Joe Morelle said, “At the direction of Donald Trump, Congressional Republicans chose to shut down the government rather than negotiate with Democrats—and New Yorkers are paying the price. These cancelled grants—including over $75 million destined for the Rochester region—will hurt businesses and families across our great state. As Vice Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’m working with my colleagues to stand up to Donald Trump and secure the federal investments New Yorkers deserve.”

Representative Dan Goldman said, “Donald Trump’s reckless and shortsighted clean energy cuts are nothing short of partisan warfare against New Yorkers. After kicking over a million New Yorkers off their health care, Trump and his New York Republican allies like Elise Stefanik and Mike Lawler are now yanking away half a billion dollars in clean energy funding as punishment for a shutdown they caused. They’re putting politics over paychecks and jeopardizing thousands of good-paying union jobs in communities across our state. Once again, New York Republicans in Congress would rather serve Trump’s political agenda than stand up for their own constituents.”

Representative Tim Kennedy said, “Canceling these shovel-ready projects will kill jobs, stifle innovation, and raise costs for working families. These projects would have lowered energy costs and strengthened our grid during severe weather. Instead, Trump and Congressional Republicans have again sided with special interests over their own constituents, making it harder for families to pay their bills and for America to lead in the industries of the future. Western New Yorkers should be building the technologies that power the next generation, not watching those opportunities disappear because of Republicans in Washington.”

Representative John W. Mannion said, “This administration thinks research and innovation only matter in the states they won in an election. They’re wrong. These reckless cuts are job killers that hurt families across New York. They also sell out our future, hand an advantage to China, and will drive up energy costs for everyone. This funding should be restored immediately – and I’m advocating to restore it in congressional districts represented by either party, because that’s what’s good and right for all New Yorkers and all Americans.”

Representative Josh Riley said, “Families and small businesses in the Hudson Valley and Southern Tier are already getting squeezed by sky-high utility bills — and now this administration wants to make it even harder to keep the lights on. These cuts will only make life more expensive for working people. I’ve fought utility monopolies and their outrageous rate hikes, and I’ll keep fighting to restore funding and lower costs for Upstate New Yorkers.”

Assemblymember Al Stirpe said, “The ongoing attack from the current federal administration on anything that promotes clean energy continues unabated. Any disruption in already approved funding for these programs threatens the potential for new, high-paying jobs, stifles economic growth, and stagnates significant progress towards greener alternatives. As Chairman of the State Assembly Economic Development Committee, it is clear that such cuts do nothing but set New York State’s businesses and communities back – all while hurting real people and working families in the process. Companies that had been planning their next steps forward in the clean energy sector will now be faced with unnecessary hardship or be forced to reconsider critical investments. Without restoring this funding, New York risks falling behind in one of its fastest-growing industries and losing hard-won progress in the clean energy sector.”

Assemblymember Micah Lasher said, “Donald Trump is once again targeting New York’s economy by slashing funding for clean energy, putting thousands of good-paying jobs on the chopping block. Every Republican member of Congress from New York has a lot to answer for. I stand with Governor Hochul in demanding that these cuts be immediately reversed.”

Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy said, “Clean energy investment has been one of the most effective drivers of growth in our state, fostering innovation, strengthening our economy, and positioning us as a leader in sustainability. The withdrawal of these funds threatens to stall that momentum and undermine years of progress. I urge the Trump administration to reconsider this decision and fully restore the funding. Maintaining our commitment to clean energy is not only sound environmental policy, but it is also a vital economic necessity for the Capital Region and New York State as a whole.”

Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz said, “Who is served by these cruel and vicarious cuts supported by New York’s cravenly sycophantic GOP caucus? Did New York Republicans realize that they were electing ‘representatives’ who would gladly vote to crush their local economies, strip away good-paying jobs, and let their communities wither all to pay for tax cuts for billionaires? It’s disturbing that elected officials would so openly and brazenly vote against the best interests of their constituents, but that’s today’s GOP. Their legacy will be one of shame and dishonor, accumulated in the service of a felon. New York deserves far, far better than this group of feckless bootlickers who sell us out for their own benefit.”

City of Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said, “GE Vernova has played a vital role in revitalizing the GE campus through continued innovation in clean energy technologies. However, the proposed federal funding cuts threaten to significantly impede this progress, with far-reaching negative impacts not only on the company’s momentum but also on the broader economic and workforce development efforts across the city and county.”

Amherst Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa said, “Not only do these cuts immediately impact families and businesses, by cutting funding for clean energy development, Washington is taking direct aim at future generations. There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm. Today’s investments are the cornerstone that builds industry of tomorrow. These cuts are reckless and they significantly hurt local communities. I join Governor Hochul in urging our local representatives to immediately restore this vital funding – we need to invest in energy the same as we invest in infrastructure, it is our lifeblood.”

Henrietta Town Supervisor Steve Schultz said, “The need to reduce our environmental impact is reinforced almost every news cycle with violent storms, record high temperatures, shrinking glaciers, and rising sea waters. As with any developing technology, it can have difficulty competing with established solutions. This is where a responsible government steps in with incentive programs and policies to help level the playing field while those new technologies mature. The United States has a long history of such programs, which has helped the nation not only lead the world in new technologies but become an economic superpower while doing so. The investment in these new technologies pays dividends in the long term. Plug Power, Inc, in Henrietta, is an example of this, creating clean energy equipment for use in industrial and commercial settings. Dramatic cuts, especially those of a retaliatory or vindictive nature as we have seen lately out of Washington, will have a lasting negative impact that could take years or decades to recover from.”

Brighton Town Supervisor William Moehle said, “The Trump administration’s attacks on green energy investments are bad for the nation, but they are especially bad for Brighton. $4,969,022 in funding has been cut for one of Brighton’s high technology businesses, Ionomr Innovations, which conducts cutting edge clean technology research here in Brighton. Now more than ever, it is important to fund advances in clean energy technology, and I call on the administration to restore this important research funding for America’s future.”

Albany County Legislature Chairwoman Joanne Cunningham said, “We are resilient in Albany County. Even with nearly $111 million of our taxpayers’ funding not returning to us, we will continue to support our local business community with our state partners and Governor Hochul in particular. Recognizing the uncertainty of federal funding, we are proactively working to advance development in Albany County through our partnership with the State and the Governor on the multi-million-dollar expansion of the Albany Capital Center. We’re also thankful for the $400 million the State is investing in Downtown Albany at her request. With this continued support, we’re confident we can overcome this latest challenge.”

Rensselaer County Legislature Deputy Minority Leader Nina Nichols said, “Governor Hochul stands with the thousands of New Yorkers whose livelihoods are threatened by Washington’s reckless cuts. Slashing $500 million in clean energy grants doesn’t just stall progress—it risks over 1,000 good-paying jobs and delivers a $650 million blow to our economy. These communities deserve investment, not abandonment.”",,N,,2025-10-10 03:57:38.683732

Similarly, renewable diesel imports tumbled to 5,000 b/d from 33,000 b/d a year earlier.
Blenders pivot to domestic supply Facing tighter margins and the adjusted tax credit framework, fuel blenders have increasingly turned to domestic biofuel production over imports.
The company has historically supplied all the renewable diesel imports to the US.
Looking ahead, the EIA forecasts net US biodiesel imports in 2025 and 2026 to remain at their lowest levels since 2012.","In the first half of 2025, US imports of biodiesel and renewable diesel plunged to their lowest levels in more than a decade.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, biodiesel imports averaged just 2,000 barrels per day, down sharply from 35,000 b/d in 1H 2024. Similarly, renewable diesel imports tumbled to 5,000 b/d from 33,000 b/d a year earlier.

These are the weakest first-half import numbers since 2012, a period when domestic biofuel use was only a fraction of today’s volumes.

This dramatic drop follows a major tax-credit policy shift. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the previous $1/gallon blender’s tax credit (BTC), which applied to both imported and domestic biodiesel/renewable diesel, was replaced in 2025 by the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

The main change? 45Z excludes imports.

The removal of import eligibility has undercut the economics of foreign biofuels entering the US market. The change reflects several other US actions that aim to focus on domestic production rather than imports.

Why Imports Fell (and Why Domestic Producers Gained)

1. Tax credits no longer favor imports

Prior to 2025, both domestic and imported biomass-based diesel qualified for the $1/blender’s tax credit. This gave importers a competitive footing alongside US-based production operations.

With the credit now limited to US production under Section 45Z, imported biodiesel and renewable diesel face a structural disadvantage.

2. Weak domestic demand and poor blending margins

Import volumes were also squeezed by lower domestic consumption.

Compared to 1H 2024, US renewable diesel use in 2025 was down ~30%, and biodiesel use was down ~40%. That drop reflects market uncertainty over blending mandates and thin or negative margins on biofuel blends.

3. Blenders pivot to domestic supply

Facing tighter margins and the adjusted tax credit framework, fuel blenders have increasingly turned to domestic biofuel production over imports. This applied even for the reduced volumes they still blend.

The shifted dynamic squeezed out imports further as foreign producers had fewer profitable outlets.

One example of this change in action: Neste. The company has historically supplied all the renewable diesel imports to the US. But in early 2025, Neste sent a smaller share of exports.

Looking ahead, the EIA forecasts net US biodiesel imports in 2025 and 2026 to remain at their lowest levels since 2012.

Implications for Domestic Markets and Policy

Stronger Domestic Biofuel Demand

The tax-credit change shifts value to US producers, potentially spurring new investments in domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel facilities. As imports retreat, the burden of meeting RFS mandates increasingly relies on local capacity.

Feedstock Pressure Intensifies

Greater demand for domestic output means more pressure on feedstock supply (e.g. used cooking oil, animal fats, residues). Regions with abundant low-cost feedstocks may tighten further, fueling competition, price volatility, or supply constraints.

Credit and Compliance Dynamics Shift

RIN markets may see upward pressure if biofuel volumes grow but supply remains constrained. Domestic producers now gain more exclusive access to the Clean Fuel Production Credit, which could enhance profitability for efficient operations.

Importers and Exporters Pivot Strategies

Foreign biofuel producers will likely reroute supply away from the US and toward markets still offering incentives or favorable trade conditions. Some may pursue joint ventures or local US assets to regain eligibility under the new credit scheme.

Lagged Consumption Recovery and Regulatory Risk

As blending demand rebounds later in 2025 (to meet RFS mandates), domestic producers and infrastructure must be ready. Yet regulatory swings or uncertain credit program details could still destabilize market participation.

Key Risks and Wild Cards

Feedstock Bottlenecks: If domestic biofuel plants scale without securing sustainable feedstocks, raw material costs may spike, eroding margins.

Policy Reversals or Litigation: Import restrictions could provoke legal challenges (e.g. from trade groups arguing unfair treatment), or future administrations may reintroduce import credits.

Overcapacity and Margin Pressure: Rapid new builds could create oversupply and compression on margins. This holds especially true within a volatile RIN environment.

What These Changes Will Mean

The 2025 policy pivot didn’t just shift tax credit rules. It has completely reshaped the US biodiesel/renewable diesel trade landscape.

Import volumes have collapsed almost overnight, and the competitive balance now tilts toward domestic producers. For stakeholders across the value chain like feedstock suppliers, refiners, investors, and compliance-focused entities, this shift highlights two critical concerns:

Feedstock Strategy Matters More than Ever

Securing high-quality, sustainable, scalable feedstocks will be a competitive differentiator.

Intelligence and Agility are Essential

With shifting credit rules, variable mandates, and a dynamic supply environment, staying ahead requires real-time market monitoring, scenario modeling, and readiness to pivot as policies evolve.

In short: the tax credit change is not merely a change in incentive. It’s a structural realignment of the US biofuel paradigm. Those who understand and adapt will be better positioned in this next phase of low-carbon fuel markets.

HumeLink East Project Director Carel Nagel said ACCIONA and GenusPlus Group are incredibly proud to be part of the landmark project.
“It is a privilege for our whole team to be part of such a significant project for Australia's energy future.","The delivery of this project will reinforce NSW’s southern electricity grid and enable the integration of more renewable generation into the National Electricity Market (NEM), helping to realise Australia’s transition to cleaner, more affordable energy and meet the Australian Government’s recently announced emissions targets.

Providing a critical backbone to the NEM by reinforcing the southern grid, it will connect at Wagga Wagga with EnergyConnect and form the energy superhighway needed to help bring cheaper, cleaner renewable energy online from solar and wind generators in south-west NSW.

It will also unlock the full capacity of Snowy 2.0, which will provide an additional 2,200 megawatts of on-demand energy into the grid – enough to power up to three million homes for a week.

Transgrid Group CEO, Brett Redman, said the 365km transmission line is expected to deliver more than $1 billion in net benefits to the Australian economy and provide consumers in NSW with better access to cleaner, more affordable electricity.

“This is a pivotal moment for the country’s energy transition as Transgrid and our delivery partners get on with the job of delivering this once-in-a-generation project that will help make Australia’s clean energy transition a reality,” Mr Redman said.

“HumeLink is a major step forward in delivering the sustainable, affordable and reliable energy all Australians deserve. I want to thank the Australian Government and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation for supporting this critical project under the Rewiring the Nation program.

“Nation-building projects such as HumeLink are crucial to helping the Australian Government achieve its new 2035 climate change target of a 62 to 70 per cent reduction in emissions, compared with 2005 levels.

“Transgrid and our delivery partners will continue to work closely with landowners, communities and key stakeholders as construction of the project proceeds. We will also invest in local communities to create jobs, deliver education and training opportunities, support local businesses, improve community facilities and services, and boost local economies.”

Transgrid has now reached negotiated land access and easement agreements, either in place or agreed in principle, with 98.9 percent of private landholders for the HumeLink project.

Bannister grazier Ken Ikin, who runs Cloverlee Poll Hereford Stud, will have the HumeLink project span part of his property, which is near the Gullen Range Wind Farm.

Mr Ikin, who has an existing transmission line on his property, said the tower and transmission line that will be installed on his property will not interfere with his operations and livelihood.

“It's a step forward for the future for our grandchildren and children,” Mr Ikin said.

“The existing line was here the day we came to look at the property.

It's been here for a long time. To put another one alongside and to get paid for it is really, you know, there's a lot of other things to worry about than that.”

In a significant win for regional NSW, HumeLink is expected to create 1,600 construction jobs and deliver $6.3 billion of direct and indirect investment into the regional economy.

Capital Requirements: Developing alternative supply chains requires substantial investment—approximately $15-25 billion over the next decade to meaningfully diversify global rare earth supply chains.
FAQs About China's Rare Earth Export Controls What specific rare earth elements are now under export control?","China's Rare Earth Export Controls: Strategic Implications for Global Supply Chains

China has dramatically expanded its rare earth export restrictions, adding five additional elements and various refining technologies to its controlled list. This strategic move, announced by China's Ministry of Commerce on October 10, 2025, introduces new licensing requirements for holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium exports—elements critical for manufacturing advanced technologies including EVs, wind turbines, semiconductors, and defense systems.

New Restrictions and Their Scope

The latest measures significantly broaden Beijing's control over global rare earth supply chains. The restrictions not only cover the raw materials themselves but extend to refining technologies and, for the first time, impose constraints on foreign producers using Chinese materials or equipment.

These export controls represent a calculated strategic move that leverages China's dominant position in rare earth processing, where it handles more than 90% of global production. The comprehensive nature of these restrictions suggests a deliberate attempt to maintain China's technological advantage while potentially responding to Western export controls in other sectors.

The new compliance measures will take effect on November 8, 2025, with additional regulations for foreign companies beginning December 1, 2025, adding further complexity to already strained global supply chains.

Timeline of China's Tightening Export Controls

China has been systematically expanding its rare earth export control framework:

December 2020: Implementation of Export Control Law establishing the legal foundation for strategic export restrictions

April 2025: Initial export restrictions on seven rare earth elements (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium)

July 2025: Ban on exports of rare earth alloys, magnets, and chemical mixtures

October 2025: Expansion to five additional elements and refining technologies

This progressive tightening demonstrates China's strategic approach to leveraging its resource advantages in response to broader geopolitical tensions.

Why Are Rare Earth Elements Strategically Important?

Critical Applications Across Key Industries

Rare earth elements play an indispensable role in numerous high-technology applications despite being used in relatively small quantities:

Renewable Energy: Permanent magnets containing neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium are essential for wind turbines and electric vehicle motors. A single 3MW wind turbine contains approximately 600kg of rare earth permanent magnets, while electric vehicle motors typically require 1-2kg of these specialized magnets.

Defense Technology: The U.S. Department of Defense identifies rare earths as mission-critical materials. Each F-35 Lightning II fighter jet requires approximately 920 pounds of rare earth materials, while Virginia-class submarines use around 9,200 pounds. Precision-guided weapons, radar systems, and electronic warfare equipment depend heavily on these elements.

Consumer Electronics: A typical smartphone contains approximately eight rare earth elements—lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, gadolinium, terbium, and dysprosium—used in speakers, vibration motors, displays, and glass polishing compounds.

Aerospace: Aircraft engines, navigation systems, and satellite components rely on rare earth elements for their unique magnetic, luminescent, and temperature-resistant properties.

Medical Technology: MRI systems require superconducting magnets containing significant quantities of rare earth elements, particularly gadolinium, which is also used as a contrast agent in approximately 30% of MRI procedures.

China's Dominant Market Position

China's control over the rare earth supply chain has developed over decades through strategic investments in mining, processing capabilities, and technological expertise:

China's Rare Earth Industry Dominance Percentage Global processing capacity >90% Global mining production ~60% Refined rare earth exports ~80% Rare earth magnet manufacturing ~85%

This dominance is particularly pronounced in heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), where China controls over 95% of global supply. While China produces approximately 60-70% of raw rare earth materials, its near-monopoly on processing creates a critical bottleneck in global supply chains.

What Is Driving This Strategic Move?

Geopolitical Context and Timing

The announcement comes at a critical juncture in US-China relations, preceding a scheduled meeting between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. This timing suggests a deliberate strategic calculation by Beijing.

The expansion of rare earth export controls represents a powerful reminder of China's ability to leverage its resource advantages in response to broader geopolitical tensions and trade disputes.

Reciprocal Response to Western Technology Restrictions

China's actions appear to be directly linked to recent Western technology restrictions:

Follows U.S. lawmakers' calls to expand bans on chipmaking equipment exports to China

Responds to the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security's expanded semiconductor export controls, which affect approximately $30-50 billion in annual semiconductor equipment sales to China

Demonstrates China's willingness to use its resource dominance as a countermeasure in the ongoing technology competition

This tit-for-tat approach highlights how resource control has become a key tool in the broader strategic competition between major powers.

Strategic Resource Nationalism

The move aligns with China's broader ""dual circulation"" economic strategy, which emphasizes:

Greater self-reliance in critical supply chains to reduce vulnerability to external disruptions

Maintaining leverage in international markets through controlled export policies

Protecting domestic technological development by ensuring priority access to strategic resources

Securing long-term economic and national security interests through resource control

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) emphasizes this ""dual circulation"" approach, prioritizing domestic consumption and production while maintaining international trade. The strategy aims to reduce dependence on foreign technology while strengthening China's position in global supply chains.

How Are Global Markets Responding?

Immediate Market Reactions

The announcement triggered significant movement in rare earth stocks globally, with particularly strong gains for North American companies:

Critical Metals Corp: +17%

Energy Fuels: +11%

MP Materials: +6%

USA Rare Earth: +6%

These price movements reflect investors' expectations that Western rare earth producers will benefit from higher prices and accelerated investment as consumers seek alternatives to Chinese supply.

Long-Term Market Implications

Market analysts anticipate several long-term effects:

Price Volatility: Historical precedent suggests significant price increases for the newly restricted elements. During previous export restrictions in 2010-2011, neodymium prices surged from $40/kg to over $300/kg within months.

Investment Acceleration: Western governments and private investors are likely to increase funding for rare earth projects outside China. This could compress development timelines for projects that might otherwise take 7-10 years from discovery to production.

Strategic Stockpiling: Countries may expand strategic reserve initiatives of rare earth materials, similar to Japan's program that maintains approximately 60 days of consumption in strategic reserves.

Technology Adaptation: Manufacturers may accelerate research into reduced rare earth usage or alternative materials to mitigate supply risks.

The rare earth market's thin trading volumes and opaque pricing mechanisms make it particularly susceptible to volatility in response to supply chain disruptions, potentially creating both risks and opportunities for investors.

How Could Australian Companies Benefit?

Enhanced Government Support: Australian projects align with both domestic defence-critical materials strategy and U.S.-Australia defense cooperation, potentially unlocking additional support mechanisms.

Long-Term Offtake Agreements: Western manufacturers seeking supply security may offer favorable long-term purchase agreements to support project development.

What Does This Mean for Global Supply Chains?

Supply Chain Bifurcation

Industry analysts describe the move as accelerating a ""structural bifurcation"" of global supply chains:

China focusing on localizing its rare earth and semiconductor value chains to ensure domestic technological development

Western nations racing to build alternative refining and processing capacity through coordinated investment programs

Creation of parallel ecosystems for critical materials based on geopolitical alignment rather than pure economic efficiency

This bifurcation reflects a fundamental shift from globalized, efficiency-focused supply chains toward regionalized, security-oriented networks.

Western Response Strategies

Western nations are implementing multi-faceted approaches to reduce dependency on Chinese rare earth supplies:

Domestic Production Incentives: The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provides production tax credits of 10% for critical minerals and up to 30% for clean energy manufacturing, specifically prioritizing North American and Free Trade Agreement partner sourcing.

Strategic Partnerships: The Minerals Security Partnership (14 nations) and bilateral agreements prioritize supply from democratic allies, accepting potentially higher costs in exchange for supply security.

Technology Development: Western governments are funding alternative processing methods, with the U.S. Department of Energy's ARPA-E program supporting research into rare earth alternatives.

Stockpile Creation: Japan's approach to maintaining approximately 60 days of rare earth consumption in strategic reserves may be adopted by other nations concerned about supply disruptions.

Trade Policy Alignment: Democratic allies are increasingly coordinating their approaches to critical minerals energy security, creating a more unified response to China's market dominance.

The European Commission exemplifies this approach, targeting processing at least 40% of critical raw materials consumed within member states by 2030 and recycling 15% of critical materials. This represents a strategic shift from near-complete import dependence for several rare earth elements.

What Are The Long-Term Implications?

Reshaping of Global Resource Geopolitics

China's export controls are accelerating several fundamental shifts in how nations approach resource security:

Friend-Shoring Acceleration: Countries are increasingly prioritizing politically aligned trading partners for critical materials, even at premium prices.

Premium for Stable Jurisdictions: Mining projects in politically stable, Western-aligned countries may receive higher valuations due to their strategic importance.

Government Intervention: Increased direct government involvement in rare earth supply chains through investment, regulation, and strategic stockpiles.

New International Frameworks: Development of new multi-lateral agreements governing critical minerals trade among like-minded nations.

According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, ""friend-shoring"" involves preferential trade and investment relationships among politically aligned nations. For critical minerals, this includes formal partnerships like the U.S.-Australia-Japan-India Quad partnership and bilateral agreements prioritizing supply from democratic allies.

Investment Considerations

The emerging rare earth landscape creates several investment implications:

Supply-Demand Imbalance: The International Energy Agency projects demand for rare earth elements could increase by 3-7 times by 2040 under various clean energy transition scenarios, creating potential for sustained higher prices.

Capital Requirements: Developing alternative supply chains requires substantial investment—approximately $15-25 billion over the next decade to meaningfully diversify global rare earth supply chains.

Value Chain Integration: Companies controlling multiple stages of the rare earth value chain may receive premium valuations due to their strategic importance.

Acquisition Activity: Established mining companies and OEMs may acquire early-stage rare earth projects to secure future supply.

Technology Development Impacts

The supply chain disruption is driving several technological responses:

Materials Research: Manufacturers are increasing funding for research into reduced rare earth usage or complete alternatives.

Recycling Expansion: Urban mining initiatives are targeting electronic waste, although current battery recycling advancements remain below 1% due to technical and economic challenges.

Resource Efficiency: Product designers are optimizing rare earth usage to minimize supply vulnerabilities.

Alternative Technologies: Development of non-rare earth motors, magnets, and other components that can perform similarly to rare earth-based systems.

How Can Investors Position For This New Reality?

Key Investment Criteria for Rare Earth Companies

Investors evaluating rare earth opportunities should consider several factors:

Geographic Location: Projects in politically stable, Western-aligned jurisdictions with clear permitting pathways

Development Stage: Near-term producers with defined timelines to production face lower execution risk than early-stage exploration projects

Processing Capability: Companies with refining expertise or established processing partnerships can capture more of the value chain

Customer Relationships: Established connections with Western manufacturers provide revenue visibility and potential financing support

Government Support: Projects aligned with national security interests may receive expedited permitting, financing assistance, and offtake agreements

Risk Factors to Consider

Despite the positive investment thesis, significant challenges remain:

Technical Complexity: Rare earth processing involves chemically intensive, environmentally challenging processes requiring specialized expertise developed over decades in China.

Capital Intensity: Establishing rare earth refining capacity requires $500 million to $1.5 billion in capital investment and 5-7 years for facility development.

Potential Oversupply: If too many Western projects advance simultaneously, new capacity could eventually exceed demand, pressuring prices.

Regulatory Hurdles: Environmental permits for processing facilities remain challenging in many Western jurisdictions due to concerns about radioactive byproducts.

Chinese Counter-Strategies: China could potentially lower prices temporarily to make Western projects uneconomical or increase investment in rare earth resources outside its borders.

FAQs About China's Rare Earth Export Controls

What specific rare earth elements are now under export control?

The latest restrictions add holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium to the previously restricted elements (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium). These elements are critical for applications ranging from fiber optic communications and lasers to specialized glass and nuclear technologies.

How quickly could Western supply chains adapt to these restrictions?

Developing alternative rare earth supply chains typically requires 5-10 years for new mines and 3-5 years for processing facilities. However, accelerated government funding and existing projects could potentially reduce these timeframes. The most immediate responses will likely come from existing producers expanding capacity rather than entirely new operations.

Will these restrictions affect consumer product prices?

While rare earths represent a small portion of final product costs (typically less than 2% of an EV's cost), sustained supply constraints could eventually impact pricing for products like EVs, smartphones, and wind turbines if manufacturers cannot secure alternative supplies. The more immediate impact may be on product availability rather than direct price increases.

How might China respond to Western efforts to develop alternative supplies?

China has several potential counter-strategies, including temporarily lowering rare earth prices to make Western projects uneconomical, increasing investment in rare earth resources outside China, developing new technologies that reduce reliance on restricted elements, or offering preferential access to manufacturers who maintain production facilities within China.

What role will recycling play in addressing rare earth supply challenges?

Recycling currently accounts for less than 1% of rare earth supply but could grow significantly as new technologies and economic incentives develop. Urban mining of electronic waste represents a potentially significant future source, though technical challenges include the low concentrations of rare earths in individual products and complex material mixtures.

Queensland led state-level capacity additions with 2.2GW of new projects, followed by New South Wales contributing 2GW to the national pipeline. The state’s solar sector has also demonstrated strong operational performance, with utility-scale plants dominating performance rankings and consistently topping utility performance metrics.

Solar PV additions totalled 800MW, primarily from smaller hybrid projects that combine solar generation with battery storage. The hybrid approach has become increasingly common as developers seek to optimise project economics and grid integration capabilities.

This is perhaps best showcased in the latest Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) Tender 4 results, which saw 6.6GW of renewables awarded long-term contracts, many of which comprise solar-plus-storage configurations.

Utility-scale battery storage additions make up 78% of new capacity

Utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) comprised 78% of total capacity additions during September, with 4.5GW distributed across 24 individual assets.

The dominance of battery storage projects reflects the growing recognition of energy storage as essential infrastructure for grid stability as renewable energy penetration increases across the National Electricity Market (NEM).

ACEnergy emerged as a major contributor via its Croydon solar-plus-storage project, which combines 625MW of solar generation with a 500MW/2,000Wh battery system.

Lightsource bp also advanced its storage portfolio with a 49MW/562MWh DC-coupled BESS addition at the Goulburn River Solar Farm. At the same time, Neoen achieved a milestone with the completion of the 270MW/540MWh Western Downs BESS Stage 2.

The system brings Neoen’s Western Downs facility’s total capacity to 540MW/1,080MWh, establishing it as Australia’s largest operational battery project, Shukla said.

Developer Tilt Renewables also contributed to the battery storage expansion with its 100MW/200MWh Latrobe Valley BESS, adding grid-scale storage capacity in Victoria’s transition away from coal-fired generation.

Wind energy additions proved minimal during September, with only Green Wind Renewables’ 450MW Mahogany Wind Farm in Western Australia contributing to the technology segment.

Shukla said the limited wind activity contrasts with stronger performance in previous months and reflects the project-specific nature of development announcements.

Strong approval and deal activity

Project approvals exceeded 3GW during September, indicating continued regulatory progress despite slower development pipeline announcement activity.

Federal EPBC approvals advanced several major developments, including ACEN’s 943MW Valley of the Winds project and the 1.3GW Pottinger Energy Park developed by AGL and Someva Renewables.

Edify Energy secured federal approval for its 300MW Nowingi solar-plus-storage project, adding to the company’s substantial development pipeline before its acquisition by La Caisse.

State-level fast-track approvals included TrinaSolar’s Killawarra Hybrid project in New South Wales and Pacific Green’s 1GW Portland Energy Park in Victoria.

Contract activity remained strong throughout September despite slower project announcements. HiTHIUM Energy Storage secured a battery supply contract for FRV’s 250MW/500MWh Gnarwarre BESS, while GenusPlus Group won EPC work for Alinta Energy’s Wagerup BESS project.

Transparency is vital Many of the figures circulating about AI energy use are unreliable because AI firms disclose so little.","OpenAI’s recent rollout of its new video generator Sora 2 marks a watershed moment in AI. Its ability to generate minutes of hyper-realistic footage from a few lines of text is astonishing, and has raised immediate concerns about truth in politics and journalism.

But Sora 2 is rolling out slowly because of its enormous computational demands, which point to an equally pressing question about generative AI itself: What are its true environmental costs? Will video generation make them much worse?

The recent launch of the Stargate Project — a US$500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX — to build massive AI data centres in the United States underscores what’s at stake. As companies race to expand computing capacity on this scale, AI’s energy use is set to soar.

The debate over AI’s environment impact remains one of the most fraught in tech policy. Depending on what we read, AI is either an ecological crisis in the making or a rounding error in global energy use. As AI moves rapidly into video, clarity on its footprint is more urgent than ever.

Two competing narratives

From one perspective, AI is rapidly becoming a major strain on the world’s energy and water systems.

Alex de Vries-Gao, a researcher who has long tracked the electricity use of bitcoin mining, noted in mid-2025 that AI was on track to surpass it. He estimated that AI already accounted for about 20 per cent of global data-center power consumption; this is likely to double by year’s end.

According to the International Energy Agency, data centres used up to 1.5 per cent of global electricity consumption last year, with consumption growing four times faster than total global demand. The IEA predicts that data centres will more than double their use by 2030, with AI processing the leading driver of growth.

Research cited by MIT’s Technology Review concurs, estimating that by 2028, AI’s power draw could exceed “all electricity currently used by US data centers” — enough to power 22 per cent of U.S. households each year.

‘Huge’ quantities

AI’s water use is also striking. Data centres rely on ultra-pure water to keep servers cool and free of impurities. Researchers estimated that training GPT-3 would have used up 700,000 litres of freshwater at Microsoft’s American facilities. They predict that global AI demand could reach four to six billion cubic metres annually by 2027.

Hardware turnover adds further strain. A 2023 study found that chip fabrication requires “huge quantities” of ultra-pure water, energy-intensive chemical processes and rare minerals such as cobalt and tantalum. Manufacturing the high-end graphics processing units — the engines that drive AI boom — has a much larger carbon footprint than most consumer electronics.

Read more: The importance of critical minerals should not condone their extraction at all costs

Generating an image uses the electricity of a microwave running for five seconds, while making a five-second video clip takes up as much as a microwave running for over an hour.

The next leap from text and image to high-definition video could dramatically increase AI’s impact. Early testing bears this out — finding that energy use for text-to-video models quadruples when video length doubles.

The case for perspective

Others see the alarm as overstated. Analysts at the Center for Data Innovation, a technology and policy think tank, argue that many estimates about AI energy use rely on faulty extrapolations. GPU hardware is becoming more efficient each year, and much of the electricity in new data centres will come from renewables.

Recent benchmarking puts AI’s footprint in context. Producing a typical chatbot Q&A consumes about 2.9 watt-hours (Wh) — roughly 10 times a Google search. Google recently claimed that a typical Gemini prompt uses only 0.24 Wh and 0.25 mL of water, though independent experts note those numbers omit indirect energy and water used in power generation.

Context is key. An hour of high-definition video streaming on Netflix uses roughly 100 times more energy than generating a text response. An AI query’s footprint is tiny, yet data centres now process billions daily, and more demanding video queries are on the horizon.

Jevons paradox

It helps to distinguish between training and use of AI. Training frontier models such as GPT-4 or Claude Opus 3 required thousands of graphics chips running for months, consuming gigawatt-hours of power.

Using a model takes up a tiny amount of energy per query, but this happens billions of times a day. Eventually, energy from using AI will likely surpass training.

The least visible cost may come from hardware production. Each new generation of chips demands new fabrication lines, heavy mineral inputs and advanced cooling. Italian economist Marcello Ruberti observes that “each upgrade cycle effectively resets the carbon clock” as fabs rebuild highly purified equipment from scratch.

And even if AI models become more efficient, total energy keeps climbing. In economics, this is known as the Jevons paradox: in 19th-century Britain, the consumption of coal increased as the cost of extracting it decreased. As AI researchers have noted, as costs per-query fall, developers are incentivized to find new ways to embed AI into every product. The result is more data centres, chips and total resource use.

A problem of scale

Is AI an ecological menace or a manageable risk? The truth lies somewhere in between.

A single prompt uses negligible energy, but the systems enabling it — vast data centres, constant chip manufacturing, round-the-clock cooling — are reshaping global energy and water patterns.

The International Energy Agency’s latest outlook projects that data-centre power demand could reach 1,400 terawatt-hours by 2030. This is the equivalent of adding several mid-sized countries to the world’s grid. AI will count for a quarter of that growth.

Transparency is vital

Many of the figures circulating about AI energy use are unreliable because AI firms disclose so little. The limited data they release often employ inconsistent metrics or offset accounting that obscures real impacts.

One obvious fix would be to mandate disclosure rules: standardized, location-based reporting of the energy and water used to train and operate models. Europe’s Artificial Intelligence Act requires developers of “high-impact” systems to document computation and energy use.

Similar measures elsewhere could guide where new data centres are built, favouring regions with abundant renewables and water — this could encourage longer hardware lifecycles instead of annual chip refreshes.

Balancing creativity and cost

Generative AI can help unlock extraordinary creativity and provide real utility. But each “free” image, paragraph or video has hidden material and energy costs.

Acknowledging those costs doesn’t mean we need to halt innovation. It means we should demand transparency about how great the environmental cost is, and who pays it, in order to address AI’s environmental impacts.

As Sora 2 begins to fill social feeds with highly realistic visuals, the question won’t be whether AI uses more energy than Netflix, but whether we can expand our digital infrastructure responsibly enough to make room for both.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/695410/original/file-20251009-56-py3wn3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C247%2C3967%2C1983&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-10 11:00:59.757811

The world’s first high-volume vacuum-insulating glass production facility is already making waves.

Founded in 2016 in Ypsilanti, a suburb of Ann Arbor, LuxWall’s mission has always been clear: to push the boundaries of energy efficiency through innovative materials. But the decision to expand in Michigan was about more than just business — it was about honoring its roots. Despite competitive offers from neighboring states, LuxWall chose Michigan, a place that not only fosters its growth but remains steadfast in cultivating an equally pro-business and suitable environment.

The Litchfield facility, with its 87 workers, is already producing cutting-edge, energy-efficient windows designed to help buildings reduce heating and cooling costs while minimizing their carbon footprint. This $20 million investment represents the first phase of a much larger vision that will see 450 new jobs created across Michigan as part of a broader $165 million investment. The company already has plans to evaluate Detroit for a second facility that will triple production capacity.

This project is supported by $6 million in state grants and over $31 million in federal funding, underscoring the importance of this venture not only to LuxWall but to the State of Michigan and its growing green tech economy.

Robert Bosch, LLC

Robert Bosch, LLC, a part of the Bosch Group, has a long history of developing advanced solutions across a variety of industries, including mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and energy and building technology.

Recently, Bosch has turned its focus to the emerging clean energy sector, investing $13.7 million to expand its Farmington Hills headquarters with a cutting-edge Regional Hydrogen Research and Development Hub. Backed by a $500,000 performance-based grant through the Michigan Business Development Program (MBDP), Bosch plans to upgrade and restructure 2,200 sq. ft. of existing space dedicated to driving advancements in hydrogen technologies, including Bosch’s Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell power module, a highly integrated and compact system solution for fuel cell-electric commercial vehicles. The new hub will include facilities to test hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines, as well as produce onsite hydrogen via water electrolysis.

While Bosch operates in over 100 locations across North America, the decision to expand in Farmington Hills was influenced by several factors unique to Michigan. Matt Thorington, engineering manager of hydrogen stacks and systems at Bosch USA, emphasizes the state’s ongoing commitment to hydrogen development, including its involvement in the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2), as a contributing component.

This regional initiative supports the development of clean hydrogen technologies and fosters collaboration to build a sustainable hydrogen economy — an effort that resonates deeply with Bosch’s own goals.

“Hydrogen will play a role in a diversified mix of powertrain options in the future,” says Thorington. “Our work at the Farmington Hills location underscores our commitment to advancing hydrogen technology, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions that support our customers' needs and drive progress toward the hydrogen economy. We have a strong team developing here and by locating our knowledge close to our existing powertrain expertise, we benefit from the broad system knowledge that Bosch has when it comes to powertrain. Having a site where the completion of this hydrogen cycle is possible is key to taking advantage of the entire ecosystem from production to offtake.”

With companies like UL Solutions, LuxWall, and Bosch leading the charge, Michigan isn’t just adapting to a clean energy future — it’s helping define it.",https://www.michiganbusiness.org/contentassets/aa7ed919b44e4a709546ca3d2bac1f93/michigan-made-innovations_1200x627.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:58:58.448126

Carolina Renewable Products (CRP), a clean energy company, announced it is establishing operations in Orangeburg County.

The company’s $280 million investment will create 155 new jobs, according to Gov. Henry McMaster’s office.

“South Carolina has a rich forestry and agricultural tradition, and we are proud to harness that strength to fuel a cleaner, more resilient future,” said Carolina Renewable Products CEO Robert Bryan.

Bryan added, “Our facility will not only provide a reliable outlet for local forestry but also create products that aid South Carolina’s energy independence and help farmers, growers and businesses thrive while advancing the state’s leadership in renewable energy.”

CRP converts sustainable wood biomass into renewable diesel, biochar and wood vinegar.

The company offers a modular and cost-effective design, delivering low-carbon fuel solutions while supporting local agriculture and forestry.

CRP recently purchased its inaugural site, at 546 Prosperity Drive in Orangeburg, which will be a next-generation biomass-to-renewable diesel facility and serve as the company’s headquarters and training hub.

Operations are expected to be online in late 2026. Those interested in joining CRP should contact jobs@carolinarenewableproducts.com.

The state’s Coordinating Council for Economic Development approved job development credits related to the project.

The council also awarded a $750,000 Closing Fund grant to Orangeburg County to assist with the costs of site preparation and building construction.

“Carolina Renewable Products is making a major investment in our state and our agribusiness industry, and it couldn’t come at a better time,” said state Commissioner of Agriculture Hugh Weathers.

He added, “This new facility and training hub will support South Carolina timber growers and local farms while protecting natural resources.”

Pratt Industries, a provider of custom packaging solutions, announced it is expanding its York County operations with a new manufacturing facility.

The company’s $92.5 million investment will create 116 new jobs, according to the South Carolina Department of Commerce.

“We are excited to expand our operations in the great state of South Carolina and the mid-Atlantic region,” said Pratt Industries Global Executive Chairman Anthony Pratt. “Our new facility supports our continued commitment to invest in recycling, clean energy infrastructure and American manufacturing jobs.”

“Pratt Industries investing $92.5 million to establish a new facility in York County is a big win for South Carolina’s recycling industry,” said Gov. Henry McMaster. “This project will create 116 new jobs and marks an important step forward in strengthening our state’s reputation in sustainability and manufacturing.”

With more than 35 years of experience, Pratt Industries is one of the largest corrugated packaging companies in the U.S. and one of the world’s largest, privately held producers of 100 percent recycled containerboard.

Pratt Industries will upfit the facility at 2087 Williams Industrial Blvd. in Rock Hill to manufacture its packaging products.

In addition to the new operation, the company operates a recycling center in Rock Hill.

The outlook for the U.S. economy among financial decision-makers improved somewhat in the third quarter of 2025, as uncertainty declined.

However, concerns about the impact of tariffs on prices and business performance continued to weigh on firms, according to the CFO Survey, a collaboration of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond represents the Fifth District, which includes the states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, and most of West Virginia, along with Washington, D.C.

Uncertainty remains a top concern of financial decision-makers, but it dropped in importance from second highest in the second quarter to seventh in the third quarter.

“Likely, it is the fall in uncertainty that helped boost optimism in the third quarter,” said Sonya Ravindranath Waddell, vice president and economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

Waddell added, “The return of optimism and GDP expectations to levels more in line with the beginning of 2024 is reassuring. But concern about tariffs is real and impactful for many CFOs in the survey.”

For the third consecutive quarter, tariffs and trade policy were the top concern among survey respondents, followed by monetary policy and inflation. The firms that cited tariffs as a top concern were notably more downbeat about the economy and their own firm.

Specifically, these firms:

* Were less optimistic about the U.S. economy (59.9 for the tariff-concerned group versus 64.3 for those unconcerned).

* Projected lower real GDP growth for the year ahead (1.6 percent versus 2.0 percent).

* Had lower revenue and employment growth expectations for 2025.

* Forecasted notably higher input cost growth in 2025 and 2026.

* Expected higher price growth in 2025 and 2026.

Overall, CFOs projected that tariffs would have a big impact on price growth: On average, price growth would be about 30 percent lower in 2025 and roughly 25 percent lower in 2026 without the addition of tariffs, indicating that firms expect to grapple with tariff-related price increases into 2026.

Meanwhile, almost a quarter of firms continued to report that they will decrease capital spending in 2025 due to tariffs.

The CFO Survey is issued by Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business and the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta.

The latest survey, as well as historical data and a detailed analysis of the impact of the election on the corporate outlook, can be found at www.cfosurvey.org.

The city of Orangeburg said City Council has passed the Hate Intimidation Ordinance, aimed at protecting residents from acts of intimidation or harassment based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, and other protected classes.

The ordinance establishes clear penalties for violations, including:

* A fine of up to $500.

* A misdemeanor charge or up to 30 days in jail, or both at the discretion of the judge.

Mayor Michael C. Butler emphasizes the significance of the legislation:

“Passing the Hate Intimidation Ordinance is a major step in ensuring that every resident of Orangeburg feels safe, respected, and valued in our community. Our city stands firmly against acts of hate and intimidation, and this ordinance reinforces that commitment.”

The city of Orangeburg encourages residents to report any incidents of hate intimidation to local law enforcement.

Officials said the ordinance reflects the city’s ongoing dedication to public safety, civil rights, and a welcoming environment for all citizens.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, praised the move.

“We welcome the passage of this important ordinance to combat hate crimes,” said CAIR National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper. “We again urge South Carolina lawmakers to follow suit and pass an anti-hate crime bill statewide.”

CAIR previously supported a similar ordinance in Orangeburg County.",http://locable-assets-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/resource/file/1246215/unnamed_20-_202025-10-09T135656.095.jpg?timestamp=1760065246,N,,2025-10-09 23:00:48.985833

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘ Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.","As Colorado darts toward a future powered by “clean” energy, a battle is brewing in Pueblo, where coal closures, union jobs and lost tax revenue collide with a community demanding a solution as its power plants are a primary target for a shutdown.

Between 2025 and 2031, six more coal-fired power plants in Colorado are scheduled to be shut down or converted to another energy source, such as natural gas.

With more than 800 jobs to be affected, another three plants are on the list for future closures.

The closures are raising alarm bells, notably for the unions that count the power plant workers as members. A group has put forward an action plan called the Colorado Energy Compact, calling for a “balanced and sustainable energy policy” and a transition that is “are “clear, stable, and grounded in the realities of our grid, our workforce, and our economy.”

Besides unions and jobs, taxes paid to local communities are also a major worry, with revenue ranging from 12% of the total collected in Pueblo County to as high as 33.7% in Moffat County.

The compact is drawing together more than two dozen organizations and individual experts in energy, labor and public policy, according to Action Colorado’s Sara Blackhurst.

The plan is designed as both a tool and an accountability check for lawmakers and regulators, focusing on a state standard that, the compact maintains, should be technology-neutral and which supports a balanced mix of current and emerging technologies. The goal, the compact said, is to ensure a transition that benefits Colorado’s environmental and economic future, protects families, and sustains local economies.

The fight over Comanche plants

In Pueblo, residents are fighting back to keep the Comanche power plants open. They oppose wind or solar energy, which they claim is unreliable.

The Comanche station just south of Pueblo is a 695-acre site with a rail system, water contracts, transmission capacity and injection, according to a report from the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee. It includes three coal-generating units “that have provided highly-paid, family supporting jobs and tax payments of tens of millions of dollars for decades,” the report said.

Comanche 1 closed in 2022. Comanche 2 will close in 2025. Comanche 3, which opened in 2010, will close no later than Jan. 1, 2031, about 10 years ahead of schedule.

The controversy surrounding the Comanche power plants comes at a time when the Trump administration has withdrawn support for “clean” energy, cutting over $500 million in grants to Colorado companies and universities. Additionally, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a Colorado native, said he wants to “unleash American energy at home and abroad.” Wright said America should focus on ensuring a wide array of cheap, abundant and sustainable energy sources that include geothermal, nuclear, oil and gas.

The campaign to save the Comanche plants suggests a major battle is brewing over the two Xcel units in Pueblo.

The Colorado Fiscal Institute, in a Sept. 2024 report, said the closure of Comanche 3 alone will cost about 77 jobs and about $31 million annually in tax revenue to the Pueblo community.

The same report said the Environmental Protection Agency’s CO-Benefits Risk Assessment tool estimated that closing Comanche 3 would result in avoided health costs benefiting Colorado between $52 million and $67 million annually, with Pueblo County specifically benefiting between $4.6 million and $5.6 million.

The report downplayed the benefits of nuclear energy as a replacement energy source and instead recommended wind and solar.

On the opposite side, the Pueblo Innovative Energy Solutions Advisory Committee, a group initiated by Xcel Energy and made up of community leaders, has looked at potential replacements for the energy sources at Comanche 3.

The PIESAC group is led by attorney Frances Koncilja and investor Corinne Koehler; members Jerry Bellah, vice president of IBEW local 8; Sara Blackhurst of Action Colorado; Russell De Salvo, who heads the Pueblo Depot Authority; Patty Erjavec, former president of Pueblo Community College; former judge Dennis Maes; Timothy Mottet, a former president of CSU-Pueblo; Duane Nava, head of the Greater Pueblo Chamber; Jeff Shaw, president of Pueblo Economic Development; and former Pueblo County Commissioner Chris Wiseman.

The group’s report, which came out in January 2024, looked at all the impacts, noting “the Pueblo community has supported these early closures and done more to reduce emissions in the state than any other community.”

The report said the economic hit from closing Comanche 3 would total $196 million to Pueblo and result in the loss of hundreds of high-wage, career-level jobs. Pueblo would lose more than $845 million in tax revenues by 2070, the report added.

Its proposed solution: “Of all the technologies we studied, only advanced nuclear generation will make Pueblo whole and also provide a path to prosperity.”

The group believes that nuclear power would support 200 to 300 permanent high-paying jobs and generate $95 million in local property taxes.

The backup plan is combined cycle natural gas plant with carbon capture for 20 to 25 long-term jobs and about $16.5 million in annual tax revenue.

Wind and solar would generate “a handful of non-union jobs” and about $2 million annually in tax revenue, PIESAC said.

‘Just transition’

In August, the Public Utilities Commission deliberated on the first phase of a $15 billion “just transition” energy resource plan submitted by Xcel, Colorado’s largest utility company and operator of the Pueblo plants, that includes the future of the Comanche operations.

The plan is tied to a settlement agreement reached in 2022 between Xcel and partners that include state agencies, environmental groups, local governments, including the city of Pueblo and Pueblo County, and large customers, such as Walmart, and labor unions.

The “just transition” plan would add more than 6,000 megawatts of new generation and storage. Over the next five years, Xcel would add 10,000 megawatts of new generation and storage capacity. Final approval of both phases of the plan, according to Xcel, is expected sometime next year.

The settlement agreement aims to keep Pueblo “whole” regarding tax revenue by compensating the county for property tax revenue due to the acceleration of the retirement date of Comanche 3.

During the meeting, PUC Chair Eric Blank called the “just transition” plan the “single largest resource acquisition in the history of Colorado and an over $15 billion commitment from customers.”

The plan’s cost raised worries among the commission about its potential for “exorbitant” hikes in utility rates to ratepayers.

The PUC said it would issue a final decision on the first phase in the coming weeks.

In a statement issued by the Colorado Energy Office after the meeting, Gov. Jared Polis said he is “enthusiastic about the plan to save people money and achieve faster pollution reductions while bringing new jobs to communities and investing in rural Colorado.”

Polis added that “the free market is driving the transition to clean energy in a way that will help people hold on to more of their hard-earned money, clean our air, achieve energy independence, and continue our state’s economic growth.”

For its part, Xcel said it is committed to supporting its workforce both in Pueblo and Hayden with “reskilling and retraining programs, and efforts to retain employees in both the short and long term.” The company also said it is committed to addressing the tax revenue issue and listening to the voices of local leaders.

‘Pueblo is being robbed‘

Elected officials and community leaders in Pueblo County are not happy with the plan.

At the end of August, Pueblo County commissioners fought back, telling the PUC through a filing that they had invested limited financial resources and time to participate in the PUC’s proceeding, “as well as the promised follow-on ‘Pueblo Just Transition Solicitation’ to ensure that the residents of Pueblo County would receive a meaningful ‘Just Transition’ from a coal community to a high tech clean energy hub.”

The county also spent $2 million on the PIESAC study to develop clean energy generation options for Pueblo, and if implemented, those options, they said, would render Pueblo “whole.”

The commissioners claimed other partners in a settlement agreement, including the Colorado Energy Office, ignored Pueblo’s “bargained-for solutions.” They accused the Colorado Energy Office, the Office of Just Transitions and the Utility Consumer Advocate, which is part of PUC, of failing to act in good faith, including failing to consider the option of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement energy source.

The commissioners asked that Comanche 2 and Comanche 3 continue to operate, saying they would approach the Trump administration and Wright, the energy secretary, “until replacement generation is constructed in Pueblo.”

“The (PUC) has made it clear that it is a futile exercise to participate in these proceedings,” the county commissioners wrote.

The local electrical worker union in Pueblo also weighed in through a letter submitted to U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Grand Junction, whose district includes Pueblo.

In a Sept. 10 letter, Jerry Bellah, international vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, told Hurd his group supports green energy “but that the green jobs being offered to Pueblo do not come close to replacing the jobs that are currently at Comanche.”

Bellah said the handful of solar farm jobs are low-paying positions.

“For too long, the hardworking men and women of the IBEW have been ignored with false promises of middle-class, family-supporting jobs in exchange for our support in closing coal plants,” Bellah wrote. “We are smart enough, however, to know when we are getting the shaft, which is what is being done to the Pueblo community and the workers at Comanche. We all deserve better than this.”

Bellah noted Hurd had reached out to Trump to keep Comanche open and said his group would “support any elected leader, regardless of party, who supports jobs, and we will oppose any elected leader who votes to end our jobs.”

Pueblo County voters have now twice voted for Trump over his Democratic opponents.

Blackhurst of Action Colorado added that the union jobs issue is the primary reason for the energy compact.

“Pueblo is being robbed,” she told Colorado Politics. “They (state government) have made labor workers acceptable collateral,” as well as the communities in which they live and work.

The Colorado Energy Compact

Led by Action Colorado, the compact’s authors intend for it to provide a roadmap for building an energy future that is “ambitious, achievable, and rooted in Colorado’s best interests.”

It focuses on five areas — affordability and economic competitiveness; labor, community and “just transition;” energy system reliability and feasibility; legal and regulatory integrity; and transparency and accountability.

The first focus area, on affordability, would look at the cost to consumers, protecting the tax revenue base and long-term economic resilience.

The second focus — on labor and community — said any legislation or regulation should ensure comparable wages and benefits, as well as “enforceable” retraining, union participation and local hiring. It also calls for policies that allow workers to stay in their current communities.

A survey conducted by Colorado Mountain College and the state Office of Just Transition, and as reported by the Steamboat Pilot in March, said 61% of workers at the Craig Xcel plant and the Colowyo and Trapper mines want to stay in their local communities if they transition to new jobs.

The third focus — on energy system reliability — calls for a “realistic” phasing of timelines tied to permitting, workforce readiness and infrastructure — “not political deadlines.” It also recognizes the role of natural gas and emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, geothermal and nuclear power, which was added to the state’s list of “clean” energy technologies by the legislature in the 2025 session.

In the focus on legal and regulatory integrity, the compact said terms like “clean energy” and “eligible technologies” must be defined in law, not by regulators.

Additionally, transparency and accountability must include an open stakeholder process, with full notice and “without surprises” and models made public and independently validated, the compact said. It should also include a regular public review.

“Without accountability,” the compact said, “even well-intentioned rules look like closed-door deals and public trust collapses.”

Blackhurst told Colorado Politics that the groups behind the compact are sharing it with lawmakers, hoping it would provide a tool for reviewing legislation in the future.

That’s critical, Blackhurst said, as the PUC is going through a sunset review in the 2026 session.

A fact sheet provided to the Town of Gilchrist earlier this year stated that the compact, unlike the governor’s “top-down” Clean Energy Planning process, is more inclusive and offers a framework rooted in local control.

It is not a lobbying effort, the fact sheet insisted. But “without stakeholder-driven guardrails, the direction will be set by others — without you in the room,” it said.

Gilchrist town councilmembers unanimously approved joining the compact in August, along with providing some financial support.

Office of Just Transition

Approved by legislation in 2019, the Office of Just Transition focuses on economic development for communities affected by the closure of coal mines.

For the past several years, the office, with 3.5 full-time employees, has spent about $15 million annually on community development, worker education, and training for those areas.

What’s missing, many said, is wage parity — what workers earn when they transition from high-paying jobs to whatever comes next.

The BlueGreen Alliance, in a 2023 report, pointed to the wage parity issue.

When coal mines close, workers are vulnerable to job loss, and many will struggle to find comparable employment that aligns with their existing skills, experience, and compensation levels, according to the report.

The office has made progress in economic development by supporting small businesses and entrepreneurship, the report added. But the opportunities to find local “high-road” jobs for former coal workers have been missed.

“The quality of the job — such as the benefits offered like health insurance, a retirement plan, and workers’ compensation benefits, or wage parity to previous employment — is not being considered in program development or implementation” for OJT, the alliance said.

‘Extreme claims‘

In a response to Pueblo commissioners on Sept. 12, several environmental groups said any decision by PUC to change votes would lead to further controversy and litigation over procedural improprieties.

That’s a reference to comments by Blank, the PUC chairman, in a Sept. 4 hearing that he is considering taking “another look at some of the labor issues raised in the county’s response,” as well as revisiting a prior vote tied to Xcel’s plans for “credits for resource located in communities with retiring coal plants,” a main concern raised by Pueblo County.

The credits are part of a Near Term Procurement request by Xcel — a solicitation for the development of energy generation that would draw federal and state tax credits.

The coalition of environmental groups includes GreenLatinos, the Sierra Club, Vote Solar, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Physicians for Social Responsibility Colorado.

“Moreover, promising to revisit votes in response to baseless accusations of political bias and extreme claims (including a threat to invite federal interference) sets problematic precedent and may incentivize parties to make similarly baseless and extreme claims in the future to get the Commission’s attention when they are displeased with the Commissioner’s oral deliberations and decisions,” the coalition said.

The coalition, in particular, took issue with Blank’s statements and the Sept. 4 hearing, which the group said hinted at “unfairness,” since the PUC had already deliberated on the Xcel plan in August and failed to provide opportunities to other parties to address the issues raised by Pueblo County.

By revisiting votes on the Xcel plan, the PUC would reward Pueblo County for “flouting the Commission’s well-established hearing and deliberations process” without allowing other parties the same opportunity, the coalition said.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/f4d16eb3761c62277059baa5a2ab669e.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 21:59:38.502911

At least $5 billion has already been spent on investments such as the renewable power operator Neoen, the energy developer Geronimo Power, and the Indian wind and solar giant Evren. “Energy demand is growing fast, driven by the growth of artificial intelligence as well as electrification in industry and transportation,” Connor Teskey, Brookfield’s president and renewable power chief, said in a press release. “Against this backdrop we need an ‘any and all’ approach to energy investment that will continue to favor low carbon resources.”

2. Orsted’s stock issuance raises $9.4 billion

Orsted has been facing down headwinds for months. The Danish offshore wind giant has absorbed the Trump administration’s wrath as the White House deployed multiple federal agencies to thwart progress on building seaward turbines in the Northeastern U.S. Then lower-than-forecast winds this year dinged Orsted’s projected earnings for 2025. When the company issued new stock to fund its efforts to fight back against Trump, the energy giant was forced to sell the shares at a steep discount, as I wrote in this newsletter last month. Despite all that, the company has managed to raise the money it needed. On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Orsted had raised $9.4 billion. Existing shareholders subscribed for 99.3% of the new shares on offer, but demand for the remaining shares was “extraordinarily high,” the company said.

That wasn’t enough to stave off job cuts. Early Thursday morning, the company announced plans to lay off 2,000 employees between now and 2027. The cuts represented roughly one-quarter of the company’s 8,000-person global workforce. “This is a necessary consequence of our decision to focus our business and the fact that we'll be finalizing our large construction portfolio in the coming years — which is why we'll need fewer employees,” Rasmus Errboe, Orsted’s chief executive, said in a statement published on CNBC. ""At the same time, we want to create a more efficient and flexible organization and a more competitive Orsted, ready to bid on new value-accretive offshore wind projects.”

3. Gavin Newsom blocks permitting reform for geothermal in California

California operates the world’s largest geothermal power station, The Geysers, and generates up to 5% of its power from the Earth’s heat. But the state is far behind its neighbors on developing new plants based on next-generation technology. Most of the startups racing to commercialize novel methods are headquartered or building pilot plants in states such as Utah, Nevada, and Texas. A pair of bills to make doing business in California easier for geothermal companies was supposed to change that. Yet while Governor Gavin Newsom signed one statute into law that makes it easier for state regulators to certify geothermal plants, he vetoed a permitting reform bill to which the industry had pegged its hopes. “Every geothermal developer and energy org I talked to was excited about this bill,” Thomas Hochman, who heads the energy program at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation, wrote in a post on X. “The legislature did everything right, passing it unanimously. They even reworked it to accommodate certain classic California concerns, such as prevailing wage requirements.”

In a letter announcing his veto, the governor claimed that the law would have added new fees for geothermal projects. But an executive at Zanskar — the startup that, as Heatmap’s Katie Brigham reported last month, is using new technology to locate and tap into conventional geothermal resources — called the governor’s argument “weak sauce.” Far from burdening the industry, Zanskar co-founder Joel Edwards said on X, “this was a clean shot to accelerate geothermal today, and he whiffed it.”

4. Generate Capital lays off staff after replacing CEO

Last month, Generate Capital trumpeted the appointment of its first new chief executive in its 11-year history as the leading infrastructure investment firm sought to realign its approach to survive a tumultuous time in clean-energy financing. Less publicly, as Katie wrote in a scoop last night, it also kicked off company-wide job cuts. In an interview with Katie, Jonah Goldman, the firm’s head of external affairs, said the company “grew quickly and made some mistakes,” and now planned to lay off 50 people.

Generate once invested in “leading-edge technologies,” according to co-founder Jigar Shah, who left the firm to serve as the head of the Biden-era DOE Loan Programs Office. That included investments in projects involving fuel cells, anaerobic digesters, and battery storage. But from the outside, he said on the Open Circuits podcast he now co-hosts, the firm appears to have moved away from taking these riskier but potentially more lucrative bets. “They ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team, and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, Hey, we have all this stuff to sell. And the people that they went to said, Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar.”

5. Boston’s public housing to install heat pumps

Three of New England’s largest public housing agencies signed deals with the heat pump manufacturer Gradient to replace aging electric heaters and air conditioners with the company’s 120-volt, two-way units that provide both heating and cooling. The Boston Housing Authority, New England’s largest public housing agency, will kick off the deal by installing 100 all-weather, two-way units that both heat and cool at the Hassan Apartments, a complex for seniors and adults with disabilities in Boston’s Mattapan neighborhood. The housing authorities in neighboring Chelsea and Lynn — two formerly industrial, working-class cities just outside Boston — will follow the same approach.

Public housing agencies have long served a vital role in helping to popularize new, more efficient appliances. The New York City Housing Authority, for example, is credited with creating the market for efficient mini fridges in the 1990s. Last year, NYCHA — the nation’s largest public housing system — signed a similar deal with Gradient for heat pumps. Months later, as Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo exclusively reported at the time, NYCHA picked a winner in its $32 million contest for an efficient new induction stove for its apartments.

THE KICKER

Three chemists — Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar Yaghi — won the Nobel Prize for “groundbreaking discoveries” that ""may contribute to solving some of humankind’s greatest challenges, from pollution to water scarcity.” Just a few grams of the so-called molecular organic frameworks the scientists pioneered could have as much surface area as a soccer field, which can be used to lock gas molecules in place in carbon capture or harvest freshwater from the atmosphere.

Yet China’s dithering is more than just an environmental failure — it is a governing mistake. China’s weak climate pledge isn’t just bad news for the world; it shows an indecisive leadership that is undermining its country’s own competitiveness by sticking with dirty coal rather than transitioning rapidly to a cleaner future.

The new pledge — known in UN jargon as a nationally determined contribution, or NDC — reveals a disconnect between the government’s official position and the optimistic discourse that now surrounds China’s clean energy sector. China today is described as the world’s first electrostate; it stands at the vanguard of the solar and EV revolution, some say, ready to remake the world order against a coalition of petrostate dinosaurs.

The NDC makes it obvious that the Chinese government does not yet view itself in such a fashion. China might look like an adult, but it more closely resembles a gangly teenager who is still getting used to their body after a growth spurt. As the analyst Kingsmill Bond recently put it on Heatmap’s podcast Shift Key, Chinese clean tech manufacturers have unlocked a cleaner and cheaper path to economic development. It isn’t yet clear that China is brave enough to commit to it. If China is the adult in the room, in other words, we’re screwed.

The devil’s in the details

Let’s start by giving credit where due. For a country that had never offered an absolute emissions reduction target before, Xi’s promise — to cut emissions by 7% to 10% by 2035 — is a kind of progress. But observers expected China to go much further. Researchers at the University of Maryland and the Center for Research on Clean Air, for example, each suggested that emissions could decline by roughly 30% by that year. Only a reduction of this magnitude would actually keep the planet on a trajectory sufficiently close to the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

Many inside China’s policy apparatus considered such ambitious cuts to be infeasible; for instance, Teng Fei, deputy director of Tsinghua University’s Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy, described a 30% reduction as “extreme.” Conversations with knowledgeable insiders, however, suggested a headline reduction of up to 15% was viewed as plausible. In that light, the decision to commit a mere 7% to 10% can only be seen as disappointing.

The NDC obviously represents a floor and not a ceiling, and China has historically only made climate promises that it knows it will keep. But even then, China’s leadership has given itself tremendous wiggle room. This can be seen in part by what is not in Xi’s pledge: any firm commitment about when, exactly, China’s emissions will peak. (His previous pledge only said that it would happen in the 2020s.) While it’s quite possible that 2024 or 2025 will end up being the peak, as some expect, the new pledge creates a perverse incentive to delay and pollute more now. The speech also contained little on non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide — which, given China’s previous commitment to reach net zero on all warming gases by 2060, seems like a significant blind spot.

Other commitments are only impressive until you scratch the surface. Xi pledged that China would install 3,600 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity by 2035. That may sound daunting: The United States, the world’s No. 2 country for renewables capacity, has a combined 400 gigawatts of solar and wind. But China already has about 1,600 gigawatts installed. So China’s promise, in essence, is to add around 200 gigawatts of solar and wind each year until 2035 — and while that would be a huge number for any other country, it actually represents a significant slowdown for China. The country added 360 gigawatts of wind and solar combined last year, and has already installed more than 200 gigawatts of solar alone in the first eight months of this one. In this light, China’s renewables pledge seems ominous.

More distressingly for climate action, it is unclear if this comparatively slower pace of clean electricity addition will actually allow China’s electricity sector to decarbonize. As the electricity analyst David Fishman has noted, China’s overall electricity demand grew faster than its clean electricity generation last year, leaving a roughly 100 terawatt-hour gap — despite all that new solar and wind (and despite 16 gigawatts of new nuclear and hydroelectric power plants, too). Coal filled this gap. Last year, China began construction of almost 100 gigawatts of new coal plants even though its existing coal fleet already operates less than half of the time. These new plants represented more than 90% of the world’s new coal capacity in 2024.

China’s climate strategy — like every other country’s — requires electrifying large swaths of its economy. If new renewables diminish to only 200 gigawatts a year, then it seems implausible that its renewable additions could meet demand growth — let alone eat away substantial amounts of coal-fired generation — unless its economic growth significantly slows.

Slow-walking, not sprinting

Yet the news gets worse. Taken alone, the NDC’s weakness may speak of mere caution on China’s part, yet a number of policy changes to China’s electricity markets and industrial policy over the past year suggest its government is now slow-walking the energy transition.

In 2024, for instance, China started making capacity payments to coal-fired power plants. These payments were ostensibly designed to lubricate a plant’s economics as it shifted from 24/7 operation to a supporting role backing up wind and solar. Yet only coal plants — and not, for instance, batteries — were offered these funds, even though batteries can play a similar role more cheaply and China already makes them in scads. Even more striking, coal plants have been pocketing these funds without changing their behavior or even producing less electricity

At the same time, China’s central leadership has cut the revenues that new solar and wind farms receive from generating power. New solar and wind plants are now scheduled to receive less than the same benchmark price that coal receives — although the details of that discount vary by province and remain uncertain in most of them. Observers hope that this lower price, along with a more market-based dispatch scheme, will eventually allow renewables-heavy electricity systems to charge lower rates to consumers and displace more expensive coal power. However, there’s little clarity on if and when that will happen, and in the meantime, new renewables installations are plummeting as developers wait for more information to emerge.

Chinese industrial policy is exacerbating these trends. The world has long talked about Chinese overcapacity. Now even conversation in the Western media has progressed to discussing “involution” — a broader term that centers on the intensive competition that characterizes Chinese capitalism (and society). It suggests that Chinese firms are competing themselves out of business.

The market-leader BYD, for instance, has become synonymous with the Chinese battery-powered auto renaissance, but there are fears that even this seeming titan might have corrupted itself on the way. The company has larded an incredible amount of debt onto its books to fuel its race to the top of the sales charts; now, murmurs abound that the firm might be “the Evergrande of EVs” — a reference to the housing developer that collapsed into bankruptcy earlier this decade with hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. In recent months, BYD’s engine seems to be sputtering, with sales dropping in September 2025 compared with last year.

As such, the government has come in to try to negotiate new terms of competition so that firms do not end up doing irreparable harm to themselves and their future prospects. It is doing so in other sectors as well: In solar, it has tried to create a cartel of polysilicon manufacturers, a solar OPEC of sorts, to make sure that the pricing of that key input to the photovoltaic supply chain is at a level where the producers can survive.

This may all seem positive — and there is certainly an argument that the government could play a role in helping these new sectors negotiate the difficult waters that they find themselves in. But I interpret these efforts as further slow-walking of the energy transition. A slight reframing can help to understand why.

What is literally happening in these meetings? The government is bringing private actors into the same room to bang their heads together and deal with the reality that the current economic system is not working, largely because of intense competition — a problem likely best solved by forcing some of the firms and production capacity to shrink. Firms are unprofitable because exuberant supply has zoomed past current demand, and the country’s markets and politics are not prepared to navigate the potentially needed bankruptcies or their fallout. So the government is intervening, designing actions to generate the outcomes it desires.

Yet there is something contradictory about the government’s approach. A decarbonized world, after all, will be a world without significant numbers of internal combustion vehicles, so traditional automakers will eventually need to shut down or shift into EVs — yet their executives aren’t being dragged in for the same scolding. Likewise, a decarbonized world will be a world without as many coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Firms in the power sector should be scolded for continuing coal production at scale.

These are problems of the mid-transition, as the scholars Emily Grubert and Sara Hastings-Simon have described decarbonization’s current era. But China is further along in this transition than other states, and it could lead in the management and planning required for the transition as well.

The middle-income trap

China is stuck. For four decades, China’s growth rested on moving abundant cheap labor from low-productivity agriculture to higher productivity sectors, often in urban areas. The physical construction of China’s cities underpinned this development and became its own distorting bubble, launching a cycle of real-estate speculation. The government pricked this bubble in 2020, but since then, Chinese macroeconomic strength has failed to return.

Despite the glimmering nature of its most modern cities, China remains decidedly middle income, with a GDP per capita equivalent to Serbia. Many countries that have grown out of poverty have reached this middle income territory — but then become mired there rather than continuing to develop. This pattern, described as “the middle income trap,” has worried Chinese policymakers for years.

The country is obviously hoping that its new clean industries can offer a substitute motor to power China out of its middle-income status. Its leadership’s apparent decision to slow walk the energy transition, however, looks like a classic example of this “trap.” The leadership seems unwilling to jettison older industries in favor of the higher-value added industries of the future. The fact that the government has previously subsidized these industries just shows the complexity of the political economy challenges facing the regime.

The NDC’s announcement could be seen as an easy win given Trump’s climate backwardness. Clearly that’s what Xi was counting on. But China is too important to be understood only in contrast to the United States — and we should not applaud something that not only fails to recognize global climate targets, but also underplays China’s own development strategy. The country is nearing the release of its next five-year plan. Perhaps that document will incorporate more ambitious targets for the energy transition and decarbonization.

This summer, I visited Ordos in Inner Mongolia, a coal mining region that is now also home to some of China’s huge renewable energy megabases and a zero-carbon industrial park. Tens of thousands still labor in Ordos’ mines and coal-hungry factories, yet they seem like a relic of an earlier age when compared to the scale and precision of the new green industrial facilities. The dirty coal mines may still have history and profits on their side, but it is clear that the future will see their decline and replacement with green technology. I hope that Xi Jinping and the rest of the Chinese political elite come to the same conclusion, and fast.

Goldman’s comments echoed those of the firm’s new CEO, David Crane, a former undersecretary for infrastructure at the Department of Energy. In an article published to Generate’s website a few weeks ago, Crane admitted that the firm had “deviated from our operational roots,” a reference to the firm’s unconventional investment strategy.

Generate is unique as a sustainability-focused investor, in that it often acts as an owner and operator for the projects it finances rather than taking a passive equity stake The firm also provides tailored project financing options for its partners to help manage risk.

But over the past few years, Generate made a number of large equity investments in companies whose projects it did not directly oversee. These included utility-scale solar and energy storage developer Pine Gate Renewables, which is on the verge of bankruptcy, and green hydrogen developer Ambient Fuels, which was recently acquired by Electric Hydrogen amidst tumult in the industry.

“While other investors had no choice but to act as pure investors, we were distracted from who we are and what we were good at,” Crane wrote, noting that this distraction led to “poor performance in one component of our investment portfolio.” That would appear to be its equity division.

Generate’s model is designed to bridge a critical gap in the climate tech ecosystem known as the “missing middle,” the phase at which a company with some proven tech has outgrown early-stage venture capital but is still considered too risky for most traditional infrastructure investors. Historically, the firm has generated high returns by backing “leading-edge technologies,” Jigar Shah, the firm’s co-founder and former director of the DOE’s Loan Programs Office, said on the Open Circuit podcast he co-hosts. These include investments in projects involving fuel cells, anaerobic digesters, and battery storage.

Shah hasn’t worked at Generate since he joined the Biden administration in 2021. But from the outside, he says, the firm appears to have moved away from taking these riskier but potentially more lucrative bets. “They ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team, and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, Hey, we have all this stuff to sell. And the people that they went to said, Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar,“ Shah said on the podcast. As he saw it, Generate began making equity investments into lower-risk projects such as community solar, which naturally generated stable but lower returns. Then once interest rates went up post-Covid, that put downward pressure on equity returns.

Shah said it’s these slipping returns that have made it harder for Generate to raise capital over the past two years. Axios Pro recently reported that the firm is now exploring an IPO to bring in additional funding, following hesitation from some of its existing backers to reinvest.

While Goldman acknowledged that “there is some skepticism in the capital markets about our space now,” he disagreed with the idea that Generate has abandoned its focus on leading-edge technologies. “We have invested over the last number of years in a lot of assets that are predictable assets with predictable cash flows that have performed very strongly for our investors. And we continue to have the creativity of the team that’s focused on trying to bring newer technologies to the market to bridge the bankability gap,” he told me.

By way of example, he highlighted two of the firm’s most recent investments, a $200 million loan to Pacific Steel Group for the first green steel mill in California and a $100 million scalable credit facility for green data center developer Soluna, which allows the company to increase its borrowing capacity as new projects come online.

The latter deal was announced just weeks after Crane stepped into his new role. Having served as the CEO of five publicly traded energy companies before joining Generate, Crane is now promising to turn around the firm’s fortunes. With the Trump administration rolling back federal support for clean energy infrastructure and investors remaining cautious, Crane has said that now is the time to jump on undervalued opportunities.

“Right now, there’s a lot of noise telling people to stop writing checks. But this is precisely the time to invest in the infrastructure that will power the next twenty years,” he wrote. Goldman backed this up, telling me, “We believe managers who understand the space and who can take advantage of the opportunities that are underpriced in this tougher market environment are set up to succeed.”

Just as tech giants such as Google, Salesforce, and Amazon were able to expand rapidly in the wake of the dot-com bubble and consolidate their positions in the market, Generate’s leadership say they’re now well positioned to help select clean energy companies do the same.

It will certainly be a boon for the sector if they can, given the abundance of undercapitalized climate tech opportunities, from clean cement to thermal energy storage, next-generation geothermal, and carbon capture, all looking to build first-of-a-kind projects. And there’s not nearly enough infrastructure funding to go around.

So if Generate has indeed lost the confidence of its investors, it’s critical that Crane, Goldman, and company regain it swiftly. Their ability to do so could shape not only which technologies drive the energy transition, but how quickly they do so.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTcyNTg4MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxODE1NDU4OH0.yYhTWN0LaJR3xTSnvYmolk4qn24gG-j_3uPJx-ruyvc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-10 05:59:20.806637

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden’s actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president’s signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation’s most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden’s goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump’s efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices … and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

As of September 30, 2025, Volkswagen offered up to $12,350 in lease cash on the ID.4, depending on configuration. That included a $7,500 federal lease tax credit for lessees as Bonus Customer Cash, plus $3,500 to $4,850 in Dealer Lease Cash. It made the ID.4 one of the top EV lease deals around.

On October 1, those incentives vanished. While the ID.4 still has a 0% APR equivalent lease rate, drivers lost more than $12,000 in savings overnight. The ID. Buzz took a similar hit. Last month, the 2025 ID. Buzz offered $10,500 off MSRP between the $7,500 tax credit and $3,000 Dealer Lease Cash. Now, almost all lease cash is gone. VW Credit is offering just $750 in Dealer Lease Cash, and weirdly, not on models with two-tone paint. According to CarsDirect’s lease calculator, the lowest-priced ID. Buzz trim now carries an effective monthly cost topping $1,000 — a considerable jump.

For comparison, the ID. Buzz Pro S was previously advertised at $589 a month for 36 months with $5,999 due at signing, or an effective monthly cost of $756.

The ID.4 lease once cost just $233 a month, making it one of the cheapest EVs to lease. According to updated estimates, that figure is now north of $800 – that’s hair-raising.

Meanwhile, VW’s rivals are going in the opposite direction. Ford extended its Mustang Mach-E lease deals through early January. Subaru’s updated 2026 Solterra still qualifies for the $7,500 lease credit, and Jeep replaced the expiring EV lease credit with equivalent bonus cash.

If you really want a Volkswagen, though, there’s some good news: financing deals haven’t changed. The 2025 ID.4 continues to offer 0% APR for 72 months, and buyers of the ID. Buzz can still get up to $3,250 in Bonus Customer Cash through November 3, a perk unavailable to lessees.

It kinda seems like VW doesn’t want to lease their EVs anymore…?? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below.

EPA has doubled down on certain regulatory fronts, defending key hazardous substance designations for PFOA and PFOS, while simultaneously scaling back certain PFAS drinking water limits. These developments, together with EPA’s latest Unified Regulatory Agenda, reveal a more targeted approach to PFAS regulation in certain respects while, on the whole, continuing the march toward increased governmental obligations on the other.

Hazardous Substance Listings

On September 17, 2025, EPA filed an unopposed motion to lift the EPA-requested abeyance in U.S. Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, No. 24-1193 (D.C. Cir. 2024), informing the Court that the Agency intends to keep in place the designations of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. In a concurrent public statement, EPA confirmed that it will continue defending these designations in court and initiate a rulemaking to establish a uniform framework for future PFAS “hazardous substance” designations, including how costs will be considered.

The underlying litigation challenges the CERCLA designations as arbitrary and capricious on multiple grounds, including the alleged inadequacy of EPA’s regulatory impact analysis (discussed in detail in here). Given these arguments and the change in administration, many stakeholders anticipated that EPA would support rescission of the designations. The Agency’s recent filings, however, indicate that it intends to preserve them, signaling a continued commitment to maintaining PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances.

On September 25, 2025, the D.C. Circuit granted EPA’s motion to lift the abeyance and set briefing to resume, with petitioners’ joint reply due November 14, 2025.

Maximum Contaminant Levels

Separately, on September 10, 2025, EPA filed a motion in American Water Works Association v. EPA, No. 24-1188 (D.C. Cir. 2024), seeking partial vacatur of certain elements of its April 2024 PFAS drinking water rule. That rule established maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for six PFAS compounds: PFOA and PFOS, regulated individually, and PFHxS, PFNA, HFPO-DA (GenX) and certain mixtures, regulated collectively.

In May of 2025, however, EPA announced its intent to maintain its NPDWRs for PFOA and PFOS but withdraw the other four MCLs. During a July 2024 meeting of EPA’s National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), the Agency indicated that by the end of 2025, it would propose a rulemaking to retain the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS but extend compliance deadlines to 2031. The September 10, 2025, motion is consistent with this announcement, as EPA requested that the Court vacate the MCLs for PFNA, PFHxS, HFPO-DA (GenX) and the combined Hazard Index for PFAS mixtures, while leaving the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS in place. Responses to the motion to vacate were filed; however, the case is currently stayed at EPA’s unopposed request in light of the lapse in federal appropriations.

The Unified Regulatory Agenda Indicates a More Comprehensive Regulatory Approach

EPA’s September 2025 Unified Regulatory Agenda further illustrates the Agency’s sustained yet more selective focus on PFAS regulation. Several pending and planned rulemakings indicate continued PFAS-focused regulatory activities from EPA, including:

Clean Water Act Permitting. EPA is considering updates to PFAS-related requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits for sewage effluent treatment facilities. Currently, permit applicants are only required to report discharges of certain pollutants listed in existing regulations. (See 40 CFR 122.21.) A future rulemaking could add certain PFAS compounds to this list, though EPA has acknowledged that there are no currently approved analytical methods for PFAS in NPDES permitting.

The Agency anticipates a proposed rule by the end of 2025 and finalizing updates in 2027.

Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs). EPA is also considering ELGs for organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers to address discharges from facilities at which PFAS are manufactured. ELGs set industry-specific wastewater standards based on the performance of the best available, economically achievable technology. Facilities are not required to use the specific technology EPA identifies in setting the limits, but they must meet the resulting discharge limits.

EPA first signaled its intent to revisit PFAS-related ELGs in its 2023 Effluent Guidelines Program Plan 15, which outlines the Agency’s strategy for reducing water pollution. In that plan, EPA noted that landfill ELGs should be revised to account for PFAS in landfill leachate. The September 2025 Unified Agenda indicates that a proposed ELG rulemaking is anticipated in 2026.

TSCA Reporting Rule. EPA intends to revise the scope of the PFAS Reporting Rule under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule creates a potentially time-consuming and onerous reporting obligation for any PFAS, including the importation of any PFAS incorporated within mixtures and articles. EPA has already moved to delay the PFAS Reporting Rule twice, with the required data submission window now set to open for most manufacturers on April 13, 2026, and close on October 13, 2026.

The Unified Agenda provides that “EPA plans to propose the incorporation of certain exemptions and other modifications to the scope of the reporting rule.” A proposed rule on this issue may be released by the end of 2025.

Sixth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR 6). The UCMR provides a mechanism for EPA to collect data regarding impacts to public water systems from “emerging contaminants,” for which the SDWA does not otherwise require sampling and mitigation. Both UCMRs 3 and 5 included PFAS among the 30 chemicals for which each rule required sampling. Although it is still unclear whether UCMR 6 will do so as well, several entities that responded to the request for comments on this rule—published in the Federal Register on February 8, 2024—advocated that PFAS be included within the sampling suite of chemicals.",https://pfas.pillsburylaw.com/files/2023/07/social-image-logo-og-1000x1000.png,N,,2025-10-09 22:00:11.364338

The conversation at RE+ this year wasn’t just about renewables; it was about navigating a new energy reality. On one hand, demand for electricity is surging, from the explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers to the rapid electrification of vehicles and buildings. On the other hand, how do we ensure “just and reasonable” utility rates, keeping the electricity bills affordable for customers?

A Perfect Storm of Challenges

A major concern is resource adequacy. While AI and data centers are driving significant load growth, the interconnection queue is clogged with renewable projects. This interconnection backlog is delaying clean energy from coming online just as new load growth accelerates.

Electricity affordability is another concern amid load growth and lagging supply. The IRA’s tax credits have turbocharged clean energy investment, but the phaseout schedule under the OBBBA, coupled with foreign entity of concern (FEOC) compliance rules, threatens to drive up project costs. Developers are already warning that power purchase agreement (PPA) prices could climb, and ultimately, those costs land on customer bills. In addition, higher transmission buildout costs and soaring capacity auction prices have created more pressure on customers.

Turning Challenges into Opportunities

Unleash What We Can Build Fast

Among all the available technologies, solar and storage can be brought online quickly, making them the most viable option to support near-term AI-driven demand growth. Developers can bring solar projects online within just 18 to 24 months, compared to other resources such as wind, small modular reactors (SMRs), natural gas, and hydrogen fuel cells, which typically take 3 to 15 years from project conception to commercial operation.

To deploy the resources faster, we must react quickly to address the “soft cost” of time. Permitting and interconnection delays are the primary bottleneck. Every month of delay adds cost, jeopardizes project viability, and keeps us reliant on more expensive, marginal resources during peak times. We can speed things up by creating narrow, time-limited fast-track lanes for near-term reliability needs—limited to projects with proven site control, deliverability, and financing. MISO and SPP’s Expedited Resource Adequacy Study (ERAS) pilots show the feasibility of this model. Pair that with surplus interconnection at existing POIs, and clear transfer of rights at retiring sites to plug in capacity faster.

Maximize the Grid We Already Have

Building new transmission is essential, but slow and expensive. We can act now by deploying Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) across our existing network. Tools like Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) use sensors to determine a line’s real-time capacity, which is often higher than its static rating. Grid topology optimization software can re-route power flows to reduce congestion. These GETs are not silver bullets, but they can be an effective solution to maximize the transmission capacity across the existing power system.

Value Flexibility as a Resource

The existing U.S. grid can handle significant new loads such as data centers, as long as they can be curtailed when the electric system is stressed. Grid operators like ERCOT and PJM are now exploring policies like mandatory curtailment and demand-response programs for large load customers during critical hours.

On the supply side, at the grid edge, distributed energy resources (DERs) and virtual power plants (VPPs) can shave peaks, provide frequency services, and ease congestion. Unlocking this at scale takes market design and regulatory reform: FERC Order 2222 compels RTOs/ISOs to enable DER/VPP participation, while performance-based regulation can align utility incentives with demand-side optimization and include LMI-focused metrics to reduce bill spikes.

Looking Ahead

The unprecedented demand surge is the catalyst that the grid has needed for decades. It’s exposing pressing issues and pushing us toward a more dynamic, decentralized, and digitally native power system. The true test now lies in our market and policy designs: will they simply adapt, or unlock the full potential of this transformation?",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5915-scaled-aspect-ratio-1280-225-scaled-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 22:00:01.598205

Therefore, metros with an established presence in these sectors, or that have planned investments, should be most poised to benefit.

Reindustrialization efforts began with the previous administration’s passing of the CHIPS and Inflation Reduction Acts (IRA), which fueled new factory construction in these subsectors, particularly in Phoenix, Austin, Raleigh, Columbus, and Houston. While it will take time for construction to finish and jobs to materialize, we expect these—and Southern metros more broadly—to see the greatest benefits of the reindustrialization agenda.

Manufacturing-heavy metros, including those with large shares of jobs in these dynamic subsectors—Detroit (autos), San Jose (semiconductors and computers), Seattle (aerospace), Reading (batteries), and New York (pharmaceuticals)—saw healthy job growth through 2023. But many have since incurred declines over the last year as concerns stemming from tariffs, CHIPS and IRA funding, and lower immigration have clouded the outlook. These losses reinforce the need to maintain the momentum of building new capacity to support manufacturing job growth.

For planners looking to jumpstart more manufacturing, and who are considering criteria for selecting the best sites for new factories—available labor, density of skillsets, established supply chains, and broad-based infrastructure—we found that metros in Midwest states and central Pennsylvania score highest on these measures.

1) In 300 words or less, please give our readers your elevator pitch: Why are you running? Why should voters entrust you with this position? What prior experience will make you an effective member of the Carrboro Town Council?

I first ran for Carrboro Town Council in 2021 because I want to make our town more accessible to families like mine. We were drawn here for the reasons many people are—the cultural vibrancy, the proud activist legacy, the natural beauty combined with walkability. But the affordability crisis we’re seeing throughout the Triangle threatens those elements of our character, and makes it harder for more people to share the life I feel so lucky to have here. In my first term, we’ve taken major steps toward building a more economically diverse and accessible community, but the work isn’t done. It’s vital we continue to refine our land use policies to increase housing supply and affordability, improve our connectivity and climate resilience, and implement community safety practices that meet the problems of our current moment with care and compassion. I’m proud to have been a leading voice advocating for these changes as we’ve hired key leaders to new positions, adopted our first-ever Comprehensive Plan, and begun the revision of our town Land Use Ordinance. We’ve built a lot of momentum toward carrying out priorities that I think a lot of Carrboro shares, and I want to stick around to make sure we’ve got the results to show for it.

2) What would your priorities be as a member of the Carrboro Town Council? Please identify three of the most pressing issues Carrboro currently faces and how you believe the town should address them.

The largest priority I have in the coming term is the adoption of a new Land Use Ordinance. We need to codify an approach to development that accomplishes several crucial objectives: we need to add more housing at different price points to make it possible for more people to enter our housing market; we need to balance density against stormwater management, cooling, and green space preservation to maximize climate resilience in our community design; we need to increase the amount of businesses and build the density those businesses need to survive. All of this needs to happen while we use every tool legally permissible to construct affordable housing in market conditions that make it a steep challenge—in addition to incentivizing affordable units in our zoning approach, we need to be putting dollars into land banking and gap financing structures that allow us to have more transformative outcomes than we’ve been able to achieve through zoning alone. Ultimately, we know that we’re swimming upstream to help make dignified housing, which is a human right, available in a market and policy structure that has commodified it, but we can get more imaginative and aggressive to take a bigger bite out of the problem than we’ve been able to thus far.

I’m probably violatiing the spirit of the question by continuing to go on here, but we’re also very close to making strides with community safety practices built around mental health care and social service rather than armed police response, and we’ve put a lot of effort into streamlining our bike and pedestrian infrastructure project delivery, which I think will bear fruit over the next four years.

3) What’s the best or most important thing the Carrboro Town Council has done in the past year? Additionally, name a decision you believe the town should have handled differently. Please explain your answers.

Beginning the process of entirely revising our Land Use Ordinance is a massive, massive step for our Town. Given the fact that development decisions comprise the vast majority of what towns in North Carolina are responsible for, our land use is the biggest single thing we can control to see our values implemented.

In the last year, we explored some paid parking policies that I think I could have helped lead a more productive community discussion on. Ultimately, we’ve paused plans to pursue paid parking, and I think it’s a decent outcome that gives us a chance to consider the right order of operations to achieve the connectivity, transit usage, revenue strategies, and climate resilience we want. But I think the way we approached community for feedback—notwithstanding the efforts of our always-excellent communications staff—could have benefited from more framing that I failed to provide. Parking is a good synecdoche for the kinds of difficult trade-offs we have to consider when we look at values-driven polices at the local level: everybody appreciates what easy access to our downtown does for our businesses and arts communities, but road safety and eliminating Vehicle Miles Traveled are priorities I hear about constantly from Carrboro residents. I wish I’d taken a more active role to facilitate a broader, deeper discussion that built trust and mobilized more people into these considerations. While our staff did an excellent job gathering input and equipping Council to make deliberate decisions, I think I can do much better as a leader the next time we consider where we want to go on these policies.

4) President Trump is working to ramp up deportations and curtail visas. At the same time, the state legislature has passed laws requiring agencies to cooperate with ICE. What do you think Carrboro can or should do to ensure safe, welcoming communities for immigrants in light of these policies?

This is an area where people don’t often think about land use, but it’s a good issue for demonstrating how absolutely vital it is that more people can afford to live in Carrboro. The inclusivity and acceptance in our town is an active practice for many of our neighbors—as we’ve learned over and over in the past decade, nothing is safer than a strong community. But if people can’t afford to access communities that prioritize our values, we’re not as able to protect them as neighbors. An economically diverse town is a more racially and intergenerationally diverse town, and offers more opportunities for immigrant families to put down roots in a welcoming community. Otherwise, we’re in constant communication with leaders closer to the fight throughout the state to make sure we’re offering the most appropriate, proportional, and strategic help we can in our official capacity—such as when we adopted our 4th Amendment workplace resolution in partnership with Siembra NC.

5) The town has prioritized climate action and climate resiliency, but historic flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal shows that the town and its residents continue to be vulnerable to these disasters as climate change leads to more intense rainfall. How can Carrboro best help impacted residents and prepare for future disasters?

Our incredible Fire Chief and Emergency Manager Will Potter is already doing a great job helping to educate community members about the best ways to prepare at the individual level, so I think a lot of this work is underway, and we just need to continue to expand our outreach to make sure as many residents can get this information as possible. Outside of our official town offerings, I want to make sure as a leader I’m connecting with nonprofits, businesses, and grassroots organizers to form the less institutional community resilience that I think is a vital component for keeping us safe in the first 48-96 hours after these emergencies.

6) As with most places in the Triangle, Carrboro is grappling with a shortage of affordable housing. How effectively has the town helped address rising rents, particularly for low-income residents? How effectively has the town helped homeowners who were hit by this year’s property revaluation? What more should the town do to address housing affordability in the next few years?

Hopefully my extremely long-winded earlier answers cover a lot of what I think we can do better, but I do want to say briefly that I’m pleased that we’ve been able to assist the vast majority of tax-burdened residents who applied to our relief program. Another reason we need to increase our development of every kind in Carrboro is because our status quo places the entire burden of our town revenue on the backs of homeowners, which is increasingly untenable. As we increase our housing supply, explore novel and more impactful roads to subsidization, and expand our commercial tax base, we should be doing everything in our toolkit to slow the rise of rents, help more folks who need it find a home at lower than market rates, and slow the rate of expense on longtime property owners.

7) How should the Town of Carrboro encourage more walking, biking, and public transit use?

Would you believe that I think we need to add more housing, especially to our downtown area? The highest return we can get in terms of reducing car dependency is to make it possible for people to live where they need cars less, and at present our downtown area includes precious little housing, which our LUO and upcoming Downtown Area Plan should go a long way toward rectifying. Separately, we’re exploring some new tactics to make our bike and pedestrian projects more achievable—we’re really scrutinizing our workflows and considering the way we design and bid projects to make them more competitive for what state and federal money there is. Finally, an additional consideration for adding housing is that we need to add density to increase public transit service; Chapel Hill Transit is an incredible fare-free resource for a town like ours, but in order to make more service make more sense, we’ve got to make it possible for folks to live where the buses can serve. As we’re in partnership with Chapel Hill and UNC, who both naturally contribute more to our transit partnerships with their larger footprints, we need to build the density that makes it viable for us to increase our transit investment.

8) From cancelled grants to layoffs, federal funding cuts this year have hit the Triangle particularly hard and local government officials are having to make difficult decisions about what to fund and how. How should the town council prioritize competing funding needs? What role, if any, should the town play in supporting Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools in light of federal funding pressures?

While I’ve spent a good deal of ink and inches elsewhere lamenting the fact that Carrboro is so economically dependent on property taxes, perhaps the sole benefit our otherwise suboptimal economic composition provides is that we, as a town, are not dependent on federal funds in our regular operating budget. We do need to consider the scarcity of resources available for road, transit, and bike/ped projects, and I think the efficiency improvements I mentioned above to the way we fund the design phase of projects should help us to deliver the projects we can in this environment. As far as the schools, we’re incredibly invested in the success of CHCCS, and we’ll continue to be partners in the direct places we’re able—like the Safe Routes to School plans we coordinate on—but the scale of our operating budget and the separation of responsibilities from the County and the Board of Education mean that direct assistance beyond our residents’ contributions will probably not be in the form of revenue. As an individual leader, I’ll continue working with Board of Education members to stay responsive, flexible, and creative, to help Carrboro be the best partner we can feasibly be.

9) If there are other issues you want to discuss, please do so here.

My experience in my first term has been eye opening. I have spent a great deal of this questionnaire talking about land use because I think it’s vital that we use the tools of every office to get the results those tools can provide. But of course I recognize that these are somewhat limited answers to what most of the INDY’s readers are feeling in our increasingly frenetic, isolating age of rising fascism. I was extremely proud to be the first candidate endorsed by Democratic Socialists of America to win office in North Carolina, and I believe using the specific tools of my office to reduce capital’s influence in eroding our democracy is the best way I can serve working people in Carrboro and beyond. But it is not enough. The North Carolina General Assembly has been gerrymandered to such an extent as to functionally disenfranchise most of the INDY’s readers. Courts at every level have been packed with conservative activists, corporate apologists, and in the case of the North Carolina Supreme Court, literally the son of the North Carolina Senate President Pro-Tem, himself an instrumental figure in the gerrymandering in the first place. I note these conditions not to despair, but because I think anytime we consider electoral roles like mine, we need to consider their place in a vast power structure that needs everyone who reads this to get organized for the results they can get where they are. Join DSA—it is one of the few truly member-led democratic political organizations working across labor, climate, electoral, racial and gender solidarity issues. Organize your workplace—right now, white or blue collar, public or private sector: you are holding power that we need to put into the fight. If you need help, my contact info is on Carrboro’s website, and I’ll connect you however I can.

Holtec International described an “untenable path forward for used fuel storage in New Mexico” as it walked away from the proposal to temporarily hold spent fuel from commercial nuclear power plants across the nation. The New Jersey-based company confirmed its decision Thursday.

Holtec said the move would allow it to work with other states that are more amenable.

The New Mexico project was cast aside despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling in August that rebooted plans for temporary storage in Texas and New Mexico.

The U.S. is at an impasse over a permanent solution for storing spend nuclear fuel, as roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, pile up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.

U.S. nuclear regulators in 2023 licensed the proposed multibillion-dollar storage complex in New Mexico, while opposition persisted.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the Legislature put up stiff resistance with legislation that threatened to withhold state permits at least until a permanent storage solution is in place.

“It’s inappropriate to call anything ‘interim’ when you don’t have a permanent repository” for spent nuclear fuel, said Sen. Jeff Steinborn of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the bill.

He called Holtec’s decision to withdraw “a huge relief,” adding that “of course it’s still a national problem that needs to be solved.”

By contrast, Lujan Grisham’s Republican predecessor, Susana Martinez, had been supportive of the project. Holtec had argued the plan was safe and would be an economic boon for the region, without interfering with nearby oil development.

Critics of the project, including the Sierra Club, said Holtec’s decision highlights an enduring roadblock.

A separate resolution passed unanimously that urges all companies to discuss their plans to capture or sequester carbon in parish with the police jury’s CO2 Committee.","Police juries in Jeff Davis and Allen Parishes approved resolutions this week requesting that Gov. Jeff Landry grant local governments the authority to approve or deny Class VI CO2 injection wells within their jurisdictions. Class VI wells, used to inject carbon dioxide deep underground for long-term storage, are subject to the most stringent permitting requirements and have monitoring systems designed to protect underground sources of drinking water.

The Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy is currently reviewing 34 applications for Class Vi wells, which are located mostly in the southern and central parts of the state.

Environmental advocacy groups contend carbon leakages could potentially harm the Chicot Aquifer, the primary source of water in Jeff Davis and Allen parishes and other parishes in southeastern Louisiana.

The Louisiana CO2 Alliance, an advocacy group chaired by elected officials in Allen, Vernon, Jefferson Davis and Beauregard parishes, seeks a voice in crafting legislation that would address local concerns about carbon capture sequestration, as The Center Square reported in May.

In mid-September, the police jury in nearby Vernon Parish rescinded an ordinance expressing opposition to carbon sequestration projects that passed in 2024, according to a report by TV station by KALB. The jury also voted in September to pass a resolution limiting the issuance of permits on Class VI wells to give its members more time to understand safety issues. In another resolution, the police jury expressed support for industries that provide economic development to Vernon Parish, without regard to whether companies require carbon capture and sequestration in their operations.

Representatives of Highland Pellets, an Arkansas-based wood pellet manufacturer, spoke at the September meeting about the company’s plan to build a plant in the parish that would directly employ 100 to 200 people. The investment depends on the use of carbon capture sequestration, the company said.

Will Green, president and CEO of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry (LABI), said the state’s leaders must move quickly so that neighboring states, especially Texas, do not take the lead in establishing themselves as carbon sequestration hubs.

“LABI encourages all parish leaders to focus on the facts, not rhetoric from anti-business, out-of-state activist groups intent on preserving the status quo, and to weigh the long-term economic health of their communities,” Green said in a statement emailed to The Center Square. “Rejecting CCS could mean turning away jobs, growth, innovation and the chance to secure a stronger future for Louisiana.”

Carbon capture sequestration projects will typically generate $6 million to $12 million in local property taxes during the first five years of operation and $30 million over 20 years, according to a study done by the Center Emerging Energies cited by LABI.

The Allen Parish Police Jury voted unanimously Monday to ask Landry to refrain from issuing any Class VI carbon injection permits without prior approval from Allen Parish residents. A separate resolution passed unanimously that urges all companies to discuss their plans to capture or sequester carbon in parish with the police jury’s CO2 Committee.

A CO2 risk assessment commissioned by the police jury found a single carbon capture project would create over $81 million in local labor income over a 12-year period in Allen Parish while increasing gross domestic product (GDP) in the parish by $103 million.

The 151-page study done by Baton Rouge-based GEC found the fiscal impact for Allen Parish would include $3.5 million to $4.4 million in tax collections during 2026 through 2035. Additionally, lease payments for surface rights and pore space use have been agreed with landowners and could be substantial, according to GEC.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming.
Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue.
A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump's ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices ... and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

Existing power producers with spare capacity, including old coal plants set for retirement that suddenly have economic life left in them.","Visiting industry and finance customers in the US last week confirmed just how surging demand from hyperscalers is shaking up the US power industry, even beyond our initial take a year ago. WoodMac’s experts, Chris Seiple and Ben Hertz-Shargel, shared their latest thoughts.

How much power demand will data centres add?

Hyperscaler investment in data centres is accelerating rapidly. Spend for five of the biggest companies rose by a third in 2024 and is forecast to jump by 50% to over US$300 billion in 2025.

Our tracking shows US utilities have committed to add 116 GW of large loads to their networks, equivalent to approximately 20% of total US electricity demand in 2024. Vertical utilities are building all of the 16 GW under construction, while the rest is concentrated in two major power markets, PJM (the Mid-Atlantic region) and ERCOT (Texas). This is the tip of the iceberg, with an additional 32 GW that utilities are representing to investors as ‘high confidence’ of being built and a further 277 GW with an undisclosed commitment status.

Can the industry deliver sufficient supply to meet the demand?

That’s one of the big questions. There is plenty of political support, with the Trump administration determined that the US wins the battle with China for global AI leadership.

Ideally, large load customers want reliable, 24/7 low-carbon power. Renewables are the cheapest and most readily available resources, and variability can be mitigated when paired with energy storage. Nuclear and geothermal can contribute clean baseload power but are longer-term solutions.

The near-term focus, though, is on new-build gas-fired power plants to do the heavy lifting. The challenge here is a very tight supply chain, with gas turbines a critical bottleneck. GE Vernova has recently announced a 50% increase in turbine manufacturing capacity while Mitsubishi plans to double its capacity. But new orders still face at least a five-year wait for delivery.

Will power prices rise?

They’re already moving up. With supply chain constraints, including turbines, transformers and switchgear, demand growth looks certain to outstrip new supply in the next few years. There are also factors driving costs up that have nothing to do with data centres, including tariffs imposed on materials and components through the power value chain in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. We estimate the cost of new-build gas-fired plants has soared from US$1,400/kw four years ago to over US$2,400/kw today.

The wholesale power price in ERCOT, for example, needs to double to over US$100/MWh to incentivise the investment required for new-build combined-cycle gas turbine, even before any upside risk to Henry Hub gas prices is taken into account. The impact of rising wholesale prices on consumers will be compounded by higher transmission and distribution costs, including component inflation, as the network is strengthened to replace ageing components and for climate change-induced extreme weather. The price of pad mount single phase transformers, for example, has doubled since 2020.

How are power companies responding to higher demand?

It’s a challenge for a sector that’s just recently had a decade of no demand growth. The majority of data centres we are tracking that are under construction are being built in markets with regulated utilities. In the current power-scarce market, these one-stop shops that can build community support and provide power supply along with the grid connection are dominating new data centre capacity. Some data centre developers have pursued their own on-site generation to reduce their connection requests and speed time to power. This approach is still rare but will become more popular in the future and could include small nuclear and geothermal.

In the meantime, a bring-your-own-capacity movement has begun, calling for utilities to accelerate interconnection if the data centre company brings third-party generating capacity or demand-side resources, such as batteries and demand response. Google is promoting this model, alongside solution providers Cloverleaf Infrastructure, Voltus, Piclo and Camus Energy.

What are the risks to developers?

That they don’t recover the capital cost of their new capacity and are left with underused assets. The concern is that the current, bullish outlook for demand growth might prove a short-lived phenomenon if there’s a breakthrough on chip energy efficiency or less energy-intensive AI models or AI business models turn out to be not as profitable as anticipated. Utilities have started to insist on longer-duration contracts for large load buyers as a risk mitigation strategy. Contracts with large load buyers signed this year have typically been to supply power for 10 to 20 years, whereas in early 2024, few were longer than five years.

Will consumer bills increase?

Yes, and could become a political hot potato – “affordability” was the watchword among energy experts during New York Climate Week in September. A structural increase in wholesale prices will feed through into retail bills over time in deregulated retail markets and will come on top of record bill increases from the current heavy investment in strengthening the grid. State regulators approved US$29 billion in retail rate increases in H1 2025, more than double the same period in 2024.

The difficulty will be developing new utility cost recovery schemes that allocate exclusively to data centres the capital and operating costs that would normally be shared among all customers. One solution which many utilities are working on to protect retail customers’ bills are discrete tariffs for hyperscalers, which reflect the cost of dedicated generation and the associated transmission costs. While many utilities are moving in this direction, there’s a wide variety of approaches.

Who are the winners?

Regulated utilities that provide data centres with certainty of power through grid access. Existing power producers with spare capacity, including old coal plants set for retirement that suddenly have economic life left in them. And a large prize waits for the companies first able to develop cost effective solutions for off grid projects, which are currently proving too expensive and running into engineering challenges.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/environmental-social-and-governance/micro-esg/micro_esg_gettyimages-157366413.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-10-09 20:01:21.726764

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices ... and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

The Senate approved three resolutions this week that wipe out resource management plans enacted during the Biden administration in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.
The resolutions came under the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Congress to nullify executive branch rules.
These plans had never before been considered rules, which is a requirement for eligibility under the Congressional Review Act.
“You see Congress potentially going down a path of micromanaging all the resource management plans in the country,” Hamby said.","Congress took the unprecedented step this week of repealing management plans for public lands in three states in an effort to expand access to fossil fuel mining and drilling.

Critics of the move warn it could inject a new level of uncertainty into management of these areas and open a wave of litigation over leasing for energy development, grazing and other uses.

The Senate approved three resolutions this week that wipe out resource management plans enacted during the Biden administration in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota. The resolutions came under the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Congress to nullify executive branch rules. Each resolution had previously passed the House of Representatives.

The Biden-era plans had ended coal leasing in the prolific Powder River Basin and limited access to oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands compared to previous plans.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who sponsored one of the resolutions, said in a Wednesday speech celebrating the vote that the Biden-era plan was enacted despite opposition from local communities and officials, and called it “an attack on Montana jobs” and “on Montana communities.”

Daines also rejected the notion that the resolution would cause chaos, arguing that it simply repealed the Biden administration’s latest amendment to the management plan while leaving the rest of the plan in place.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a sponsor of the bill covering that state’s plan, said in a statement that the Bureau of Land Management had violated its obligation to balance multiple uses of the land by all but eliminating coal leasing.

Democrats voted against the measures, and conservation groups have said the repeal will threaten conservation gains made after years of painstaking work, including protections for caribou, Dall sheep and salmon in Alaska.

The Bureau of Land Management uses resource management plans to set parameters for how to balance multiple uses on public lands, including energy development, grazing, conservation and recreation. The plans are usually in place for years, and can take years to develop, incorporating input from numerous stakeholders, said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.

These plans had never before been considered rules, which is a requirement for eligibility under the Congressional Review Act. Now that lawmakers have taken this step, some legal experts have warned it could open up hundreds of plans for review.

Hamby warned that applying the Congressional Review Act would open what is normally a slow, deliberative process to the whims of Congress and partisan swings.

“You see Congress potentially going down a path of micromanaging all the resource management plans in the country,” Hamby said.

On Wednesday, lawmakers from Wyoming introduced a resolution to repeal a resource management plan for that state.

In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) warned that the resolutions could cast doubt on resource plans across the country. Because other existing management plans have not been submitted to Congress as rules, he said, it could now be possible to argue that all of the plans enacted since the Congressional Review Act was passed, in 1996, are technically not in effect.

“And if they never went into effect, then all of the leases, and permits and rights of way that flow from those plans may not be legally valid,” Heinrich said.

Because the Congressional Review Act prohibits agencies from adopting rules that are “substantially the same” as what has been repealed, it also injects uncertainty into how future management plans can be shaped, Hamby said.

A group of legal experts wrote to Congress last month warning that using the Congressional Review Act on the plans could open up an “endless cycle of litigation.”

The Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies in Western states, praised the passage of the North Dakota resolution, which it said would have the most significant impact on its members. “The Senate resolution is a welcome step that will bring more certainty to energy development and other multiple uses on public lands managed by BLM,” said Melissa Simpson, the group’s president, in a written statement.

Aaron Johnson, the Western Energy Alliance’s vice president of public and legislative affairs, dismissed the concern that repealing the plans would cause legal chaos, saying it will simply revert them to the previous versions.

Hamby said the move could come back to harm some of the interests these resolutions were meant to support, by opening up any leases offered under the now-repealed plans to legal challenges.

“I would not be surprised if we see something like that soon,” Hamby said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2236770251-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 19:03:03.283151

The end of the federal incentive dealt a blow to the burgeoning EV market, which had seen U.S. sales grow from around 233,000 units in 2020 to more than 1.5 million units in 2024. But the effort falls short of a death knell, as adoption rates continue to increase despite the administration’s efforts to stifle it. According to Grand View Research, the global EV market is forecast to undergo a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.5% between 2025 and 2030. And while the Asia Pacific region represents the largest market in the world, the U.S. EV market is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR through the start of the next decade.

So it’s little surprise that legacy automakers like and have found a loophole that allows them to directly offer consumers the same $7,500 incentive that the federal government’s now-expired EV tax credit once did.

Legacy Automakers Forge Their Own Path Forward… With a Catch

Knowing the EV tax credit’s expiration was looming, Ford and took proactive measures in advance of the Sept. 30 deadline that have allowed the two companies to continue offering customers a price break.

By working within IRS guidelines for clean vehicle tax credits, the financing departments of Ford and GM made down payments on EVs prior to the expiration date. In turn, those savings are allowed to be passed on to buyers for EVs that are either already on dealership lots or were in transit. According to the IRS, those down payments were enough to satisfy the tax credit requirements with the agency.

However, there’s a catch. Even though it isn’t necessary for consumers to take possession of their EVs prior to the Sept. 30 deadline, because it was necessary for dealerships to have done so, the offer is only available for pre-qualified leased EVs. Separately, there is a $4,000 tax credit available for qualifying used EVs.

According to Ford Credit, the company’s financing arm, these offers will be available until Dec. 31. Importantly, while this appears to be a stopgap measure, it demonstrates a commitment by the two largest U.S. automakers to transform their product lines of EVs.

Both Companies Are Heavily Invested in the EV Transition

While the efforts to extend the tax credit savings to customers may be temporary, both Ford and GM have an eye on the future, and that future is decidedly electric.

Ford has committed $5 billion to a multi-pronged approach to electrification of its fleet. That involves investments in 4,000 American jobs at the Louisville Assembly Plant and BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan to deliver a new EV pickup and produce advanced prismatic LFP batteries.

Additionally, the plan entails the Ford Universal EV platform, which aims to produce a family of affordable EVs produced at scale, with over-the-air updates for perpetual vehicle improvement. The first vehicle in that class will be a midsized, four-door electric pickup with a targeted MSRP of around $30,000, which Ford says should reach customers by 2027.

The company is also investing in an improved assembly line—the Ford Universal EV Production System—the goal of which is “radically simplifying vehicle assembly for safety, quality, and speed.”

For its part, GM is planning on investing $4 billion over the next two years into expanding both its EV conversion and increasing production of its internal combustion engine vehicle line.

That plan includes transitioning its factory in Detroit-Hamtramck—rebranded as Factory ZERO—to 100%.

At that plant, GM will only produce EVs, beginning with the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC Sierra EV, Cadillac Escalade IQ, and GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.

What Does That Mean for Investors?

In the near-term, the two companies’ capex toward the EV transition will have little to negative impacts. Long-term, that picture will very likely look different. But Wall Street is tepid in its analysis, with Ford’s average one-year price target 13% lower than today’s share price, and GM’s average one-year price target just 8% higher than today’s share price.

For investors following the money, GM appears to have an edge with 93% institutional ownership versus Ford’s 58% institutional ownership. Given that GM is now the second largest manufacturer of EVs in the United States with Q2 EV sales up 111% year-over-year, accounting for 16% of the U.S. EV market, the smart money might be on to something.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 22:00:27.937658

“As the economy electrifies and more electrons flow through the grid, capital expenditures will be distributed across a larger base, driving down costs for everyone,” it noted.
The report also suggests the industry’s capital allocation priorities have again shifted markedly toward power generation.
The approach reflects a comprehensive system upgrade required to accommodate both increased power flows and changing generation patterns.","America’s investor-owned electric companies are poised to deploy record-breaking investment to launch one of the most aggressive infrastructure modernization campaigns in industry history in a bid to confront unprecedented electricity demand growth and prepare for a fundamentally transformed energy landscape.

In total, over the next five years, the industry is poised to invest more than $1.1 trillion to enhance and expand the grid, according to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a trade group that represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies. That represents an unprecedented accelerated investment pace. By comparison, industry deployed $1.3 trillion over the past 10 years, the research released on Oct. 7 says.

“EEI member companies are on pace to invest nearly $208 billion this year to make the energy grid smarter, stronger, more efficient, and more secure,” the analysis notes. The investment is a direct response to rising demand for energy. Last year, power generation in the U.S. jumped 3% to reach 4,304,038 GWh—marking the “largest annual jump in years,” it notes. By 2030, U.S. electricity generation could soar to more than 4,500,000 GWh and surpass 5,400,000 GWh by 2040, which would mark an average annual growth of 1.7%.

The injection of investment will bolster construction of “more energy- and cost-efficient infrastructure” to meet surging electricity demand,” EEI said. “As the economy electrifies and more electrons flow through the grid, capital expenditures will be distributed across a larger base, driving down costs for everyone,” it noted. EEI added that “these investments will ensure reliability and enable companies to provide electricity at the lowest-possible cost for customers.”

Investment Priorities May Be Shifting Back Toward Power Generation

The scale of planned system expansion also defies historical precedent. EEI suggests 91 GW of new generating capacity is currently under construction, and an additional 488 GW is planned or has been proposed for the next five years. “For comparison, the grid currently has approximately 1,250 GW of capacity,” the report notes. Combined, the 579-GW pipeline represents 46.3% of the nation’s existing grid capacity, and it potentially positions utilities to expand the power system by nearly half its current size within the next half-decade.

The report also suggests the industry’s capital allocation priorities have again shifted markedly toward power generation. While generation investments have represented a rising share of total capital expenditures for four consecutive years, the shift marks a definitive pivot from the previous decade’s emphasis on transmission and distribution modernization, as utilities confront the immediate need for new generating resources to meet exploding demand.

The data show generation spending has nearly doubled since 2020, rising from 24% to 30% of total capex, reflecting a decisive pivot to new power supply amid surging load growth from electrification, AI, and industrial expansion.

Distribution infrastructure, however, continues commanding the largest investment category within the projected $207.9 billion in functional capital expenditures for 2025, followed by transmission, generation, and gas-related infrastructure investments. The approach reflects a comprehensive system upgrade required to accommodate both increased power flows and changing generation patterns.

A Historic Infrastructure Pipeline Is Emerging

As a whole, total spending by investor-owned utilities is projected to reach $207.9 billion in 2025, up from $139.8 billion in 2020—a nearly 50% increase in five years. For now, distribution is set to remain the single largest spending category, accounting for about one-third ($66.5 billion) of this year’s total, while generation surges to 30% ($62.4 billion)—its highest share in more than a decade. Transmission, meanwhile, will make up roughly 18% ($37 billion), followed by gas-related infrastructure at 14% ($29 billion) and other investments at 6% ($12 billion).

EEI notes that while the gas-related infrastructure category covers natural gas delivery and pipeline infrastructure, it does not cover gas-fired electric generation. While gas infrastructure’s share has remained relatively stable over the past decade, total gas-related investment has grown by nearly 22% since 2020, likely to improve safety, resilience, and efficiency. But investment also likely supports the industry’s broader grid reliability goals, particularly given that many utilities rely on natural gas networks for winter peak supply and to balance intermittent renewable generation.

The historic surge in capital spending follows decades of incremental, maintenance-driven investment that plugged critical gaps without realigning the grid’s interconnected layers. As POWER reported in its detailed June 2025 feature (“Out of Sync: The Infrastructure Misalignment Undermining the U.S. Grid”), the U.S. power system has long relied on piecemeal upgrades—patching aging lines, retrofitting equipment, and adding local projects in isolation—while generation, transmission, and distribution evolved on disconnected timelines under fragmented regulation.

That reactive approach has left the grid misaligned. POWER found that without a coordinated, systemwide vision that synchronizes planning, permitting, and financing across all assets, investment—even if unprecedented—risks entrenching these structural mismatches rather than resolving them.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/eeiexenditures2015-2029.png,N,,2025-10-09 18:03:33.368217

Energy is now a strategic priority: Reshoring manufacturers must treat energy planning as key to cost, resilience, and sustainability.

Policy shifts require flexibility: Evolving federal energy priorities make tailored, jurisdiction-aware strategies essential.

Plan early and strategically: Each energy option — RECs, PPAs, or on-site generation — carries long-term legal and financial implications.

As manufacturers accelerate plans to re-shore operations to the U.S., energy strategy has become one of the most material and multidimensional issues in the facility planning process. For energy-intensive industries, power procurement isn’t just a line item on the budget or a utility concern — it’s a strategic input with legal, financial, and operational implications.

This importance is amplified by today’s political and regulatory uncertainty. The Trump administration has already made significant changes to the energy landscape, and has signaled that more is to come. This could mean different priorities for decarbonization, incentives for renewables, or permitting rules for fossil fuel projects and transmission lines.

These shifting priorities directly affect how manufacturers evaluate energy options — especially when long-term investments are at stake. Manufacturers must take a more strategic and tailored approach to energy planning to ensure operational goals and cost structure for decades.

Features of Energy for Manufacturing

Manufacturers’ energy needs are different than many other types of commercial operations:

Load Size: Manufacturing operations, in particular heavy manufacturing, often have relatively large loads. This opens additional supply avenues to manufacturers, and provides market leverage.

Load Profile: Manufacturing operations have relatively consistent and predictable energy needs, particularly facilities that operate multiple shifts.

Long horizons: Manufacturing facilities are long-lived assets. This allows manufacturers to make energy decisions over decades instead of months.

Consistency and uptime: Energy interruptions mean costly facility downtime. For some manufacturers, energy interruptions mean damage to inventory or equipment, and protection against energy interruption is of paramount importance.

Process Steam: Some manufacturing operations also require thermal energy, process steam, or similar non-electric energy inputs. Such requirements will substantially limit the available energy supply options. Here, we will focus on electric-only load requirements.

For manufacturers, energy supply is on par with labor availability and similar operational planning. In some sectors, energy considerations even outweigh traditional factors like real estate cost or proximity to suppliers. Energy should be an intentional operational opportunity to align with long-term cost, sustainability, and resilience goals.

Four Strategic Energy Goals

Manufacturers’ energy strategies balance some combination of four competing energy goals:

Reducing total energy costs, particularly in price-sensitive or energy-intensive sectors.

Price predictability, to support long-term financial planning.

“Greening” the energy supply, for ESG or regulatory reasons. For some products and jurisdictions, a sufficiently green energy supply may also extend “green” benefits to the manufacturer’s products.

Interruption protection, to avoid operational losses and liabilities.

No energy strategy can perfectly achieve all of these goals simultaneously, however. Choices and compromises must be made.

Energy Management Approaches

With competing energy goals in play, manufacturers should evaluate available management approaches which vary in complexity, commitment, and impact.

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). While technically not energy, RECs are a straightforward tool for achieving energy greening goals. The manufacturer buys energy from the grid (or any other source), and separately purchase RECs in the desired amounts. This allows the manufacturer to offset the emissions from purchased energy.

Pros: Low cost; limited commitment; easy to execute; no physical facility required.

Cons: Increases overall energy cost; does not contribute towards goals other than greening.

Use case: Companies needing quick ESG reporting solutions or early-stage green targets.

Offsite Power Purchase (Virtual or Physical Delivery). With this approach, the manufacturer signs an agreement with the owner of a power plant not co-located with the manufacturing facility, and the remote power plant supplies energy to the manufacturing facility. This energy will reduce the amount of energy purchased from the local utility. These long-term financial contracts allow manufacturers to lock in their energy cost long-term.

Pros: May provide overall cost reduction, price certainty, and energy greening; no local construction required.

Cons: Potentially long-term commitment; limited availability in fully-regulated energy markets; does not provide interruption protection; remote supply may not provide energy greening in all circumstances.

Use case: Sophisticated buyers with strong legal/financial teams.

On-Site Energy Facility. An energy facility constructed at or adjacent to the manufacturing facility can provide energy generation, energy storage, or both.

Pros: Strong alignment with all four goals; physical interruption protection available.

Cons: Requires land, capital, and time for development and construction; long-term commitment.

Use case: Long-term manufacturing facilities with access to land or favorable permitting regimes; manufacturing facilities that require interruption protection.

Microgrids. Self-contained energy systems that can island from the grid offer resilience and autonomy. Microgrids combine multiple generation and storage solutions to maximize control of energy supply.

Pros: Resilience; price control; custom design.

Cons: High operational complexity; regulatory hurdles; redundancy/oversupply may be required.

Use case: Mission-critical manufacturing; remote or off-grid locations.

Choosing a Path: Legal and Operational Considerations

No matter the technology, key decision parameters should guide manufacturers’ energy planning:

Setup time – Strategies that require energy plant development/construction generally take longer than strategies involving only contractual arrangements. Technologies require differing lead times.

Commitment Duration – Most of the options discussed require long-term commitment, but the duration of that commitment can vary significantly depending on technology and structure selections. Factor those timelines into your choice.

Financial and Contractual Terms – The contracts involved in energy planning can be complex, and the specific terms can vary significantly. Evaluation of financial and contractual details should be considered early in the process.

Regulatory Considerations – Energy generation and transmission is highly regulated everywhere, but there is still significant variation across jurisdictions. The process, structure, terms, and even availability of both on-site and off-site solutions will be subject to and limited by local/regional rules.

Siting and Permitting – Local zoning and environmental rules can change the cost/benefit analysis for various energy strategies, and in some cases may limit available on-site options.

Manufacturers planning new or expanded U.S. operations should take an informed, flexible, and jurisdiction-aware approach to energy. Navigating energy strategies involves considering long-term commitments, regulatory landscapes, and financial and operational considerations. With proper planning, manufacturers can align their energy strategies with broader business objectives, ensuring operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability in an unpredictable energy landscape.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14205_3939.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 21:59:44.125709

More specifically, the upcoming 2027 Chevrolet Bolt will take the prize as the first American-made EV to start below $30,000 — almost $10,000 under the cheapest Tesla. While questions remain around just how reliable EVs are as everyday vehicles, there's no doubt that one of the biggest pain points of adoption is how much many of these ""environmentally friendly"" vehicles cost.

One way to offset that cost used to be the federal EV tax credits, which Americans could take advantage of to effectively cut the price of a EV by up to $7,500. However, the Trump administration killed off the tax credit after taking office earlier this year — just one of several sweeping changes that Trump and his team have made since taking over the government again.

The Bolt has always been marketed as an affordable EV, even when we last reviewed one back in 2022. Despite its affordability, GM temporarily ended production of the Bolt in 2023. That didn't last long, though, as the company later announced the Bolt would make a comeback. Now we know what that comeback looks like, as the 2027 Chevy Bolt will be the cheapest American-made EV on the market.

According to Car and Driver, the 2027 Bolt will start at $29,990 when it launches in 2026. The low price will come with some concessions as GM has noted it won't support CarPlay or Android Auto. That said, Google's infotainment system will be built in, so drivers can still access Google Maps, HBO Max, and other apps. If you aren't as concerned about staying under $30,000, there will be a sportier RS trim available for $32,995. A base 1LT model is expected a few months later as well, which will start at $28,995.

The important thing to note here is that these prices also include destination charges. Other EVs, like the Nissan Leaf, have previously debuted for under that $30,000 mark, but those prices haven't included destination charges. Destination charges are usually non-negotiable charges passed on to the customer to help cover the cost of moving the vehicles from the factory to the lot where they're purchased.

The notices said EPA could no longer incur “further financial obligations” and “a number of EPA employees will be placed in a furlough status.”

How many EPA employees have been furloughed so far is not clear. The agency didn’t answer questions about the number of staffers being sent home or whether EPA had exhausted its available funds to stay open.

EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the agency was operating according to its shutdown or “lapse” plan. Under that plan, once carryover funds expire, EPA could furlough more than 13,000 employees until the shutdown ends.

Multiple EPA employees, who have been granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, said they’ve been told this is the first phase of furloughs at the agency. But details have been sparse, leaving employees in a new phase of limbo.

Since the shutdown began last week, EPA staffers have been reporting to work as usual. Exemption notices sent to many employees, potentially the entire staff, gave no timeline on when furloughs would start.

EPA’s largest union denounced staff being furloughed.

“Furloughing EPA employees is not just an attack on federal workers, but an attack on every American’s right to clean air, safe water, and uncontaminated soil,” said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, in a statement.

Chen added, “When the essential services that EPA workers provide stop, that means pollution monitoring, toxic cleanup, and other public health protections stall and communities suffer.”

The union leader also took issue with the White House questioning whether furloughed government workers would receive back pay once the funding lapse ends. EPA’s own guidance indicates they will be paid in accordance with a law President Donald Trump signed after the 2019 shutdown (see related story).

“Now President Trump is adding insult to injury by threatening to withhold guaranteed pay for furloughed employees, a move that is not only disgusting, but illegal,” Chen said.

EPA employees took note of the administration’s threats, including issuing a reduction in force, or RIF, during the shutdown. One agency staffer said they didn’t appreciate the president’s intent “to defy the law and deny us back pay or lay people off.”

“But I honestly think federal workers are so traumatized that the threats mostly just bounce off us at this point,” the EPA employee said.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives, a spokesperson said.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. It is unclear why Ford canceled its program.

Ford and GM developed their strategies after discussions with officials at the Internal Revenue Service, Reuters previously reported.

Some auto executives, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, have warned that EV sales will drop significantly in the absence of the credit. Other automotive leaders, such as the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, have affirmed that the electric vehicle market is more resilient than that.

Unsurprisingly, Trump’s DOE targeted the cuts towards projects in districts held by Democrats - 4:1 by total dollar amount.

This week, it was revealed that the DOE is looking at another tranche of cuts - this time with Republican districts on the block. So what’s at stake here? The answer is $15.5 billion in federal government spending, another $13.3 billion in state matching funding, and an extraordinary amount of private investment that’s likely to get wiped out overnight.

We’ve pulled together the cancellations into a visualization that illustrates just how rough these cuts are going to be for nascent industries - and well established ones too. We took the reported list of awards, and pulled up their records (although as of this writing, the records from the first tranche of projects have already been expunged from USAspending).

The largest sets of cuts are from the offices of Clean Energy Demonstration ($4.44 billion) and Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program ($4.03 billion). Clean Energy Demonstration is a program funded under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and has largely spurred major US industries to look for improvements in their manufacturing processes. Programs funded under the OCED included low emissions cement manufacture, clean steel, and advanced chemical manufacturing. The Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program was spurred through the Inflation Reduction Act, and is largely geared towards improving the supply chain of critical minerals, battery production, and parts manufacturing for electric vehicles.

Also on the chopping block are key projects from the Grid Deployment Office ($3.29 billion), a BIL program meant to help both big utilities and state and local authorities buff up aging transmission systems through cutting edge technology improvements; and programs funded by the Office of Fossil Energy ($1.97 billion), the group in charge of the vaunted hydrogen hubs and carbon capture projects. Another $1.69 billion in cuts are being made to the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, almost all of which are innovative projects by small and medium industries to make big steps forward in improving their own processes and reducing cost, or to state academic institutions for industrial research and development.

Some of the largest project cuts target electric vehicle manufacturers, battery producers, and critical minerals processing. General Motors in Michigan is losing $500 million in federal investment to spur new electric motor factories in Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is losing $530 million in federal investment for electric vehicle factories in Illinois and Indiana. Mercedes in South Carolina ($285 million), Volvo in North Carolina ($208 million), and even Harley Davidson in Pennsylvania ($89 million) are all being slashed.

But it’s not just electric vehicles. Batteries, used in cars, industries, houses, and consumer goods - as well as by utilities - are being cut with big losses for lithium processing in Nevada ($123 million), cathode production in Kentucky ($316 million), and graphite manufacturing in South Carolina ($150 million).

Some of the most innovative manufacturing processes are also being cut. A massive investment in clean steel is on the block in Louisiana (Vale, $283 million), a brand new advanced concrete production facility in Indiana (Heidelberg, $500 million), and a solar/storage facility that would have reduced the cost of gold mining in Nevada (Nevada Gold, $95 million) are now out the window as well.

These projects are critical not only to the communities and jobs that they serve, but are core to a robust supply chain to keep prices - and emissions - low for consumers and businesses. This kind of federal funding is the stuff that actually makes things work. Investments in our economy drive new industries, drive American innovation, and keep our economy competitive. Slashing these programs is a relatively small short-term gain for a huge long-term loss.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-10/screenshot-2025-10-09-at-4.17.19-pm.png.webp?itok=7d6j9pbT,N,,2025-10-09 19:03:37.910895

How to revive community solar growth A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.","The future of community solar is dimming, hampered by federal attacks on clean energy and shifts in state markets.

Installations of the shared-solar approach took a nosedive in the first half of 2025, dropping by 36% from the same period last year, according to a new report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Working in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access, an industry trade group, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that by the end of 2025, installations will fall by 29% from 2024’s record high of 1.7 gigawatts. According to the analysis, growth will likely contract by an average of about 12% annually through 2030.

“I’m dismayed by this report,” said John Farrell, co-director of the research and advocacy nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ​“Of the places where we have policies [that drive community solar], it looks like things are slowing down.”

Why community solar is buckling despite its benefits

Community solar makes clean power accessible to those who can’t put solar panels on their roofs — be it because they rent, can’t afford them, or have other reasons. Households can subscribe to a share of an off-site array, which is typically 2 to 20 megawatts, per the report, to get credit for the power and save on their energy bills. Third-party developers usually build and own these installations — not utilities.

About 9.1 gigawatts of shared solar have been installed in the U.S. to date, according to the report’s authors. They expect community solar capacity to reach roughly 16 GWby 2030.

The megabill that Republicans passed in July is a major reason for the community solar market’s shake-up. The law set an early expiration date for a key tax credit worth 30% to 50% of the cost of a project. Developers once had until 2034 to claim it; now companies must either start construction by July 2026 and finish within four years or start producing power by the end of 2027.

Because of the law’s passage, Wood Mackenzie slashed its community solar figures through 2030 by about 8%, or 655 megawatts, from its prior forecast, said Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at the firm and lead author of the report.

But factors at the state level are also contributing to the slowdown. In particular, New York and Maine are driving the steep decline.

Developers in New York, a mature market, are having trouble finding sites, paying higher permitting and land costs, and having to wait an average of nearly three years to get connected to the grid, making projects more expensive to develop, Connelly said.

Meanwhile, in Maine, two regulatory changes are at play. Last year saw record growth as developers sprinted to get projects done by the December phaseout of the state’s net metering program, leading to fewer in the pipeline now, Connelly noted. In June, legislators also passed a bill that retroactively overhauled compensation for community solar power and added fees for new and established projects. The industry has said these provisions will make the state a ​“pariah for investors.”

Some states, such as Virginia and New Mexico, also have caps on the size of their community solar programs that are limiting new developments, according to Connelly.

And more federal turbulence could be ahead.

The Trump administration is also trying to claw back funding that would’ve supported solar: the $7 billion Solar for All program and the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, programs passed under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.

“The impact of [losing] Solar for All is one that we are tracking closely,” Connelly said, as the move could stymie community solar in places where it’s just getting off the ground.

While this year is likely to be a rough one for community solar, Connelly sees growth returning in 2026 and 2027. This is in part due to rebounds in Massachusetts and New Jersey, both of which are transitioning into new iterations of existing programs.

Public advocate praises new net energy billing reform law that could save ratepayers money

Massachusetts will open up its Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program, SMART3.0, to developers on October 15. And New Jersey recently eliminated a 150-megawatt annual cap and unlocked a whopping 3 gigawatts of community solar capacity.

But that growth is just a temporary reprieve. Over the longer term, the forecast shows community solar installations trending down.

How to revive community solar growth

A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.

For one, if states were to start new community solar programs, as well as address interconnection bottlenecks, they could drive up to 1.3 gigawatts of additional capacity through 2030, according to the report. But ​“we don’t really see any new programs opening up, at least in the near term,” Connelly said. ​“Policymakers have made a lot of progress in some state markets over the last six months to a year, but the difficulty is getting that legislation over the finish line.”

In deep red Montana, for example, legislators approved a new community solar program, with 100 in favor and 50 opposed, underscoring the model’s growing appeal to Republicans. But Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) vetoed the bill, claiming that it could result in ​“unreasonable costs” being foisted on other energy customers.

Only 24 states plus Washington, D.C., have passed community solar legislation as of February, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Iowa are all considering shared-solar bills, said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

Other states could be tempted to authorize a flood of clean, cheap solar power. The grid is facing soaring demand from data centers, electric vehicles, buildings, and manufacturing, and distributed community solar is among the fastest options to deploy.

“If you want to build a new gas plant right now, you’re going to need five-plus years minimum to do it. You want to build a new utility-scale [solar or wind] facility — at least five years as well, and that’s pending the development of new transmission,” Cramer said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0370-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:03:18.495206

The building joins others that Amazon has used mass timber to build, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia.","Amazon has completed a mass timber warehouse in Indiana, USA, which the company says will be used as a testbed for ""over 40 sustainability strategies"" to implement in existing and future buildings.

Located in Elkhart, the DII5 warehouse is primarily made of mass timber and was designed by design architect ZGF Architects with elements such as clerestory windows, circadian lighting, and EV charging stations as part of the company's goal of reaching net zero operations by 2024.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardization of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" Amazon vice president of global realty Daniel Mallory told Dezeen.

""At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing, and resilient in a changing climate. The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction, and operation of our spaces.""

According to the company, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"" and the project is aiming to achieve Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification.

It encompasses one large delivery building surrounded by a site that includes elements such as permeable paving, ""lower carbon concrete"", high-efficiency outdoor lighting and a bio-rentention pond for stormwater management.

The building itself was made using Southern Yellow Pine CLT panels and glulam beams, as well as wood fibre insulation.

Its celestory windows, which line the delivery floor, ""bathe the interior in sunshine"", according to Amazon.

""From the moment you approach and enter Amazon's new delivery station you know you're somewhere special,"" said the company. ""This is indeed a new kind of delivery station.""

Mallory says the company will track the performance of the building and implement successful features in other Amazon buildings.

""We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,"" he said.

""We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

The building joins others that Amazon has used mass timber to build, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia. The company notes several of its buildings have achieved Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification, including warehouses in Australia and one in the UK.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio,"" said Mallory.

""If certain features don't perform as expected or cannot be implemented in certain existing facilities, that information will be valuable in refining our approach to our future sustainable building design.""

Some of the company's sustainability claims have received criticism in the past. Last year, the New York Times reported that despite claims it had reached its green energy goals, some groups raised concern over a reliance on renewable energy certificates, though Amazon disputed these criticisms.

Elsewhere in Indiana, concerns have been raised about the extensive energy usage of its AI processing facility. Some reports claim Amazon's greenhouse gas emissions rose by 6 per cent in 2024.

While the company recently completed phase one of its HQ2 project, the second phase of the project previously came under fire for its proposed, spiralled Helix building, which drew public comparisons to an ice-cream scoop and poop emoji. Construction on the second phase of the project is currently paused.

It also updated its logo earlier this year.

The Serentica investment represents a strategic move to expand this renewable energy portfolio and ensure long-term energy cost stability for the company's manufacturing operations.
MRF's renewable energy push follows similar moves by other major Indian tyre manufacturers.
JK Tyre has already achieved 53% renewable energy in its operations and targets 75% within five years.","India's leading tyre manufacturer MRF Limited has announced a strategic investment of ₹99 crores to acquire a 26% stake in Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, marking the company's significant entry into renewable energy sector. This move represents MRF's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing sustainable manufacturing practices as the automotive industry transitions toward cleaner energy solutions.

The Chennai-based tyre giant will invest ₹99 crores through cash consideration to acquire up to 26% equity stake in Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, a company incorporated on May 5, 2025. The deal includes a power supply and consumption agreement for solar and wind power under the government's captive power policy, with completion expected by July 31, 2026.

Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, headquartered in Gurugram, operates as a developer in build, own, operate, maintain and manage hydel, solar, wind, geothermal, energy storage and other alternate energy sources. Since the company was recently incorporated, it has not commenced commercial operations yet.

This renewable energy investment aligns with MRF's broader sustainability strategy as the company faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions across its 10 manufacturing facilities in India. The tyre manufacturer has already committed to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by FY2050, with an interim target of 25% reduction in emission intensity by FY2028.

Currently, renewable energy contributes 12% to MRF's overall electricity consumption through renewable power purchase agreements. The Serentica investment represents a strategic move to expand this renewable energy portfolio and ensure long-term energy cost stability for the company's manufacturing operations.

The captive power arrangement will provide MRF with direct access to clean energy under the group captive generation mechanism outlined in the Electricity Act, allowing the company to meet at least 51% of its power requirements from the jointly-owned renewable facility.

While carbon credits could provide additional revenue streams, MRF's investment appears driven by multiple strategic factors beyond carbon monetization. The primary motivation centres on energy security and cost management, as captive renewable power plants typically offer 20-25 years of predictable energy costs compared to volatile grid tariffs.

The investment also positions MRF to meet India's Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) while supporting the country's net-zero emissions target by 2070. This regulatory compliance aspect has become increasingly important as environmental norms tighten across industrial sectors.

MRF's renewable energy push follows similar moves by other major Indian tyre manufacturers. Competitor JK Tyre became India's first tyre company to join the RE100 initiative, committing to 100% renewable electricity by 2050. JK Tyre has already achieved 53% renewable energy in its operations and targets 75% within five years.

As we seek to help lift people out of poverty by giving them access to better jobs, energy has become one of the critical levers for change.
We know that affordable and reliable electricity is key for firms seeking to scale operations more efficiently in the region.
In Senegal, the Energy Access and Scale-Up Project aims to bring electricity to 600 health clinics, 200 schools, 700 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 200,000 households.
This expansion is creating jobs through installation, maintenance, and electrification supply chains while improving productivity in education, health care, and small businesses.","Over the past 150 years, leaps in energy technology and availability around the world have made numerous jobs easier, faster, or even obsolete. Think of laundromats replacing laundresses, automation and robots taking the place of workers in assembly lines, and now artificial intelligence-assisted chatbots replacing customer service agents.

The same is true in Africa, but the shift is happening at a much slower pace. In a region where roughly 600 million people still lack access to electricity and many industries are being held back by unreliable or unaffordable electricity, access to energy holds the power to transform economies, increase incomes, and reshape the employment environment for the better.

That is good news for Africa, as the job landscape urgently needs to be disrupted. Across the region, informal and subsistence work still employs the majority of working-age Africans, leaving too many families vulnerable to poverty. Most earn a living through self-employment or micro-businesses, which offer limited scope for investment and growth. Only a small share of workers have access to formal, wage-paying jobs.

Many conditions are necessary for firms to grow and hire better skilled workers, from a conducive business environment to regulatory stability and access to large, attractive markets. But infrastructure, especially access to energy, is a strikingly important ingredient.

It’s no accident that the World Bank Group has made Mission 300, our initiative to provide electricity to 300 million people in Africa by 2030, so central to our work. As we seek to help lift people out of poverty by giving them access to better jobs, energy has become one of the critical levers for change.

We know that affordable and reliable electricity is key for firms seeking to scale operations more efficiently in the region. High electricity costs undermine the competitiveness of private sector firms, often forcing them to rely on manual processes instead of adopting high productivity technologies that require more energy. Unreliable power also remains a major challenge, with blackouts causing major disruptions to business activity and reducing employment rates by an estimated 5 to 14 percentage points.

Firms operating in sectors such as agribusiness, light manufacturing, mining, housing and construction, health care, and tourism could greatly boost productivity through more intensive energy use. (You can find deep dives into the job potential of each of these sectors in the October 2025 edition of Africa’s Pulse.) In health care, for instance, rapid advances in imaging and monitoring require reliable energy and skilled labor to use these technologies. Similarly, tourism depends heavily on modern amenities, including readily available phone charging, Wi-Fi access, and air conditioning. When it comes to temperature control, the largest projected economic impact from climate change on the region—even greater than flooding and droughts—is expected to come from heat stress on workers, making cooling systems essential for employers.

Given how critical energy access is to job creation in the region, the World Bank has committed to leveraging $30 billion in resources from our International Development Association (IDA) over the next five years in support of Mission 300. This represents roughly 20 percent of our current funding for the region.

This level of commitment is matched by governments themselves, who are driving reforms, setting bold targets, and creating the conditions needed to transform their energy sectors through National Energy Compacts. These compacts set ambitious, time-bound goals to expand energy infrastructure at competitive costs, harness the benefits of regional power integration, encourage greater private sector participation to unlock additional resources, and strengthen utilities.

In rural or remote settings, distributed renewable energy is filling critical infrastructure gaps by powering both households and small businesses. For example, in Sierra Leone, demand-driven mini-grids are proving that rural electrification can be commercially viable when linked directly to productive uses like milling, cold storage, and digital services.

On the grid side, we’re bringing electricity to schools, health centers, and other public services to help build a stronger, healthier, and more skilled future workforce. In Ethiopia, energy initiatives are creating jobs across sectors, providing sustainable incomes. One project has already connected more than 8 million people and over 19,000 schools, clinics, and government facilities across Ethiopia.

To date, Tanzania’s Rural Electrification Expansion Program has connected more than 16,000 rural businesses to the electricity grid, from food processing and fish farms to construction and mining, boosting their productivity and enabling growth. In Senegal, the Energy Access and Scale-Up Project aims to bring electricity to 600 health clinics, 200 schools, 700 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 200,000 households. This expansion is creating jobs through installation, maintenance, and electrification supply chains while improving productivity in education, health care, and small businesses.

These engagements reflect broader efforts across the region to transform the energy landscape, with a focus on practical solutions that do more than just turn on the lights—they also create jobs at scale.",https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/mission-300-africa-electricity-1140x500?qlt=90&hei=630&wid=1200&fit=hfit,N,,2025-10-09 17:02:25.182271

While all this is going on, the global offshore wind industry is already leveling up to the next phase of growth.
Another offshore wind industry trend to keep an eye on is multi-use, in which offshore wind farms host floating solar arrays and wave energy converters.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

We told you so. For months, CleanTechnica has been chronicling the Republican war on offshore wind farms in the US. All of the threatened projects come under the umbrella of blue states with Democratic governors, which is not a shocker. Except, there is one exception, the massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project. As CleanTechnica pointed out back April and several times since then (most recently on September 23), Virginia’s Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, is a big fan of CVOW and the project appears safe — for now, that is.

Virginia Is For (Offshore Wind) Lovers

Now that the general media is finally paying attention to the Glenn Youngkin connection, let’s take another look at CVOW. The offshore wind project has made regular appearances on the pages of CleanTechnica since the wind-friendly days of the Obama administration, which saw the Interior Department’s newly formed Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issue a series of leases for offshore wind development along the Atlantic coast including CVOW’s parcel of 112,799 acres off the coast of Virginia. BOEM issued the lease to the project developer, the leading US utility Dominion Energy, in 2013.

As with many other offshore wind projects, CVOW somehow managed to keep moving through the development pipeline on up to the last weeks of the first Trump administration. Dominion submitted construction plans to BOEM in December of 2020, which were ultimately approved in January 2024 during President Biden’s term in office.

CVOW & The Jones Act Connection

Despite the long years between 2013 and now, the timeline worked out in Dominion’s favor. Offshore turbine technology has improved over the past 12 years, and Dominion can now take advantage of the efficiencies provided by specialized offshore wind construction ships, too.

Special operations vessels (SOVs) were not available in the US during the early years of offshore wind development, due to a lack of ships compliant with a complex 1920s-era piece of US maritime law called the Jones Act, which is another thing that has been surfacing on the CleanTechnica radar.

Among other provisions, the Jones Act restricts foreign-built and owned ships from transporting goods and services from one US port of call to another. The main idea is to keep a lid on foreign interference with domestic shipping, especially in case of war breaking out.

Stakeholders in the offshore wind industry did manage to figure out some workarounds to set the wheels in motion, but a more effective solution would be for US shipyards to begin building the specialized SOVs (service operations vessels) needed to optimize the offshore workflow.

That finally began to happen in May of 2024, when the Louisiana ship builder Edison Chouest Offshore proudly introduced its new ECO Edison SOV (Service Operations Vessel), billed as the “first-ever American-built, owned, and crewed offshore wind service operations vessel.”

While Edison Chouest was celebrating, Dominion was also building a US-built, flagged, and crewed offshore wind ship, the Charybdis, at the Seatrium AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas. A key milestone occurred in April of 2024 when the ship reached the launch-into-water phase. In February of this year Dominion reported that Charybdis was 96% complete and undergoing sea trials in Texas. By late August the ship was on its way to Virginia, and by mid-September it was reportedly docked and ready for action at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia, just in time to help speed completion of the CVOW project toward 2026, which is just around the corner.

Rocky Seas Ahead For US Offshore Wind Industry

As pointed out by Canary Media earlier today, Governor Youngkin is not the only Virginia Republican to champion the CVOW project. US Representative Jen Kiggans is also a fan, partly on account of the $500 million grid upgrade to be received by Naval Air Station Oceana.

So, much of the work already done and completion just months away, it looks like smooth sailing for the CVOW project — or not, as the case may be. Governor Youngkin is term-limited. Unless something extraordinary happens, the Democratic contender for the office, Abigail Spanberger is on track to prevail against the Republican candidate and current Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears on Election Day in November.

A Spanberger victory would put Virginia and CVOW squarely in the crosshairs of President Trump’s chopping block. Since the beginning of this year, the President has suspended new offshore lease activity, recalled permitted projects for additional review, and ordered construction to stop on projects already under way.

Without Youngkin’s support, CVOW will lose its special status. If Spanberger does win, though, perhaps she can take a page out of the book of New York Governor Kathy Hochul. When Trump stopped work on the Empire Wind project in New York state earlier this year, Governor Hochul reportedly negotiated a quid pro quo with Trump in person, and Empire was quickly back on track.

Spanberger better get her ducks in the water because it already looks like the Trump administration is already prepping for a Democrat to occupy the office of Virginia Governor after Election Day. At a conference in Italy last month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reportedly confirmed that his agency is reviewing five offshore wind projects already under construction, including the CVOW project.

In an interesting turn of events, Empire Wind is also on the list along with another New York project, Sunrise Wind. Governor Hochul may have to pull another card from her sleeve to keep both of those projects in motion.

Make America Lose Again

For the record, rounding Burgum’s hit list is Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Vineyard Wind 1 in Massachusetts.

While all this is going on, the global offshore wind industry is already leveling up to the next phase of growth. Instead of relying on conventional monopile construction methods that apply to relatively shallow waters, the industry is gearing up for the widespread use of floating turbine platforms that can be tethered in deep water, opening up whole new areas for wind development.

Another offshore wind industry trend to keep an eye on is multi-use, in which offshore wind farms host floating solar arrays and wave energy converters. The aquaculture industry is also eyeballing opportunities to piggyback on offshore wind infrastructure, as well.

Too bad the US is missing out on all these new opportunities. What with the economy circling the drain and AI taking over the work that humans used to do, it sure would be nice to have more jobs for people available in construction, ship-building, manufacturing and the like.

The U.S. high-voltage transmission network is vast but aging. 70% of the U.S. transmission lines and transformers have been in service for more than 25 years, a legacy of the mid-20th-century grid buildout. Much of this infrastructure is now strained by new, bidirectional power flows and dynamic loads, unlike the one-way flows it was built for. Much of this infrastructure was originally designed for predictable, one-way power flows from centralized power plants to end users. Today, however, it faces an entirely new set of challenges. The grid must now accommodate dynamic, bidirectional flows from an increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar, community energy projects, electric vehicles, and battery storage systems.

These changes are creating significant stress on a system designed for a different era. Transmission congestion, bottlenecks, and reliability concerns are becoming more common, with some regions experiencing severe delays in interconnecting new generation projects. According to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analysis, meeting near-term electricity demand and clean energy goals will require an estimated 60% increase in transmission capacity by 2030. Without major upgrades, the lack of adequate transmission infrastructure threatens to slow the clean energy transition and increase costs for consumers.

Similarly, ASCE’s 2025 Infrastructure Report Card gave the nation’s energy sector a D+, citing underinvestment and a growing mismatch between grid capability and needs. A surge in large-scale load growth, driven not only by industrial expansions but also by the rapid development of data centers, semiconductor fabrication plants, and hydrogen production facilities, has put tremendous pressure on transmission infrastructure. In short, the existing high-voltage (HV) network often lacks the capacity and modern controls needed to handle today’s explosive load growth without major upgrades.

Data centers: Gigawatt-scale loads

Data centers have become a new super-sized load on the grid. A single large data center can consume as much power as ~80,000 homes, and demand for such facilities is rising at a rate of roughly 10% per year.

In regions like Northern Virginia, the impact is dramatic. For example, the Virginia Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recently reported that PJM’s forecast for the Dominion zone (Virginia) projects about 5.5% annual load growth through 2030, driven almost entirely by new data center load. Additionally, Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” (located in Ashburn, VA) already hosts over 200 facilities and consumes roughly the same amount of electricity as the city of Boston.

AEP likewise projects that more than 13 GW of new data center load will come online by 2029, making these “AI-driven” centers the most significant component of its retail load growth. In short, individual data centers (or clusters) can impose loads comparable to those of mid-sized cities. This unprecedented growth, especially when situated in one region, far exceeds what the system was built to absorb without upgrades.

Interconnection queues and grid bottlenecks

Planners now face huge uncertainty on both ends of the system. On the generation side, nearly 2,600 GW of power and storage projects are stuck in U.S. interconnection queues, more than double the entire existing U.S. generation fleet. Most of these queued projects (solar, wind, batteries) face long study timelines and frequent withdrawals, underscoring a persistent bottleneck. Meanwhile, on the demand side, speculative “phantom” loads are flooding the queues. Data-center loads add another layer of uncertainty. In PJM, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has now recognized the “co-location” of data centers with generation (often gas plants co-owned by data center developers) as a novel issue requiring review. In 2025, FERC launched a proceeding noting that co-location entails “huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs”. In practice, every speculative interconnection, whether a phantom data center or a stalled solar farm, ties up study resources and permits, slowing upgrades to both supply and network infrastructure.

This uncertainty has tangible consequences for reliability. In July 2024, a near-catastrophic incident in Virginia’s Data Center Alley illustrated the risk. A single surge protector failure on a 230 kV transmission line triggered dozens of data centers to disconnect and switch to backup generators. The sudden loss of load caused a significant voltage spike, forcing PJM and Dominion Energy to throttle their generation to avoid cascading outages. This event demonstrates that large loads can cause the system to trip. The traditional grid was built to handle predictable plant outages, not the abrupt, distributed shutdowns of gigawatt-scale data facilities. All this strain comes as new transmission capacity has lagged far behind the need. All this strain comes as new transmission capacity has lagged far behind need, and interconnection studies remain backlogged. Without reforms to streamline queues, coordinate load and supply planning, and invest in flexible grid infrastructure, the risks to grid stability and consumer affordability will only grow.

High-voltage GRID buildout trails need

Despite these stresses, new high-voltage transmission has barely kept up. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Needs Study, approximately 5,000 miles of new high-capacity transmission must be added annually to support a high-renewables future. However, FERC data for 2024 shows that while over 5,000 circuit-miles of transmission were added, only around 22% of that total was at 230 kV or above, highlighting a continued focus on lower-voltage, local reliability upgrades rather than long-haul, high-voltage lines needed to connect remote renewable resources.

Even in Texas, one of the few regions aggressively expanding transmission, progress has been modest relative to demand. ERCOT recently approved its first 765 kV lines to accommodate extreme load growth in the Permian Basin and along the Gulf Coast. AEP Texas is currently constructing a 300-mile, 765 kV Solstice-to-Howard transmission line to move power from West Texas to San Antonio. Still, such examples remain the exception. Overall, the lack of high-voltage corridor expansion has left the grid vulnerable to overload from concentrated new loads (data centers, EV-charging parks, industrial complexes). Decades of deferred HV investment have created an under-built backbone just as demand is skyrocketing.

Planning reforms and solutions

DOE’s new Transmission Interconnection Roadmap explicitly calls for improving transparency and data in the queue process. For instance, “Solution 1.1” is to “improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and standardization of data on projects already in interconnection queues”, including project specifications, costs, and development status. Without such visibility, planners cannot distinguish firm projects from speculative ones. NERC has similarly emphasized that transmission planning must adapt to new loads. Its 2024 reliability assessment stresses the need to “expand the transmission network to deliver supplies from new resources and locations to serve changing loads”, specifically citing the influence of data centers (and EV/hydrogen) on future demand profiles.

Several policy ideas are on the table:

Robust regional planning – FERC’s Order 1000 requires multi-value, multi-region transmission planning. States and RTOs must coordinate long-term scenarios of both load growth, including big data centers and EV fleets, and clean generation. Enforcing these rules can identify the interregional corridors needed.

Cost-sharing across regions – New HV lines often cross states. Proposals include expanded cost-allocation mechanisms that allow benefits, such as reliability and access to renewables, to be shared among multiple beneficiaries.

Grid-enhancing technologies – Utilities are deploying GETs to boost capacity on existing lines. Examples include dynamic line ratings (adjusting limits in real time to weather conditions), STATCOMs/phase-shifting transformers (improving voltage control), and advanced conductor materials. These can increase throughput without the need to build new towers. Dominion Energy in Virginia has upgraded or reconductored over 800 miles of lines with advanced materials, boosting capacity by up to 50%. They are also piloting dynamic line ratings across Northern Virginia to accommodate fluctuating data center loads.

Stronger interconnection requirements – States are also beginning to push back on speculative DC builds. In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission (PUCO) recently approved a new tariff under which large data center operators must pay for at least 85% of their contracted energy usage, regardless of actual consumption. Virginia has moved toward stricter interconnection studies and infrastructure upgrade requirements to prevent overload on local grids. Similarly, Texas has begun requiring larger deposits and staged commitments before interconnection approval, ensuring developers demonstrate financial seriousness. The goal is to make developers commit before clogging the queue.

Federal funding alignment – Infrastructure funds (IIJA, IRA) provide billions for transmission, but these should be targeted at the high-voltage backbone, not just local upgrades.

Bridging the gap

The U.S. faces an acute mismatch: soaring load growth from data centers, electrified transportation, and industrial decarbonization against an aging, underbuilt HV transmission network. The consequences are increasingly visible: higher market prices, strained reliability margins, and near-miss outage events. Solving this challenge will require a paradigm shift. Instead of reacting to load additions after they emerge, planners should forecast the emergence of gigawatt-scale data centers and electrified industrial clusters years in advance. High-voltage corridors at 345 kV, 500 kV, and 765 kV should be proactively planned and built well ahead of demand. The DOE’s annual 5,000-mile transmission target must become a baseline.

Simultaneously, utilities should maximize existing infrastructure by accelerating the deployment of GETs and reconductoring projects. Finally, transparency and data-sharing should become non-negotiable: developers and utilities should jointly provide project specifications, timelines, and load profiles so that system planners can properly prepare. Equally important, some of this information should be made publicly accessible, enabling communities, consumers, and local governments to understand emerging needs and champion solutions before crises occur. In most industries, sharing forward-looking developments with the public is standard practice. The power sector, financed largely by ratepayers, should also embrace this transparency if it hopes to foster lasting trust and build support for critical investments.

The U.S. grid is at a critical inflection point. Whether it evolves to meet the demands of the digital and decarbonized era will depend on bold action, sustained investment, and unprecedented collaboration across regulators, utilities, developers, and consumers.

This has led to widespread confusion without offering solutions to the energy affordability issues facing Maine families every day.

One favorite target for these false claims is offshore wind. The Gulf of Maine has some of the strongest and most consistent winds in the world, making it the most abundant and promising clean energy resource available to us.

In this blog, we won’t restate all the false claims being made by opponents of clean energy, but we will set the record straight on what you should know about offshore wind in Maine.

Offshore Wind Reduces Energy Prices Across New England

Offshore wind is expected to put downward pressure on wholesale market prices in New England, which will be passed through to Maine electricity customers. One way it does this is by replacing expensive oil-fueled power plants that are fired up during periods of high demand. A study released in September 2025 showed that offshore wind power would generate massive savings during high-demand periods, lowering New England electricity prices by 11% and delivering $400 million in wholesale market savings in just three winter months.

In fact, stalling progress on offshore wind will actually lead to higher electricity prices. For example, the State of Connecticut estimated that the Trump Administration’s plan to cancel Revolution Wind, which is already 80% completed, could cost electricity customers across New England, including Maine, $500 million per year in higher supply costs.

Offshore Wind Will Bring Enormous Economic Benefits to Maine

Responsibly developed offshore wind would be a big boost to Maine’s economy and local communities and aligns with Maine’s more than 400-year maritime and shipbuilding heritage.

An independent study released in 2025 showed that an offshore wind port in Maine would support more than 6,000 jobs during construction, an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050, and deliver total economic benefits of $6.6 billion.

That’s why support for a new offshore wind industry spans from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce to Maine’s labor unions.

Offshore Wind Projects Can Be Sited to Avoid Conflict with Maine’s Fishing Industry

Everyone involved in advocating for offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine has made clear that understanding potential impacts to Maine’s fishing industry is essential, so any emerging impacts can be first avoided, then minimized or mitigated.

The best way to avoid impacts is by making sure turbines aren’t located in prime fishing grounds. That’s why NRCM and our partners worked to pass Maine’s 2023 offshore wind bill, which required that projects not be placed in federal Lobster Management Area 1 (LMA1), where nearly all of the Maine-based lobster fleet fish.

The provisions in the bill, plus bipartisan support from Maine’s Congressional delegation and the Mills Administration led to the federal government excluding LMA1 from commercial offshore wind leasing, a big step toward allowing both clean energy and a vibrant fishing industry to exist in the Gulf of Maine at the same time.

Offshore Wind Will Not Be Visible from the Mainland

Commercial offshore wind lease areas in the Gulf of Maine are more than 50 miles from the mainland at their nearest point, will not be visible from shore, and will have no impact on property values.

Offshore Wind Turbines Don’t Harm Whales

There is no scientific evidence linking offshore wind and whale deaths. In fact, the greatest risks whales face are vessel strikes, shifting food species due to climate change, and entanglement with fishing gear.

There is, however, clear evidence linking anti-offshore wind groups that frequently claim a connection between whale deaths and offshore wind to fossil fuel-funded think tanks.

The 2024 Federal Lease Sale was a Vote of Confidence in the Long-term Promise of Offshore Wind in the Gulf of Maine

In October 2024, four commercial floating offshore wind leases were sold in the Gulf of Maine. This exceeded expectations and served as a vote of confidence from developers in the long-term viability and promise of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine, despite political uncertainty, as the lease sale took place days before the 2024 Presidential elections. The four leases make clear that industry is interested in investing in offshore wind if given the chance.

Fossil Fuel Power Generation Has Far Higher Emissions than Offshore Wind, Even Including Materials and Construction

Studies have shown that clean energy like solar and wind have substantially lower lifetime greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels. Including materials, construction, fuel, and decommissioning, wind power (including offshore wind) emits 37 times less greenhouse gases per unit of power generated than natural gas, and 77 times less than coal.

All sources of energy have an impact. The question should be what sources have the lowest. The damaging impacts of our existing fossil fuel system on our health and climate are colossal compared to other clean energy sources that have much lower impacts.

Offshore Wind Can Be Responsibly Developed to Protect Wildlife

Climate change is the greatest threat facing the more than 3,000 marine species and birds in the Gulf of Maine. Replacing polluting fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources like wind is our best opportunity to protect wildlife.

Using the best data and scientific research available, offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine will be held to the highest standards for siting and operations to protect ocean wildlife and ecosystems. Developers will be required to include strong protections for wildlife and the ocean environment for both construction and operations.

It’s crucial that Mainers seek out information from trusted sources. Disinformation is easily spread via social media and should be treated skeptically. NRCM and our partner organizations will continue to educate our supporters and the public using the best information available from scientists and other experts.

We can’t keep relying on expensive fossil fuels to power our homes and businesses. Not only does it drive up electricity prices, it fuels climate change, which is making the storms and flooding harming our communities worse. Responsibly developing offshore wind will generate the large amounts of reliable domestic energy we need to power the future and help keep energy costs affordable.

Base Power, an Austin-based energy technology company, has secured $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the deployment of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by Addition, with participation from leading investors including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, and several new backers such as Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The company, co-founded and led by Zach Dell, is on a mission to modernise America’s ageing power grid through a decentralised network of smart batteries. These home-installed systems allow users to store energy, access backup power, and sell excess electricity back to the grid.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Dell. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

This massive funding round positions Base Power as one of the most well-capitalised startups in the renewable energy and battery infrastructure space, signalling strong investor confidence in distributed energy solutions.

Base Power Funding Expands Domestic Energy Manufacturing

A major portion of the $1 billion raised will go toward domestic manufacturing and large-scale deployment of Base Power’s energy storage technology. The company is constructing its first energy storage and power electronics factory in downtown Austin, Texas, at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press.

This facility will serve as the foundation for Base Power’s broader industrial expansion, with plans already in motion for a second U.S. manufacturing site.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” said Lopas, an executive at Base Power. “The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves.”

Base Power’s model aligns with the broader reindustrialisation movement sweeping across the U.S., as companies bring high-tech manufacturing closer to home to strengthen supply chains and energy independence. The Austin plant represents a major step toward building a self-sustaining ecosystem for renewable energy hardware.

Base Power Funding Supports Grid Stability Through Distributed Storage

At the heart of Base Power’s model is its home battery leasing system, which offers affordable upfront and monthly costs to homeowners. Each installed battery provides backup power during outages and enables users to participate in local energy markets by selling excess electricity back to the grid.

By aggregating thousands of these batteries nationwide, Base Power creates a distributed energy network that can stabilise local grids, reduce peak demand, and prevent blackouts during extreme weather events.

The company recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) programme, which allows distributed batteries to sell electricity directly into the grid. This not only enhances grid reliability but also gives homeowners new revenue streams, creating an economic incentive to adopt clean energy technologies.

“The ADER qualification represents a breakthrough moment,” Dell added. “It’s proof that distributed energy can serve both households and the grid efficiently, sustainably, and profitably.”

How Base Power’s Funding Redefines Energy Distribution

Base Power’s $1 billion Series C comes amid a global push to decentralise energy production and build resilient grid systems capable of handling renewable integration. The company’s battery infrastructure effectively turns homes into micro power plants, creating a two-way energy flow between consumers and utilities.

This distributed model addresses a persistent challenge in the American energy system — the strain on ageing infrastructure. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, outages caused by grid instability have risen over the past decade due to increasing demand and severe weather events. Base Power’s technology offers a scalable path to reduce grid congestion and carbon emissions while empowering homeowners to control their own energy future.

By combining cutting-edge hardware with AI-driven energy management software, Base Power aims to optimise how electricity is stored, distributed, and consumed. This integrated approach represents a shift from centralised power generation to networked energy ecosystems, where communities collectively contribute to energy security.

Base Power’s Vision for a Reindustrialised and Renewable America

Beyond product innovation, Base Power’s strategy emphasises domestic manufacturing and workforce development. The company’s leadership views the construction of its Austin factory as part of a broader national effort to “reindustrialise America.” By revitalising high-tech production capacity within the country, it achieves its purpose.

Lopas explained that the company is not just producing batteries. It is building the infrastructure, systems, tools, and software needed to reinvent the U.S. energy grid from the ground up.

This holistic approach mirrors a growing consensus among policymakers and investors. One where renewable energy transformation requires physical deployment at scale, not just software innovation.

As Base Power expands production, it plans to collaborate with local governments, energy regulators, and technology partners. It seeks to ensure its distributed energy systems integrate seamlessly with regional utilities.

If successful, Base Power could become a cornerstone of America’s clean energy transition. This feat will demonstrate how venture-backed manufacturing and distributed storage can deliver tangible progress.

A New Era for Energy and Infrastructure

Base Power’s $1 billion funding round is not only a milestone for the company but also a sign of renewed confidence in hard-tech innovation and energy infrastructure startups. With leading venture firms betting on its mission, Base Power is positioned to shape the future of how electricity is produced, stored, and shared across the country.

The company’s upcoming Austin factory, growing team, and expanding grid partnerships all underscore its commitment to building a more resilient, decentralised, and sustainable power system for generations to come.",https://ventureburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Create-a-futuristic-neon-lit-poster-for-an-artic…-20.png,N,,2025-10-09 18:04:06.764602
