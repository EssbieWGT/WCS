More than 600 companies, including Northwestern Energy, NASA, and UK Power Networks, rely on Meteomatics for weather data that can significantly impact everything from energy savings and logistics to process automation, risk management, and product design.

The company’s US1k weather model covers the contiguous U.S. and Gulf of Mexico at a resolution of 1 km and updates every hour, integrating data from 110+ sources, including aircraft, ground stations, drones, radars and satellites. Included in these sources is the company’s proprietary Meteodrones—weather drones capable of flying up to 6 km, or 19,500 feet, above mean sea level.

Meteomatics recently released its 2025 Weather Data Trends in Energy Report. Conducted in tandem with market research firm Dynata, the report surveyed 272 senior level energy executives across grid operations, utilities and energy trading, in the U.S. The report explores renewable energy’s impact on them, how they are using the source in their day to day operations, and how the weather affects energy generation. The report also shines a light on other key areas where increasingly extreme weather events are affecting energy executives including those in oil, gas and nuclear, as well as what they are investing in as solutions.

We interviewed Martin Fengler, CEO of Meteomatics, in August 2025.

Q1. What is the main way Meteomatics is impacting the energy industry?

Even a 1% difference in weather forecast accuracy can result in millions of dollars in annual economic losses. With this, power companies need to be able to accurately estimate the weather in order to determine how much energy is being generated, how much is needed to meet demand, and how much can be transmitted at anytime, anywhere. Meteomatics’ weather data models deliver the highest accuracy weather intelligence to companies, from utilities to traders, making this possible. We pair hyperlocal weather data with live data from energy companies’ respective power plants to deliver intra-day and day-ahead energy forecasts for solar, wind, hydropower, and offshore oil and gas platforms.

Q2. Meteomatics' report shows that energy operators are worried about meeting the uptick in energy demand in the U.S. What is causing the uptick?

Both communities and businesses alike are playing a part in the current spike in U.S. energy demand. On the business end, the market’s growing fixation with AI is a leading cause. Major technology companies, including Meta and Google, are investing billions in AI data centers. And now the phenomenon is spreading beyond the technology industry. Blackstone, for example, announced at the Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh a $25B investment in Pennsylvania data centers, which the company stated in a press release is “uniquely suited to serve as a strategic hub to power the nation’s AI objectives”. Large AI projects require a substantial amount of power. As more companies jump on the AI bandwagon, the power grid is under skyrocketing pressure to provide the power needed for AI to run.

Additionally, consumers are increasingly using more electricity amid extreme temperatures. This summer, we have already seen heat waves increase in intensity and longevity, resulting in increased customer demand.

Q3. Heatwaves have a serious effect on the energy business. Why is this, and can the oil and gas industry support the heightened energy demand?

From a power standpoint, the higher the temperature, the higher the cooling demand for air conditioning. The oil and gas industry helps support this heightened energy demand with gas-generated power plants, which are thermal power stations that burn natural gas to generate electricity. However, with temperatures reaching such high levels this summer, utilities need every energy resource they can get to effectively manage building demand.

It’s also important to note that heat affects the power grid infrastructure itself. Certain temperatures can affect the amount of power that power lines can transmit. Utilities aim to prevent overheating their lines and avoid causing outages.

Q4. I’ve heard that temperatures exceeding 100 degrees detrimentally impacts oil refineries. Why is this and how can Meteomatics help?

Refineries are typically designed to operate between 32°F and 95°F. When temperatures exceed these limits, refineries can become inefficient, shut down, or create potentially dangerous working conditions.

Our weather data can help the industry plan for instances like this, ensuring the lights don’t go out and nobody is in harm's way. For example, utilities can use forecasts to determine their energy distribution/trading strategy. If the temperature exceeds 95°F, they can plan to supplement the grid with additional renewable sources in case refineries shut down.

Q5. The report says over half of U.S. energy executives are still looking to increase their reliance on renewable power sources, despite the challenge of daily fluctuations. How can Meteomatics assist here?

Meteomatics’ 1k model provides highly accurate forecasts of even the smallest meteorological events. We can identify local weather patterns within an area of 1 square kilometer, rivaling current leading weather solutions in the U.S., to provide utilities with hyper-accurate insight into the daily conditions affecting their operations.

With this, companies can confidently understand how much renewable energy they’ll produce that day, the next day, or in the weeks following from solar, wind, and hydropower. Companies can also better assess the energy potential of specific locations based on wind speeds or the site's solar radiation. This enhances the reliability of renewable energy sources in power grids, enabling them to be utilized cost-effectively.

Q6. How do battery energy storage systems (BESS) resolve the intermittent sources of wind and solar?

One main challenge our report discovered for utilities is that when there is an excess of energy produced, it cannot be efficiently stored or distributed. That’s where battery energy storage systems can play a crucial role. Fluctuating generation, whether in excess or deficit, will be less of a challenge with BESS. The excess can be saved for later and then utilized when there is not enough energy being generated to support demand. Fifty-two percent (52%) of utilities plan to increase their investment in BESS solutions over the next decade.

Q7. What can you tell us about weather intelligence solutions for resilience of electric power?

Weather conditions can stress and damage power plant infrastructure. For example, wildfires and hurricanes specifically impact transmission lines. With hyperlocal weather data and high-resolution weather modeling, energy companies can harden the grid. This can take the form of everything from dispatching utility crews for severe storms to vegetation management to mitigate wildfires.

Meteomatics is currently working with NorthWestern Energy to strengthen its wildfire risk monitoring and response capabilities. The utility is using our platform to access real-time wildfire indicators—such as wind speed, humidity, and dryness—on a subhourly basis. This enables earlier action to help reduce the risk of service interruptions and infrastructure damage.

Q8. What role does weather intelligence play in energy trading?

Accurate weather intelligence forecasts give energy traders the inside knowledge necessary to capitalize on market opportunities. By anticipating weather-related fluctuations in energy demand and supply, traders can optimize their trading strategies and maximize profits.

For example, with Meteomatics traders can utilize weather data for forecasting natural gas and power demand. Granular weather data is used by power traders for real-time and day-ahead trading decisions across all major regional transmission organizations and independent system operators (e.g. ERCOT, PJM). The speed of ingesting various weather models via the platform during the market day is key for traders to act quickly and efficiently in response to rapidly changing prices.

Q9. Are there other ways Meteomatics and weather intelligence solutions can help keep U.S. power grids stable?

Weather intelligence solutions like ours can help ensure that power grids transmit energy as efficiently as possible, utilizing all available line capacity.

Renewable energy distribution requires a significant amount of grid capacity, but many operators need to build more infrastructure, which takes time. Meanwhile, Meteomatics’ weather data enables utilities to unlock more grid capacity than they previously thought their aging grids could support.

By monitoring weather factors that affect line capacity, such as air temperature, wind speed, and wind direction, in real-time, instead of using historical data, utilities can have a much better gauge of capacity.

For example, higher wind gusts can cool power lines, allowing more energy to be transmitted safely. If a provider knows the wind duration will last, they can safely funnel more power out to meet energy demand.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6897d8d59a7b68966af45c82/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-10 19:59:22.977738

This method, known as agrivoltaics or ‘solar grazing,’ allows farmers to maintain their grazing landscapes while generating electricity. The concept, already popular in Europe and Japan, is now making waves in Australia, offering a promising dual-use of land. The Glenrowan West solar farm, led by Gayle and Tom Lee, exemplifies this trend by integrating a 149-megawatt solar power station with traditional farming practices, paving the way for sustainable agriculture and energy production.

The Agrivoltaic Process: Marrying Grazing with Solar Power

Agrivoltaics, or ‘solar electric sheep,’ is a process that integrates sheep grazing with solar electricity generation. This innovative approach ensures that vegetation under and around solar panels is well-maintained, improving soil health while enabling cost-effective energy production. Australian farmer Ben Wynn has been instrumental in pioneering this model with his company Wynergy, which explores cattle grazing alongside solar farms. However, Wynn emphasizes the challenges of establishing a design that accommodates both animals and solar infrastructure. Misaligned panels or inadequate tracking systems can render solar grazing unfeasible, highlighting the importance of strategic planning.

Advantages for Farmers and Solar Companies

Agrivoltaics offers significant benefits for farmers who wish to retain their grazing landscapes without ceding control to large solar companies. Eric Nordberg, a researcher at the University of New England, points out that this setup benefits both farmers and solar companies. Farmers retain their land, while companies obtain free vegetation management, reducing maintenance costs. Despite the growing interest, local on-the-ground data about the benefits and drawbacks of agrivoltaics remains limited. However, initiatives like the one funded by NSW’s EnergyCo aim to bridge this gap by developing comprehensive guidelines for solar farm setups.

Boosting Wool Quality and Quantity Through Solar Grazing

Solar grazing has been linked to improved wool quality and quantity, an added advantage for farmers. In 2023, Iberdrola, a renewable energy company in Portugal, began utilizing sheep to maintain its photovoltaic farms, finding that the animals help manage land and reduce fire risks. A UK project plans to graze 4,000 sheep on a 1,600-hectare solar farm, potentially saving the project $6.71 million in mowing costs over 40 years. Reports from New South Wales also suggest that sheep grazing under solar panels have produced superior wool, highlighting another advantage of this dual-use land model.

Challenges and Future Prospects

While the agrivoltaic model presents numerous benefits, it is not without challenges. For instance, aligning solar panel infrastructure with grazing needs requires careful design and implementation. Additionally, local data on the practicalities and impacts of such setups is still sparse, necessitating further research and development. Despite these hurdles, the potential of agrivoltaics to revolutionize sustainable farming and energy production is immense. As more countries recognize the dual benefits of this model, the future of agriculture and renewable energy may increasingly intertwine, offering new opportunities for innovation and sustainability.

The integration of farming and solar energy presents a promising avenue for sustainable development, but it raises essential questions about land use and resource management. How can we best balance agricultural needs with renewable energy demands for a sustainable future?

Gov. Tony Evers wrote to the federal Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday, urging the Trump administration not to cancel Wisconsin’s $62.4 million grant to install solar energy systems for low- and moderate-income households.

Evers’ letter to EPA administrator Lee Zeldin followed a New York Times report earlier this week that the agency was preparing to cancel the $7 billion federal “Solar for All” grant program. “Solar for All” was part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed by congressional Democrats and signed by then-president Joe Biden.

“To be clear, attempting to terminate Solar for All grants has no legitimate purpose or justification,” Evers wrote. “Beyond that, doing so will also negatively impact Wisconsinites and our state, causing increased energy bills for Wisconsinites and hurting efforts to improve air quality, boost resilience, and create good-paying jobs.”

The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. has put out a request for proposal seeking an implementer for the state’s program, called “PowerUp Wisconsin.” Bidders were to submit a notice of their intent to bid by this past Monday, Aug. 4, and final proposals are due on Friday, Aug. 29.

According to the WEDC’s work plan for the project, Wisconsin’s grant would add rooftop solar power systems to 1,038 households in single-family homes and 2,200 more households in 24 multifamily homes. The plan also calls for 10 community solar projects that could serve an additional 4,239 households.

Evers told Zeldin in the letter that since Wisconsin’s $62.4 million grant was awarded in April 2024, the WEDC has worked with local governments, solar installers, utilities and housing developers to draw up the state’s program guidelines. The program would reduce Wisconsin’s reliance on out-of-state energy and save households up to $500 a year on their energy bills, Evers wrote.

The governor wrote that lowering costs has been “a top priority” for his administration.

“While the Trump Administration claims to share this priority, terminating Wisconsin’s Solar for All grant would have the exact opposite effect, preventing Wisconsin families and households from seeing the direct savings offered through PowerUp Wisconsin,” Evers wrote.

The Evers administration and the Wisconsin Department of Justice have joined a number of lawsuits to block Trump administration executive orders and unilateral actions to cut funding approved by Congress.

Evers’ letter appeared to leave open the prospect for more litigation. “At a time when energy demand continues to increase, it is unfathomable for the Trump Administration to unnecessarily — and potentially illegally — terminate funding for a program designed to deploy affordable, renewable energy systems,” Evers wrote.

The old EV batteries will be put to very good use in Texas

One of the major environmental concerns when it comes to EV batteries is what happens to them when they’re no longer usable.

As many as 100,000 EVs, and therefore 100,000 electric car batteries, will be retired this year in the US alone – and traditionally old EV batteries haven’t been the easiest things to recycle.

Thankfully, times are changing, and several companies are working on ways to reuse these old EV batteries.

One such company is B2U Storage Solutions, which recently announced a new energy storage facility in Texas that is made up of hundreds of old batteries from electric vehicles.

The batteries will be housed in 21 cabinets roughly the size of shipping containers, and will charge up when there is an excess of renewable energy production on the grid and power is relatively cheap.

This is the first of its kind in Texas, but the company is planning on building three more similar facilities throughout 2026, which will have a combined capacity of 100 megawatt hours.

To give that some context, the Texas Tribune reports that an average Texan household uses 30 kilowatt hours per day, so the facilities could have enough energy to power more than 3,000 homes for a day.

“We’re really helping to pioneer and demonstrate to the automotive industry that repurposing makes a lot of sense for a pretty healthy number of batteries before they’re truly ready for end of life and recycling,” CEO and co-founder of B2U Storage Solutions, Freeman Hall told the publication.

It’s not the only use for old batteries from electric cars

B2U Storage Solutions isn’t the only company cutting down on EV battery waste.

Redwood Materials, a company founded by a former Tesla exec, specializes in reusing and recycling electric car batteries.

In a blog post, the company explained that it has received around 250,000 old EV batteries so far and has found that many of them have more than half of their usable capacity.

So, rather than leaving the batteries to rot, Redwood Materials has been repurposing them as both stationary energy storage and in lower-power applications.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/battery.webp,N,,2025-08-10 18:00:12.854829

Minister for Climate, Environment and Water, Susan Close, said the vertical axis wind turbine was an ""exciting development"".

A small Australian-first vertical axis wind turbine has helped power a building site for crews working on the duplication of Main South Road between Aldinga and Sellicks beaches.

The developers of the turbine — which is just a fraction of the size of the wind turbines that dominate rural landscapes across Australia — could become part of the country's renewable energy mix, providing power to businesses and potentially homes.

Flinders University has been working on the project for several years with company VAWT-X Energy.

Mechanical and aerospace engineer Dr Amir Zanj said the recent three-month trial had been positive, but that a lot more work and financial investment would be required.

""Without this technology being fully completed, still in the prototype level, we've received several requests from wineries … small manufacturers, small businesses and farmers,"" Dr Zanj said.

The project has been funded with support from both federal and state governments, as well as a private investor.

""Without all these elements around the table, making something of this scale would be impossible,"" Dr Zanj said.

The 6-kilowatt wind turbine was used to power CPB Contractors's construction site, and project manager Andrew Coonan said that there were advantages to having an energy source that can potentially run all day.

""Obviously the sun doesn't shine 24 hours of the day … so we really see this as integrating into the mix of energy sources,"" Mr Coonan said.

""Our compounds typically are powered by fossil fuels and having to tap into the [electricity] network, so having the ability to use wind power, solar power, sometimes there's bio-fuel generators that can be used as well.

""Having a real mix in there, means we can get away from fossil fuels for our projects.""

Aim for commercial version to be ready next year

VAWT-X Energy managing director Gary Andrews said it had taken several years to create the current prototype, but he hoped he would have a product ready for manufacture within 12 months.

""The aim is to learn from it to see what faults there are and find solutions to fix those and have a commercial version by early next year,"" Mr Andrews said.

""Solar only operates during the day, so if you want to go off-grid, ideally, you want to be able to have the potential to be able to generate electricity 24/7.

""So if you have solar and a wind turbine, then you're potentially getting electricity day and night.""

Mr Andrews said he hoped to be able to manufacture locally in South Australia and wants to keep the cost to around $36,000, plus installation.

""We hope that this will be adopted across Australia and elsewhere in the world as a form of distributed renewable energy,"" Mr Andrews said.

The project has been given support from federal and South Australian governments, including a $300,000 grant from the Department of State Development.

Minister for Climate, Environment and Water, Susan Close, said the vertical axis wind turbine was an ""exciting development"".

""This wind turbine is able to capture more energy from low wind, which means is more useful for longer,"" she said.

""You would expect that the state that is the most switched on in Australia for wind and solar would see the most innovation, and that's exactly what's happening.""

Small-scale turbines could fill the niche

David Burton, from Monash University's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said large wind farms that use horizontal axis wind turbines have dominated the global wind energy market.

Mr Burton said they had been found to be more commercially viable than vertical axis options like the VAWT-X prototype.

""As a general rule, horizontal axis turbines are significantly more efficient than vertical axis wind turbines … so primarily that's the challenge,"" he said.

""There's quite a large number of manufacturers who have delved into that [vertical] technology, previously … it's not a new thing.

But Mr Burton said smaller scale turbines could potentially be the best way for the vertical technology to find its niche.

""If I was to look at a place for vertical axis wind then it's in the area that they're targeting, that sort of application seems to be the most logical,"" he said.

""That seems to be where the technology is most likely to succeed, at least at this stage.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3b5a53a889d7b7d25657882d3ce0d8da?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=189&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-08-10 17:59:55.581137

The ‘WA Can’t Wait’ report is available here

Images are available in the Greenpeace Media Library here

PERTH, Monday 11 August 2025 – A new analysis released today by an alliance of unions and leading environmental organisations has recommended a nation-first 'decommissioning hub' be built in Western Australia to manage the state's growing number of retired offshore oil and gas infrastructure.

The WA Can’t Wait report, a collaboration between Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Unions WA, Conservation Council WA, Maritime Union of Australia - WA Branch, The Wilderness Society, Australian Manufacturing Workers Union - WA Branch, Electrical Trades Union - WA Branch, found that a WA decommissioning hub would deliver thousands of secure, skilled jobs, protect marine ecosystems and coastal communities, and direct scrap steel and other valuable resources into local domestic circular supply chains.

The report's recommendations include that:

A decommissioning hub be built in Western Australia, near current fossil fuel infrastructure and where green recycling facilities can be established

Oil and gas operators are held financially responsible and a fully industry-funded clean-up be mandated

Existing laws are strengthened and enforced to ensure a full and timely decommissioning

The safety of workers and the environment is prioritised

Investment in ports, recycling facilities and local workforces is increased to support decommissioning and emerging offshore wind and other renewable energy industries.

Geoff Bice, Greenpeace Australia Pacific WA Campaign Lead, said:

“Our oceans are buckling under pressure from the fossil fuel industry, the drilling, extracting and burning of fossil fuels, and the mismanagement of oil and gas infrastructure. Spills and discarded toxic material have dire impacts on the ocean and all life that depends on it.

""89% of Australia’s 5.7 million tonnes of offshore oil and gas infrastructure is in West Australian waters. The fossil fuel industry treats our oceans like a dump. WA’s oceans can’t become a graveyard for the rotting skeletons of the oil and gas industry.

“A decommissioning hub is WA-positive, and the industry should foot the bill for their own mess. This isn’t just a clean-up plan, it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build a world-leading industry.”

Rikki Hendon, UnionsWA Secretary, said:

“The oil and gas infrastructure off Western Australia’s coastline must be decommissioned at the end of its life. That work needs to be done properly, safely, and locally.

“The opportunity to create thousands of secure jobs here in WA by putting in place a local decommissioning hub is right in front of us. We have the people, we have the industrial capacity, and we have the know-how.”

Matt Roberts, Conservation Council of Western Australia Executive Director, said:

“50% of Australia’s offshore oil and gas infrastructure is due to be decommissioned by 2030 and most of it is in WA. It is critical that companies are held to account to deliver on their environmental responsibilities.

There are also huge opportunities for new jobs in decommissioning and metals recycling. These are the jobs of the future that will help us transition to renewable energy.""

Will Tracey, Maritime Union of Australia WA Secretary, said:

“This report is a wake-up call. It shows that with the right coordination, WA can get the job done locally and safely — creating union jobs, protecting our pristine coast, and practicing responsible stewardship of hazardous waste. We welcome this practical, worker and community-focused contribution to solving a national decommissioning bottleneck. This is how we keep high value jobs in WA and secure economic strength for decades to come, building a bridge between the energy past and a just, sustainable future.

""While this report points the way forward, the federal government is doing the opposite — towing the Northern Endeavour and 40,000 tonnes of recyclable steel to Europe instead of backing local yards and local jobs. It’s time for the government to act on what workers and communities are calling for: full removal, local recycling, and a Future Made in Australia that starts in WA.”

Steve McCartney, Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union WA Secretary, said:

""Western Australia has an opportunity to develop a circular economy in steel production, using the decommissioning of oil and gas infrastructure as a feedstock for green steel recycling onshore.

""Not only would this help stand up green steel projects in the South West, it would provide long-term and stable onshore demand so we never see another debacle like the Northern Endeavour work being stolen from Australian workers ever again.""

Fern Cadman, Wilderness Society Fossil Fuel Industry Campaigner, said:

“Australia and WA are already behind the eight ball on decommissioning. The longer we wait, the harder the work is and the more the environment is at risk. We hope this report is a kick into gear for governments and industry.

""The magnificent oceans of WA mustn't become an industrial wasteland for the oil and gas sector. Cleaning up the legacy of the offshore oil and gas industry is a responsibility and an opportunity.""

Adam Woodage, Electrical Trades Union WA Secretary, said:

""Decommissioning must be approached with the highest standards of safety and environmental responsibility. Cutting corners puts workers, communities and our fragile marine ecosystems at risk. The legacy we leave beneath the waves must reflect not just decades of extraction, but our commitment to doing the right thing when the work is done.""

The report release follows recent revelations that Australian taxpayers are facing a $500 million clean-up bill for Chevron’s aging oil and gas infrastructure in WA waters and that the safety regulator NOPSEMA has ordered Woodside to restart decommissioning work at several offshore oil and gas fields.

Conclusion: A Structural Shift with Long-Term Payoffs The electrification of water heating is a linchpin of the U.S. clean energy transition.","The U.S. water heating sector is undergoing a seismic transformation. Driven by regulatory tailwinds, technological innovation, and shifting consumer preferences, the adoption of electric and heat pump water heaters is accelerating at an unprecedented pace. This shift is not merely a trend but a structural realignment of the energy landscape, creating compelling long-term opportunities for investors in manufacturers, suppliers, and the broader clean energy ecosystem.

Regulatory Tailwinds: Policy as a Catalyst for Growth

Federal and state-level incentives have become the cornerstone of this transition. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has supercharged adoption through tax credits and rebates, with the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit offering up to $2,000 for heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit providing 30% tax credits for solar and geothermal systems. These incentives are complemented by state programs like Michigan's MiHER initiative, which offers rebates of up to $840 per unit.

The impact is measurable: HPWH adoption rates have surged in states with robust programs, such as Maine and California, where streamlined eligibility and direct discounts have reduced barriers to entry. By 2025, these policies are projected to cut the effective cost of electrification by 40–60%, making HPWHs competitive with traditional gas systems.

Technological Innovation: Efficiency and Integration

At the heart of this shift is the rapid advancement of heat pump technology. Modern HPWHs now achieve energy efficiency ratios (EER) of 3.0–4.0, reducing energy consumption by up to 60% compared to conventional electric models. Innovations like AI-driven maintenance alerts, IoT-enabled smart controls, and hybrid systems that integrate with solar panels are further enhancing value propositions.

For example, A.O. Smith's smart water heaters and Rheem's ultra-high-efficiency models exemplify how manufacturers are leveraging digital tools to optimize performance and user experience. These technologies not only lower operational costs but also align with the growing demand for smart home integration, a market segment projected to grow at 12% annually through 2030.

Market Dynamics: Growth Projections and Competitive Landscape

The U.S. electric water heating market is forecasted to expand from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $7.8 billion by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5%. Heat pump water heaters, in particular, are expected to grow at a 7% CAGR, outpacing traditional models. This growth is fueled by stringent energy efficiency standards, rising electricity costs, and the phase-out of less efficient units.

Leading manufacturers like A.O. Smith, Rheem, and Bradford White dominate the market, collectively holding 30% of the global commercial segment. These firms are investing heavily in R&D and strategic partnerships. A.O. Smith's collaboration with renewable energy providers and Rheem's focus on hybrid systems highlight their adaptability to the clean energy transition.

Supply Chain Opportunities: Beyond the Big Names

While leading manufacturers capture headlines, the supply chain offers equally compelling opportunities. Component manufacturers producing advanced insulation materials, smart sensors, and heat pump compressors are poised for growth. For instance, companies supplying high-efficiency compressors for HPWHs could benefit from the sector's expansion.

Recent tariffs on imports from China and Vietnam have also spurred domestic production, creating a tailwind for U.S. suppliers. This shift is evident in the rise of regional manufacturing hubs, particularly in the Southwest and Northeast, where proximity to renewable energy infrastructure and skilled labor pools is a strategic advantage.

Investment Thesis: A Multi-Faceted Opportunity

The electrification of water heating is a multi-decade transition with clear beneficiaries:

1. Manufacturers: A.O. Smith, Rheem, and Bradford White are well-positioned to capitalize on demand for high-efficiency systems. Their R&D pipelines and strategic partnerships align with long-term regulatory and consumer trends.

2. Suppliers: Component makers in the heat pump and smart grid sectors offer diversification and resilience.

3. Utilities and Energy Providers: The integration of HPWHs with renewable energy systems creates synergies for companies like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy.

Risks and Mitigations

Challenges remain, including uneven adoption rates in rural areas and the need for workforce training. However, programs like Efficiency Maine's contractor certification initiatives and the IRA's focus on equity are addressing these gaps. Investors should also monitor policy continuity, as future administrations may adjust incentives.

Conclusion: A Structural Shift with Long-Term Payoffs

The electrification of water heating is a linchpin of the U.S. clean energy transition. With regulatory support, technological innovation, and robust market growth, this sector offers a compelling investment case. For those seeking exposure to the energy transition, a diversified portfolio of manufacturers, suppliers, and utilities is a strategic bet on a future where efficiency and sustainability are non-negotiable.

As the market evolves, early movers will reap the rewards of a structural shift—one that redefines how we heat water, reduce emissions, and build a cleaner energy future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 17:01:25.217636

According to recent posts on X from Tesla North America and echoed by CEO Elon Musk, the credit requires not just placing an order but actually taking delivery of the vehicle by the end date. This nuance has sparked widespread urgency, with Musk emphasizing the “important re timing of vehicle delivery” in a quote of the company’s alert, highlighting that mere ordering won’t suffice amid potential supply chain and regulatory hurdles.

Industry analysts note this deadline stems from the Inflation Reduction Act, set to phase out the full credit after September 30, as detailed on the Internal Revenue Service website. Tesla’s own support page warns that the company cannot guarantee delivery timelines, advising buyers to consult tax professionals, underscoring the personal financial risks involved.

The Rush to Delivery: Navigating Tesla’s Supply Chain Challenges

Recent news reports indicate a buying frenzy, with EV sales spiking as consumers race against the clock. A Gizmodo article published just hours ago describes it as “The Great American EV Tax Credit Rush,” noting Tesla’s outsized benefits from the scramble, with order volumes reportedly overwhelming some service centers. Similarly, Autocar Professional reported 17 hours ago on surging U.S. EV sales driven by the impending cutoff, attributing the boom to fears of losing the subsidy under potential policy shifts.

Tesla’s inventory tools, as promoted in X posts from Tesla North America, direct buyers to vehicles available for immediate delivery, a strategy reminiscent of past end-of-quarter pushes. Historical tweets from Musk, dating back to 2018 and 2019, show a pattern of urgent calls to action around tax credit phase-outs, often tying them to year-end deliveries or display model discounts.

Eligibility Hurdles and Model-Specific Insights

Not all Tesla models qualify uniformly; the credit applies to vehicles like the Model 3, Model Y, and certain variants of the Model X, provided they meet U.S. manufacturing and battery sourcing requirements outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. Kiplinger’s recent guide on EV tax credits, updated July 11, 2025, breaks down income limits—$150,000 for single filers and $300,000 for joint—which could disqualify higher earners, adding another layer of complexity.

Financing plays a pivotal role, with tips from EV Life’s blog post on July 7, 2025, suggesting buyers explore point-of-sale rebates to apply the credit upfront, potentially easing cash flow. However, Tesla’s disclaimer on its incentives page stresses that eligibility hinges on individual tax situations, and changes could arise from federal updates.

Market Implications: Broader EV Industry Fallout

The deadline’s approach has broader repercussions, as CNBC reported two days ago on EV sales soaring amid speculation of policy reversals under a potential Trump administration influence. Tekedia’s analysis from a day ago attributes the surge to legislative backing, warning that post-September, affordability could plummet for middle-class buyers, pressuring Tesla’s pricing strategy.

Insiders point to Tesla’s production ramps in Fremont and Austin as critical, yet supply bottlenecks—exacerbated by global chip shortages and labor issues—could leave some orders unfulfilled. X sentiment reflects frustration, with users sharing stories of delayed deliveries, echoing Musk’s unrelated but timely post on Full Self-Driving advancements, which might indirectly boost appeal for hurried purchases.

Strategic Advice for Buyers and Tesla’s Long Game

For prospective owners, acting swiftly means monitoring Tesla’s app for real-time inventory and considering used models eligible for a $4,000 credit, also expiring soon, per IRS guidelines. Yahoo Finance’s piece from a month ago outlines qualification steps, urging documentation readiness to claim the credit on 2025 tax returns.

Looking ahead, Tesla may pivot to alternative incentives, like software upgrades or leasing deals, to maintain momentum. As Musk’s X activity suggests, the company is betting on innovation—such as robotaxi developments—to offset subsidy losses, positioning Tesla not just as a carmaker but a tech ecosystem leader in a post-credit era. This deadline, while a short-term boon, tests the resilience of EV adoption without federal crutches, potentially reshaping competitive dynamics with rivals like Ford and GM.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-dc582c13-9e0a-40fb-8ae2-635ebfa718a7.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 17:01:05.386191

Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act mandates the end of coal-fired electricity production, or even its import from other states, by the end of this year.
Ferguson should commit to a holistic state strategy across all agencies to prioritize renewable energy projects, particularly those in jeopardy because of Congress’ actions.","Higher energy bills are coming to Washington state, thanks to Congress passing President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” or HR 1, which he signed on July 4. But if Gov. Bob Ferguson and state agencies can streamline the regulatory process for building wind and solar power projects, the state can spare consumers some of those ballooning electricity costs.

The federal bill is killing subsidies for wind and solar power generation, with nearly $9 billion across 27 clean energy facilities around the state at risk according to the think tank Energy Innovation. That’s real money that will make those clean energy projects cost more, and, in some cases, stop them altogether, eliminating critical new megawatts from the grid as well as jeopardizing the workforce able to build them.

The subsidies were created by the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act during the Biden administration. At Trump’s urging, Republicans voted to sunset them. Projects not under construction by July 4, 2026, nor those completed by the end of 2027, won’t be able to claim a 30% tax credit.

Under Washington state’s clean energy transformation laws, utilities will still pay to build those power sources — but they will be more expensive because HR 1 craters those subsidies. Utilities around the state will have no choice but to pass on those costs to ratepayers. In condemning the legislation, Ferguson announced in July the U.S. Climate Alliance expects Washingtonians’ average household energy bills could increase by $115 a year by 2029.

That is, unless more solar and wind projects can meet the sunsetting deadlines. Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, whose agency plays a key role ensuring the state can achieve its clean energy goals, told the editorial board it’s incumbent on state agencies to “move heaven and earth” and ensure Washington state government isn’t the barrier that keeps a project from getting over the finish line.

Washington’s Clean Energy Transformation Act mandates the end of coal-fired electricity production, or even its import from other states, by the end of this year. Less supply on the grid, coupled with rapid new demand for electricity, is already a recipe for upward pressure on utility bills.

Ferguson should commit to a holistic state strategy across all agencies to prioritize renewable energy projects, particularly those in jeopardy because of Congress’ actions. Nguyễn said the governor is considering such a strategy.

For inspiration, Washington could follow Colorado Gov. Jared Polis’ example. Earlier this month, he mobilized his state to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks” for such projects to get as many under construction as possible.

“Getting this right is of critical importance to Colorado ratepayers,” Polis said in an order to state agencies. “By maximizing the utilization of tax credits while they’re available and reducing future tariff uncertainty, the State can avoid billions of dollars in additional energy costs for decades to come.”

Clean energy projects, as well as upgrades to high-voltage transmission lines, proceed in Washington at a snail’s pace under environmental reviews, a cumbersome permitting-and-siting process and local opposition from neighbors.

Nguyễn believes Washington’s abundant sun and wind can amply gird Washington’s electric grid.

“The limitations that we have are not technical. They’re bureaucracy. It’s red tape, it’s regulation … those things we impose on ourselves,” Nguyễn told Austin Jenkins on Inside Olympia in April.

In the long run, the Legislature can help, too, in moving faster on needed grid-enhancing projects. An example can be found within a state bill, proposed this year by Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, to exempt upgrading transmission lines, the highways of electricity across the state, from some environmental reviews. The bill did not survive this year’s legislative session but shows lawmakers can, and should, seek ways to ease regulatory burdens in building critical clean energy infrastructure while still maintaining environmental safeguards.

Meanwhile, the state continues to give tax subsidies to data centers that increasingly feast on the grid’s electrons. The editorial board believes that policy should get another look when the Legislature reconvenes in January.

One silver lining: The federal bill kept in place subsidies for other new electricity generation technologies. Trouble is those methods have yet to mature and aren’t helpful today. Building small modular nuclear reactors, digging deep to tap geothermal energy and other sources are still likely a decade from deployment on the grid.

Trump and Congress, through elimination of the tax credits, are signaling to the investors and producers of wind and solar a more difficult path lies ahead. It’s up to Ferguson and state leaders to counter that signal and remind them Washington state is, and will continue to be, a leader in building out a clean energy economy.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08082025_tzr_tzr_122405.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-10 16:00:15.230413

Panasonic Holdings Corp.’s newest battery plant in the US is on track to reach full production by later this year, a senior executive said, easing concern about the Japanese electronics maker’s commitment to supplying Tesla Inc. and other electric vehicle makers.

“We’re going to be full production this year,” Megan Myungwon Lee, the company’s head of North American operations, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Monday.

Her comments come after Japan’s Nikkei reported last week that Panasonic planned to delay bringing production at the Kansas facility up to full capacity.

“When we commit to something, we’re fully committed and we want to make sure we support all the customers,” she said. “We’re not feeling the slowdown yet and we’re very bullish.”

Tesla, Panasonic’s biggest battery cell customer in the US, reported a 13% drop in US sales for the second quarter compared with a year ago as demand for its EVs weakened.

The new factory will ship battery cells to Tesla as well as several other EV makers, including Lucid Group Inc. and Hexagon Purus ASA.

“We’re definitely working with Tesla but we want to work with other established OEMs as well as startups,” Lee said, adding that Panasonic’s partnership with Tesla is “very strong.”

Lee spoke at a ceremony commemorating the grand opening of Panasonic’s second battery factory in the US, located in De Soto, Kansas, near Kansas City. While the facility is online and battery cells are being made, construction is still ongoing. At completion, the plant will have about 32 gigawatt-hours of annual capacity — enough to supply cells for 500,000 EVs.

The company also operates a battery manufacturing factory in Nevada, which has supplied Tesla since 2017.

Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have pioneered a method that combines these technologies to produce critical parts in days rather than weeks, potentially accelerating the deployment of new nuclear facilities. This development, highlighted in a recent article from Tom’s Hardware, underscores a shift toward faster, more efficient manufacturing processes that could address longstanding delays in nuclear projects.

The Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor serves as a prime example, where AI algorithms optimize designs for 3D printing, ensuring components withstand extreme conditions like high radiation and temperatures. By leveraging additive manufacturing, engineers can create complex geometries that traditional methods struggle with, reducing material waste and costs. According to reports from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, this approach not only speeds up production but also integrates real-time data analytics to refine builds on the fly.

Accelerating Innovation in Nuclear Builds

Beyond speed, the integration of AI brings predictive capabilities to the forefront. Machine learning models analyze vast datasets from simulations and historical builds to foresee potential flaws, allowing for preemptive adjustments. This is particularly vital for small modular reactors (SMRs), which promise modular assembly and scalability. A post on X from the Nuclear Business Platform emphasized how 3D printing could enable precision-engineered parts with minimal waste, especially for SMRs, signaling a massive impact on future energy infrastructure.

Industry pioneers are hailing this as a “new era of nuclear construction,” as noted in coverage by Yahoo Tech. The U.S. Department of Energy’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility at Oak Ridge is actively scaling up these techniques, anticipating a boom in nuclear energy demand. Recent demonstrations show that 3D-printed components meet rigorous standards, with Oak Ridge Lab sharing on X that their researchers have validated these parts for real-world nuclear applications.

Navigating the Safety Tightrope

Yet, amid the enthusiasm, safety concerns loom large. The nuclear sector’s zero-tolerance for errors means that any innovation must undergo exhaustive scrutiny. Critics worry that rapid prototyping via 3D printing might introduce microscopic defects undetectable by conventional inspections, potentially compromising reactor integrity over time. A detailed analysis in TechRadar questions whether this “new era” prioritizes speed over safety, urging close regulatory oversight at every step.

AI’s role adds another layer of complexity. While it enhances design accuracy, reliance on algorithms raises questions about data quality and bias. If training data overlooks rare failure modes, the results could be catastrophic. Insights from Power Technology highlight how Oak Ridge’s Transformational Challenge Reactor Program uses AI for 21st-century nuclear advancements, but stresses the need for robust verification methods to confirm component reliability.

Regulatory and Industry Responses

Regulators are responding cautiously. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is developing frameworks to certify 3D-printed parts, drawing on lessons from aerospace where similar technologies have been vetted. Experts like those at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, as reported in World Nuclear News, are exploring additive manufacturing for fusion components, emphasizing complementary methods to ensure structural integrity.

Industry insiders point to successful pilots as evidence of viability. For instance, a 3D-printed nuclear reactor core, first conceptualized in 2020 and discussed in multiple WIRED posts on X, is set to come online, marking a milestone. Recent X updates from Tom’s Hardware reinforce that 3D printing is pivotal for nuclear progress, with pioneers slashing construction times dramatically.

Balancing Benefits and Risks

The economic incentives are compelling: faster builds could lower the astronomical costs of nuclear plants, making clean energy more accessible. A New Atlas article details how 3D printing revolutionizes plant construction by anticipating energy booms, while integrating sustainable materials as noted in Complete AI Training.

However, safety advocates call for interdisciplinary collaboration. Combining AI-driven simulations with physical testing could mitigate risks, ensuring that innovations don’t outpace safeguards. As Efosa from TechRadar warns, while these tools offer powerful benefits, caution is essential to prevent oversights in this high-risk field.

Looking Ahead to a Transformed Sector

Looking forward, the synergy of 3D printing and AI could democratize nuclear technology, enabling rapid prototyping for custom solutions in remote or disaster-prone areas. Yet, ongoing research must address material durability under prolonged exposure, with labs like Oak Ridge leading efforts to scale safely.

Ultimately, this technological convergence promises to revitalize nuclear energy, but only if balanced with unwavering commitment to safety. As the industry navigates these advancements, the lessons learned will shape not just reactors, but the future of global energy security.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-1550c18b-cb38-476f-b74d-86967a2b8ca8.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 15:06:09.481911

The data center industry is expected to contribute $9.1 billion in gross domestic product to Virginia’s economy annually.
That’s a prospect that’s hard to ignore for counties with Big Tech knocking on their doors.
“Enough is enough,” said Loudoun County Vice Chair Michael Turner, also a Democrat, who is largely opposing new data centers.
“Both our political parties have been completely captured by Big Tech and are doing the bidding of Big Tech in every way imaginable,” he said.","That debate is inching up the ballot as state lawmakers race to regulate a nascent industry, governors rush to embrace a new economic boon and Big Tech makes major investments in AI growth.

Even as data centers are ready to explode on the national scene, the politics around them don’t cut neatly across party lines. The sites sit at the intersection of a typically partisan divide between pro-business interests and organized labor. Efforts to regulate data centers in Virginia’s Legislature have drawn bipartisan backing, though they’ve been largely unsuccessful because of concerns about local control and excessive bureaucracy. And some Democratic officials appear as eager as their Republican counterparts to attract data centers to help bolster their states’ economies.

“Every governor — Democrat or Republican — is going to want economic development. I think the question is always at what cost — and that’s where you see some of the political rubber meeting the road in terms of cost of energy bills, whether Big Tech’s paying its fair share,” Virginia-based Democratic strategist Jared Leopold said.

But, he added, “it is so nascent that there isn’t a standard Democratic-versus-Republican playbook for dealing with data centers yet.”

Tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft are counting on data centers to power their AI expansions — and the U.S. already has more of these facilities than any other country. President Donald Trump has vowed to “win the AI race,” moving to implement a Biden-era executive order to build the facilities on federal lands and announcing a $500 billion AI and data center sprint with large tech companies known as Stargate, with a site underway in Texas.

But the surge is proving polarizing, particularly in northern Virginia — considered the tip of the spear on this issue with the world’s largest and fastest-growing data center market. The Energy Department is projecting data centers will require up to nearly three times as much energy by 2028, raising fears that the tech sector will turn to polluting sources like coal and natural gas in their rush for power.

The data center industry is expected to contribute $9.1 billion in gross domestic product to Virginia’s economy annually.

In Loudoun County, Virginia, that has meant a $250 million budget surplus and a property tax cut. That’s a prospect that’s hard to ignore for counties with Big Tech knocking on their doors.

“We don’t know where to put the money,” said Democrat Juli Briskman, who sits on the county board of supervisors.

But the typical residential ratepayer in that state could experience a $14 to $37 monthly electric bill increase by 2040, according to a report from Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, in part because of the need for infrastructure upgrades whose costs could be spread to all customers.

“Enough is enough,” said Loudoun County Vice Chair Michael Turner, also a Democrat, who is largely opposing new data centers. “The next election for supervisor will hinge on data centers,” adding that two weeks don’t go by where he doesn’t hear from other county officials around the country looking for advice.

In Arizona, Tucson’s city council just unanimously voted against a massive data center proposal from Amazon that promised jobs and millions in tax revenue but stoked fears about its water and energy consumption.

In other cases, public officials of both parties are rushing to capitalize on the promises of AI — and the tax dollars it can bring in.

John Chambers, a spokesperson for Rep. Mike Carey (R-Ohio), said in a statement he attributes the Columbus area’s growth to “tech jobs and data centers that will help America win the AI innovation race” and that he supports “an all-of-the-above energy strategy to ensure electricity is affordable and available for families and businesses in the region.”

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who’s seeking a third term as governor and is considered a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, is looking to lure data centers to his state so as not to miss out on the boom.

And down south, De’Keither Stamps, a Democratic member of Mississippi’s Public Services Commission, said data centers could bring positive economic development and the opportunity to finance needed electrical system upgrades “if regulated prudently.”

Not everyone is on board. Ben Inskeep, program director at Indiana-based Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group, sees the issue is up for grabs and at an inflection point as grassroots opposition takes shape.

“Both our political parties have been completely captured by Big Tech and are doing the bidding of Big Tech in every way imaginable,” he said. “This does have all the hallmarks of an issue that could create new, interesting political coalitions.”

In the Virginia Legislature, efforts to put guardrails around the rapid expansion of data centers — such as assessing who’s footing the energy bills for them — drew bipartisan support even as they failed. Youngkin, the Republican governor, vetoed a bipartisan bill that would have required data-center applications complete site assessments because he said he didn’t want to create “unnecessary red tape.”

Still, “It’s less partisan than most issues. It’s more geographic,” said Virginia state Del. Ian Lovejoy, a Republican from Prince William County who unsuccessfully pushed a bill last session to put land buffers between data centers and parks, schools and residential areas.

“So if you’re in an area that is negatively affected by them, then it crosses party lines. And if you’re not in an area that’s really affected by them, neither party really cares that much, because broadly speaking, on the right side of the aisle you have the pro-business desire to build, and on the left side of the aisle, you have the labor movement, where unions really like these data centers because it’s jobs.”

Now, Lovejoy expects state Democrats to loosen fossil fuel restrictions baked into the state’s Clean Economy Act in response to the energy crunch.

Industry efforts to advance data centers have also been targeted at both parties. The nearly quarter of a million dollars the Data Center Coalition has poured into state legislative campaigns in Virginia have been split across the aisle. The group has spent nearly the same amount on federal lobbying and is active in states like California, where it spent $50,000 so far this year. Other players in the sector are targeting northern Virginia officials, too.

“Data centers enjoy bipartisan support across states, but we have also heard our fair share of bipartisan concerns across states,” said Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group. “We are very much an engaged stakeholder in all the states in which our members are active in to work on policies with lawmakers of both sides of the aisle to ensure that states continue to see the economic benefits of data centers while also addressing their priorities.”

As data centers move up the ballot as a campaign issue, the complications for candidates in both parties are playing out in real time. Democrats who are watching their party nationally hemorrhage voters over the economy are scrambling to strike a balance between adding jobs and revenue while stopping energy costs from skyrocketing. And in some cases, Republicans whose party leaders are cracking down on renewable energy are calling for “all of the above” approaches to energy production to keep power prices down — providing tacit backing to a sector Trump is trying to crush even as they follow the president in promoting fossil fuels.

That dynamic is on clear display in Virginia’s gubernatorial race, where data-center regulation has emerged as a focal point. Former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Democrats’ nominee, is proposing a “statewide strategy” for data centers that calls for boosting local and renewable energy production and charging Big Tech companies to offset rising energy costs for consumers.

“Virginia can benefit from having data centers here — but to reap those benefits, we need to make sure we are accounting and planning for the energy generation, water, and other resources needed to support them,” Spanberger said in a statement.

Her Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, wants to open the state to “all kinds of energy” and to reduce red tape around power projects to help meet increasing demand. Earle-Sears’ campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

Rising power prices, which could spike further as more energy-demanding data centers come online, are already roiling politics across the midwest and mid-Atlantic as Democratic governors and candidates blame grid manager PJM for consumers’ higher bills and New Jersey’s gubernatorial candidates clash over how to bring those costs down.

The debate has the potential to spill into next year’s broader slate of gubernatorial contests, with several of those governors — including Pritzker, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Maryland’s Wes Moore — up for reelection and Democrats eager to prove they understand voters’ cost-of-living concerns.

The issues surrounding data centers are bleeding into federal politics, too, though ultimately decisions around zoning and electric rates will largely remain in state and local control. Congressional Republicans had pushed a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulations — including those around data center permitting — as part of their “big, beautiful” domestic policy bill, though the effort fell apart in the Senate. At the same time, they voted to roll back credits for clean-energy projects from Democrats’ 2022 climate law that could help offset rising energy demand.

“The federal government is going to have to take this on,” said Virginia state Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat who has spearheaded data center regulatory efforts in her legislature. “In the interim, the state is going to be at the forefront for dealing with it, and it’s going to be bipartisan.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffc%2Fa0%2Ff976eca94f1aa78d9b6a6ed6624b%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2161850979,N,,2025-08-10 15:06:17.137927

Not only was this wind turbine project renewable, but it was also extremely big and powerful, and would be the driving force behind Rivian’s new R1 EVs, making their first charge green.
The never-before-seen wind turbine project Rivian partnered with the Virginia-based renewable energy company for its wind turbine project.
According to Rivian, this wind turbine has a 2.8 MW capacity and can supply almost 10 million kWh of power annually.
Who knows, soon other wind turbine projects such as this one may follow suit.","This American automaker has undergone quite a few transitions over the past few years, but since 2011, its vision has become crystal clear. The company has set its sights on playing a major role in the Climate Pledge to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2040, and plans on achieving it with the 10,000,000 kWh from a megascale wind turbine. The entire setup is something that has never been seen before.

The renewable driving force behind these vehicles

The American automaker Rivian was founded in Florida as Mainstream Motors. After rebranding, it became known as Avera Motors and eventually Rivian. In 2011, Rivian set its sights on electric vehicles (EVs), such as trucks and SUVs. The company set a long-term renewable energy vision, which entailed the manufacturing of high-impact projects to decrease its carbon footprint and simultaneously aid communities, customers, and the power grid.

At the beginning of 2022, the company installed a 783 kW solar canopy at its shipping charging area. Later that year, the company announced its plans to install a large-scale wind turbine at its production site, which formed part of its long-term renewable energy vision. Not only was this wind turbine project renewable, but it was also extremely big and powerful, and would be the driving force behind Rivian’s new R1 EVs, making their first charge green.

The never-before-seen wind turbine project

Rivian partnered with the Virginia-based renewable energy company for its wind turbine project. The turbine, once constructed, was less than 510 feet in length. It’s white and has non-reflective blades, and it was installed on the east side of the company’s production site, inside the vehicle test track. According to Rivian, this wind turbine has a 2.8 MW capacity and can supply almost 10 million kWh of power annually. That is enough to charge 150,000 EVs annually.

“To us, our job isn’t done when our vehicles come off the line. While we’re working hard to help electrify transportation, we’re also pushing to accelerate the shift to carbon-free electricity for all. This wind turbine is an early step on that path, and it’s also a beacon of our vision for a clean energy future.” – Andrew Peterman, Rivian Director of Renewable Energy

This entire project also aligns with the automaker’s game plan of installing renewable resources in regions in the country with the highest need. The company also agreed to the Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the global zero-carbon mission by 2050.

Advantages beyond power production

Now, many people know that traditional wind turbines come with some disadvantages, which, according to Blue and Green Tomorrow, include but are not limited to:

Visual pollution

Noise pollution

Harmful to the surrounding wildlife

Thankfully, Rivian did its homework and researched the project’s potential impacts due to sound and shadow flicker, and its potential impact on endangered species, communication systems, and cultural resources. These impact studies highlighted the following advantages:

It has low noise pollution, as it produces limited sound with an average of 35 decibels and a maximum of 42 decibels (the same as a refrigerator)

Throughout 25 years, it could diminish 177,000 tons of carbon-equivalent emissions (the same as removing 34,000 internal combustion engine vehicles from the roads for one year)

The fact that the turbine has been installed on the company’s production site means that visual pollution is not a concern, especially considering its length.

It is one thing to implement renewable energy sources into your company, but the responsible construction management and necessary environmental impact studies play a crucial role in ensuring that the entire project remains green. Rivian has proven its dedication to keeping its carbon footprint small and to achieving its goal of adhering to the Climate Pledge. Who knows, soon other wind turbine projects such as this one may follow suit.

Of these 63 vetoes, 37 vetoes were accompanied by alternative solutions proposed by the executive.
Belchior announced that a provisional measure establishing the implementation of the LAE – special environmental licensing—will be signed by President Lula, thus authorizing environmental licensing for “economically strategic” businesses, irrespective of their environmental impact.","President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has approved, with significant vetoes, Brazil’s new law on environmental licensing. The law—commonly referred to as the “devastation bill”—had been approved by Congress on the 17th of July.

In a press conference held on Friday, August 8, Brazil’s environmental minister, Marina Silva, said the government focused on “strategic” vetoes that would “preserve the integrity of environmental licensing”. Silva added that the government’s vetoes sought balance so that “ecology does not clash with the economy”.

During the press conference, Miriam Belchior, Brazil’s Executive Secretary of the Civil House, added that the government’s vetoes aim to “safeguard the rights of Indigenous and quilombola peoples” and to “incorporate innovations that streamline licensing without compromising quality”.

President Lula vetoed 63 of the almost 400 provisions that were approved by Congress. Of these 63 vetoes, 37 vetoes were accompanied by alternative solutions proposed by the executive.

Lula’s government notably vetoed the provision which extended LAC– license by adhesion and commitment—to projects that fall under medium polluting potential. This would mean licensing would be granted through self-declared online forms, eliminating vital impact studies processes.

The provision which allowed for different licensing requirements and processes for attaining licenses in different states was also vetoed.

President Lula’s government also vetoed the bill’s provision which would diminish the power of consulting political organs responsible for protecting quilombolas and Indigenous rights, like Fundação Palmares and FUNAI.

New rules regarding Indigenous and quilombolas (communities of descendants from black slaves who resisted Brazil’s slavery regime) will be proposed by the government and sent to Congress. The bill’s provision which proposed eliminating special protection for the Atlantic Rainforest—an area which is already degraded with only 24% of its original area remaining—was also vetoed.

Belchior announced that a provisional measure establishing the implementation of the LAE – special environmental licensing—will be signed by President Lula, thus authorizing environmental licensing for “economically strategic” businesses, irrespective of their environmental impact. Such a measure will come into force once it’s published in the Official Gazette of the Union, although Congress must also approve it within 120 days for its continued validity.

The new Environmental Licensing Law with President Lula’s 63 vetoes has been sent to Congress in an emergency regime, and the vetoes will be analysed by Congress in joint sessions between the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.

At Friday’s press conference ministers stressed that both the provisional measure and the modified bill are intended to serve as “dialogue” with Congress, avoiding “possible judicialization of environmental licensing”.

However, with Congress approving the original bill by a majority, there is still a possibility that the president’s vetoes will be overturned.",https://brazilreports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GxtbmLYWoAAYvlt-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 15:07:12.114480

The US has devolved from a widely respected global powerhouse into the personal self-dealing tool of a convicted felon with astonishing speed, so it’s no surprise to see the promise of a thriving domestic offshore wind industry kneecapped by the White House. Along with direct job losses from canceled projects, the supply chain fallout will bleed thousands of jobs from more than three dozen states, and that’s not even counting missed opportunities for the concrete industry. Yes, the concrete industry.

Offshore Wind And The Concrete Connection

Conventional offshore wind farms are built in relatively shallow waters, where the turbines can perch on top of tall steel monopiles fixed into the seabed. Back in 2022, the US Department of Energy assessed the potential for using steel-reinforced concrete as a much less expensive alternative for monopile turbine foundations, but concluded that more research into stress and fatigue issues was needed.

New research on North Sea wind farms in the UK indicates that the floating offshore wind field is a more immediate opportunity for the concrete industry. As applied to the US, that includes long swaths of deepwater coastline unsuitable for fixed monopiles, including practically all of the energy-thirsty West Coast as well as Maine on the East Coast (see more floating wind background here).

The new study was produced by the UK offshore wind consultancy group OpenWater Renewables, which focuses on floating platforms. “Concrete foundations could be the best option for developers of floating offshore wind farms in the North Sea,” the firm summarized in a posting on the Technology Leadership Board website.

“The material’s durability, low maintenance requirements, lower capital expenditure (CAPEX) and suitability for UK construction could provide a competitive alternative to steel designs,” they added, while advising that developers are challenged by the wide variety of materials choices.

The study is significant because it is available on an open-source basis. “Whilst private wind farm developers and others have performed similar analyses, their results are generally not available in the public domain,” OpenWater explains.

Sorting Through The Floating Wind Variables

TLB’s membership is frontloaded with oil and gas stakeholders, spearheaded by TotalEnergies and the North Sea Transition Authority in collaboration with other North Sea stakeholders. Still, TLB also reflects the extent to which legacy energy firms are transitioning into renewables.

OpenWater deployed its proprietary ranking software to formulate a roster of economically viable floating wind platform options in the North Sea. Making the shortlist were 15 concepts, including three barges, 11 semi-submersible platforms, and one tension leg platform.

Before you get too excited, none of the concepts has achieved Technology Readiness Level 9. TRL is a standard ranking system ranging from back-of-the-napkin Level 1 on up to a successful record of operation at Level 9. Of the 15 options selected by OpenWater, none reached higher than Level 7, the prototype level.

On the plus side, none of the 15 options ranked lower than 5, which refers to successful component tests in the target environment.

Next Steps For The US Offshore Wind Industry

“Critical factors included installation, CAPEX and operating expenditure, financial strength, and project track record. Technical maturity was also a key factor in assessing the concepts,” OpenWater notes, adding that weather conditions in the North Sea also influenced its choices.

“For North Sea projects, ease of installation and repair were seen as key differentiators due to the short weather windows in which critical work has to be done,” OpenWater observes.

If you caught that thing about “short weather window,” that’s where things get interesting for the US offshore wind industry. The North Sea sits farther up the latitude ladder than the US Pacific coast. All else being equal, a larger weather window would improve the economic outlook for new floating offshore wind farms in Hawaii as well as Washington, Oregon, and California.

Except, not. In yet another in a series of anti-wind measures, on Friday, US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced a complete overhaul of his agency’s offshore wind regulations.

“We’re taking a results-driven approach that prioritizes reliability, strengthens national security and upholds both scientific integrity and responsible environmental stewardship,” Burgum said in a press release that also included a reminder that Burgum didn’t mean any of it.

“This effort also supports Executive Order 14315, which directs agencies to identify and eliminate favoritism toward unreliable energy sources,” DOI reminded everyone.

“The Department has paused new approvals for offshore wind projects—including leases, permits, rights-of-way and loans—in compliance with the Presidential Memorandum on wind energy, while it conducts a review of offshore wind energy projects and their impact on the environment, national security and the economy,” they added.

Who Voted For This Guy Anyways?

If you caught that thing about “unreliable,” that’s where everything circles back around to personal self-dealing. As helpfully explained by the Interior Department, the White House has adopted a specious definition of energy security in which domestic energy resources are separated into intermittent availability and non-intermittent. That made sense back in the 20th century when both wind and solar power were just a speck on the horizon. However, “reliability” is a poor measure of energy security in the 21st century environment of new energy storage and grid management technologies.

The reliable/unreliable separation does fulfill one key goal. It helps provide US President Donald Trump with cover to pursue his widely reported and highly personal vendetta against wind turbines, without singling out wind alone as a matter of public policy. The “unreliable” canard leaves the US solar industry twisting in the wind, so to speak, alongside the wind industry, while three other significant domestic renewable energy resources — hydropower, biomass, and geothermal — have been left largely untouched, simply because they fit neatly into the 24/7 baseload power generation silo of Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” plan.

On the other hand, Trump ditched many norms of public policy during his first term in office and his 2024 campaign for another turn around the Oval Office foretold of a more thorough trashing of public resources and systems to come. That has all materialized, in spades. Thanks to whoever voted for this guy, the entirety of federal policy is mere putty for his fevered brain to manipulate, with the Republican majority in both the US House and Senate marching happily along in lockstep.

Still, US Presidents come and go, and this one will leave office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully, one hopes, this time.

Of course, there were automobiles before Ford launched the Model T more than a century ago. But the Model T, an inexpensive reliable car, changed the automotive industry.

This week, Ford is introducing a next generation electric vehicle that will be roughly half the price of EVs on the road today.

At the news conference, leaders with the Dearborn automaker will share plans to design and assemble electric vehicles in America.

On a July 30 conference call with analysts, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the new vehicles are intended to compete with Chinese EV makers, like Geely and BYD.

“We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese over the globe on EVs is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process,” Farley told the analysts.

A key component are new Lithium-ion phosphate batteries to be produced in Marshall, Michigan.

It should also be noted this Model T Moment is being announced in Kentucky, not Michigan.

This week’s announcement comes as Ford is delaying other aspects of its EV product line.

Delays in scaling up domestic solar production slow the country’s ability to cut climate pollution.","ARIZONA – A major solar manufacturer has shut down its U.S. facility before production fully took off — a move that has sparked backlash and renewed concern over the country’s ability to support clean energy jobs. One culprit cited was the Trump Administration’s cancellation of solar credits.

What’s happening?

As Electrek detailed, Swiss solar company Meyer Burger closed its Arizona factory in May and laid off 282 employees after stating it couldn’t secure the funding necessary to continue operating.

The Goodyear facility was supposed to produce 1.4 gigawatts of solar panels annually — enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes — but the company never reached full production.

Meyer Burger blamed a severe lack of funds, worsened by a canceled 5-gigawatt supply agreement with cleaner energy investor D.E. Shaw, and fierce competition from Chinese imports.

On June 27 — just weeks after the shutdown — Meyer Burger’s U.S. branch filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, following insolvency proceedings for its parent company in Germany.

Reactions have been intense — and not just from workers. One commenter on Electrek summed up a growing concern: “It won’t be much longer before more companies follow. Future investment in the U.S. by foreign companies? Notta.”

Why is this facility shutdown concerning?

This shutdown is a blow not just to workers in Arizona but to a broader push for clean energy in the U.S. The Goodyear factory was part of an effort to shift solar production away from heavily subsidized Chinese supply chains and create sustainable American jobs in the process.

However, a lack of clear, timely support left Meyer Burger stranded — and it highlights a deeper issue facing the U.S. clean energy sector.

Following the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill, many clean energy incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act are set to be phased out. The removal of these benefits could have a disastrous impact on green-energy companies.

When clean energy projects like this fall through, the ripple effects extend beyond job losses. Delays in scaling up domestic solar production slow the country’s ability to cut climate pollution.

First, it helps build up domestic energy storage capacity in a cost-effective and efficient manner.
As a result, utilities need to ramp up energy storage installation to stabilize inflows and outflows of energy to maintain profitability and to keep the lights on.

“Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.” As a result, energy storage centers powered by EV batteries are popping up across the nation, and particularly in the Lone Star State.","Used and recycled electric vehicle batteries are getting a second chance at life through energy storage systems across the country. Lithium-ion batteries are retired from their role powering EVs when they still have a lot of life left in them, and repurposing them for one of the fastest-growing energy industry sectors is a no-brainer.

Diverting lithium-ion batteries away from landfill and into storage projects yields multiple overlapping benefits. First, it helps build up domestic energy storage capacity in a cost-effective and efficient manner. According to Dimension Market Research, the global Energy Storage Market is on track to reach USD $204.8 billion by 2033, up from USD 58.9 billion in 2024. This represents a massive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.8%.

As renewable energy sources become more prevalent in the national energy mix, energy prices become more volatile and can even dip into the negatives when supply outpaces demand. This is because wind and solar energy are variable, meaning that they produce energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, irrespective of demand. As a result, utilities need to ramp up energy storage installation to stabilize inflows and outflows of energy to maintain profitability and to keep the lights on.

The second benefit is that reusing EV batteries for energy storage avoids throwing away critical minerals including lithium, nickel and cobalt at a time when supplies for those elements are growing increasingly tight. Currently, China has a chokehold on a huge number of critical mineral supply chains, and reusing batteries helps avoid tariffs and geopolitical complications. Plus, reclaiming critical minerals instead of purchasing new supplies avoids negative environmental impacts associated with mining and refining those minerals.

Third, battery storage provides a safety net for EV battery makers at a time when the market is cooling down in the face of major and unprecedented political pressures. BloombergNEF has lowered both its near- and long-term outlooks for EV sales in the United States for the first time ever as the Trump administration walks back Biden-era policies designed to boost electric vehicle adoption. The new numbers paint a grim picture for battery makers, but energy storage projects could provide a game-saving strategy.

Already, major automotive companies are taking notice and beginning to pivot. Last month, GM signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding” with Redwood Energy to begin a used-battery powered storage venture intended to serve as an external power bank for data centers.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, General Motors’ vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability, in a recent statement. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars — we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

The use of batteries as power banks for data centers could also prove to be a critical solution to another major energy issue of the moment. As artificial intelligence places unprecedented strain on power grids and raises the United States’ energy demands after decades of stasis, alternative energy solutions are critical for energy security as well as decarbonization efforts.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said Redwood founder and CEO JB Straubel. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

As a result, energy storage centers powered by EV batteries are popping up across the nation, and particularly in the Lone Star State. While the sector is relatively small now, it’s going to grow at a breakneck pace. And the timing could not be better, as first-generation EVs begin to proffer a steady stream of retired batteries.

Losing them overnight makes many deals uneconomical, especially for first-time EV buyers.
“$7,500 Federal Tax Credit ends Sept 30,” Tesla wrote on X this Sunday.
Earlier this week, the company raised its Model Y lease pricing by up to 14% and ended a free upgrade incentive for both the Model Y and Model 3.
Latecomers have must place their orders by August 11 for the Model Y and August 18 for the Model 3 to take advantage of it.","The great EV buying frenzy has officially begun. In the last 48 hours, Tesla has seen delivery times for some of its most popular models skyrocket from a few weeks to nearly six months, a clear signal that consumers are stampeding to buy an electric vehicle before a crucial federal tax credit disappears for good.

This is the short-term sales boom that experts have been predicting, a last-chance gold rush for buyers. But for the EV industry, it’s also a sugar rush that could lead to a brutal crash.

The Deadline That Sparked the Madness

The cause of the chaos is the impending expiration of the federal EV tax credits. The credits—a key part of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—provided a $7,500 incentive for a new EV and $4,000 for a used one, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for many buyers. Losing them overnight makes many deals uneconomical, especially for first-time EV buyers.

Under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, those credits will officially end on September 30. After that date, the price of a new EV will effectively jump by $7,500 overnight.

Anticipating this, automakers have been bracing for a surge of consumers looking to lock in the savings. Now, the first signs from Tesla, the undisputed market leader, prove the experts were right.

As of Sunday, consumers placing an order for most variants of the Model 3 sedan and all variants of the best-selling Model Y SUV were given a delivery estimate of four to six months, a massive jump from the one-to-three-week estimate seen just two days prior, Gizmodo found. This indicates that Tesla’s current inventory is being rapidly depleted by the surge in demand.

The Catch: You Have to Take Delivery

The long wait times are creating a high-stakes drama for buyers because of a critical rule: to qualify for the tax credit, you don’t just have to order the car by the deadline, you must take delivery of it. This is a point Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, are now urgently emphasizing.

“$7,500 Federal Tax Credit ends Sept 30,” Tesla wrote on X this Sunday. “You’ll need to take delivery – not just place an order – by that date to make use of the credit before it’s gone.”

Musk reposted the message, adding an even more alarming note: “Important re-timing of vehicle delivery.” The message is clear: if you wait too long, you’ll miss out.

Tesla Capitalizes on the Chaos

With demand surging and customers growing desperate, Tesla is already capitalizing on the situation. Earlier this week, the company raised its Model Y lease pricing by up to 14% and ended a free upgrade incentive for both the Model Y and Model 3. Latecomers have must place their orders by August 11 for the Model Y and August 18 for the Model 3 to take advantage of it.

The sudden changes, made with no warning, have frustrated some buyers.

“I am sick to vomiting with Tesla doing this to pull demand when they can’t do basic advertising/educating/public relations,” one user posted on X. “Every other company does it. It was cute when Tesla was a startup no more.”

This sales frenzy comes after a brutal second quarter for the automaker, which saw its deliveries fall 13.5% and its net revenue drop 16.3% compared to the previous year as it grappled with brand damage from Musk’s political activities.

What’s the problem? Gas-powered leaf blowers are greater polluters than cars, pound for pound, since their engines are smaller and often less efficient. Using a commercial gas-powered leaf blower for one hour creates as much smog-forming pollution as driving a light-duty car for more than 15 hours, according to the California Air Resources Board.

Leaf blowers also kick up particulate matter, which can cause respiratory and heart problems. Plus, gas-powered versions of the lawn care tool can hit 106 decibels, enough to damage hearing, per the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.

Changing landscape

An increasing number of communities are trying to keep gas-powered leaf blowers off the streets, according to USA Today:

California has a statewide ban on selling them, though many cities there take it a step further and prohibit using them at all.

In Washington, DC, using a gas-powered leaf blower could land you a $500 fine.

In a strategic partnership, the Department of Energy (DOE) has signed a lease with General Matter Inc. for the development of a new uranium enrichment facility. Situated on a 100-acre plot of land at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky, this initiative marks a pivotal step towards reducing dependency on foreign nuclear fuel sources. The project signifies a broader effort to fortify national security, enhance energy production, and support scientific research, setting the stage for a new era in the U.S. nuclear sector.

DOE’s Push for Building Domestic Supply Chains for Nuclear Fuel

The DOE’s decision to partner with General Matter Inc. is part of a larger strategy to develop a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuels. In October 2024, the department selected four companies, including General Matter, for uranium enrichment services aimed at producing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). This initiative is crucial for the reshoring and expansion of energy resources, particularly for advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence data centers.

Building domestic supply chains is not merely an economic decision but also a strategic one. The DOE emphasizes that nuclear fuel enrichment is vital for national security, commercial energy production, and research reactors. By investing in domestic capabilities, the U.S. aims to reduce its reliance on international suppliers, particularly from countries like Russia, which have traditionally been significant exporters of nuclear fuel to the United States.

General Matter’s role in fuel-line development is an important component in rebuilding America’s nuclear fuel production base. The partnership seeks to transform the former Paducah site into a key contributor to the nation’s nuclear energy leadership, aligning with broader governmental goals of energy independence and security.

General Matter to Set Up the Uranium Enrichment Facility

Under the lease agreement, General Matter will utilize the 100-acre federal land parcel to establish a uranium enrichment facility. Construction is slated to begin in 2026, with operations expected to commence by the decade’s end. This timeline reflects the urgent need to revitalize domestic uranium processing capabilities in a rapidly changing global energy landscape.

The lease also grants access to a minimum of 7,600 cylinders of existing uranium hexafluoride, which will be reprocessed to supply fuel for future operations. According to the DOE, this initiative will save American taxpayers approximately $800 million by avoiding disposal costs.

Roger Jarrell, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the DOE Office of Environmental Management, emphasized the significance of leveraging the Paducah site’s resources. He noted that the skilled workforce and existing infrastructure at the site are pivotal in attracting private funding and accelerating commercial licensing activities. This approach aligns with broader governmental efforts to reduce barriers to energy development and transform liabilities into opportunities.

Understanding Uranium Enrichment and Its Importance

Uranium enrichment is a critical process in the production of nuclear fuel. Natural uranium contains only about 0.7% of the isotope U-235, which is necessary for nuclear reactions. Enrichment increases the concentration of U-235 to levels suitable for use in reactors. This is typically achieved by converting uranium oxide into uranium hexafluoride (UF6), which can then be processed in enrichment facilities.

The enriched uranium produced is essential for various applications, from powering commercial nuclear reactors to fueling research reactors and supporting national security initiatives. The process of uranium enrichment is complex and requires significant technological and infrastructural investments, underscoring the importance of developing domestic capabilities.

As the U.S. seeks to transition to cleaner energy sources, nuclear power remains a key component of its energy strategy. Ensuring a stable, domestic supply of enriched uranium is crucial for maintaining energy security and meeting the nation’s growing power needs.

Implications for National Security and Energy Independence

The push for domestic nuclear fuel production is not just about energy independence; it is also a matter of national security. The geopolitical landscape surrounding nuclear fuel is complex, with countries like Russia wielding significant influence due to their control over large portions of the global supply chain.

The U.S. administration has recognized the risks of relying on foreign sources for critical energy infrastructure. By investing in domestic enrichment facilities, the U.S. aims to mitigate these risks and enhance its geopolitical leverage. This strategy also supports the development of advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, which are being explored to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

As the international community continues to grapple with energy security concerns, the U.S. is positioning itself as a leader in the nuclear energy sector. The establishment of a domestic uranium enrichment facility is a significant step towards achieving this goal, ensuring that the nation remains at the forefront of clean energy innovation.

The U.S. government’s initiative to revitalize domestic uranium enrichment is a critical component of its broader energy strategy. By reducing dependence on foreign sources and investing in advanced nuclear technologies, the U.S. is taking proactive steps towards ensuring energy security and sustainability. As the world shifts towards cleaner energy solutions, how will these developments shape the future of global energy dynamics?

Ultimately, Washington is likely to lose renewable energy projects because of the added complications, Blackmon said.","Details about how President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” will change life for everyday Americans are still emerging more than a month after Congress passed the sweeping legislation.

Even some politicians who voted in favor of the bill, which passed with a razor-thin margin, didn’t understand what it would do. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said she would have voted against the measure if she had fully understood its contents.

Here in Washington state, energy experts and policy wonks are coming to understand that it’s going to mean higher electrical bills.

Precisely when your bills will rise and by how much remain somewhat unclear. But the tax plan will eliminate single-family tax credits, hand out billions to fossil fuel companies and hamstring the very wind, solar and battery projects Washington state is scrambling to build.

The money lost will soar into the billions, according to some estimates.

In the face of widespread voter opposition, illuminated by numerous polls across the country, Republicans in Congress rallied around the bill, squeezing votes out of even their most squeamish party members. Trump and his allies sold the plan as the “largest tax cut in history for middle- and working-class Americans.”

In reality, the average family earning less than $50,000 would save less than $300 in 2027 under the tax plan, while those earning $1 million or more would save around $90,000, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Two House Republicans voted against the measure. Washington’s two GOP representatives, Dan Newhouse and Mike Baumgartner, both voted in favor, and neither responded to requests for comment on the topic.

Democrats repeatedly warned that the bill would cut popular programs like Medicaid and SNAP and add trillions to the national debt. Now that it’s law, there appears to be little they can do to offset damage to the renewable energy industry. Politicians and state and local officials talk about challenging the law in court and raising their voices in opposition. Concrete policy proposals to keep rates from rising are few and far between.

The tax plan, broadly seen as the linchpin to Trump’s agenda during his second term, marks the president’s latest shot in his escalating fight against climate science. He’s doubling down on planet-warming fossil fuels and gutting environmental and climate regulations. The latest move amounts to a setback of gargantuan proportions for the renewable industry that boomed under President Joe Biden.

As the political battle plays out, ratepayers in Washington will be forced to absorb higher electrical bills as the cost to build new wind, solar and battery projects increases by perhaps 30% or more.

“It’s going to impact our jobs; it’s going to make your electricity more expensive,” Joe Nguyễn, who directs Washington’s Department of Commerce, said during a roundtable discussion late last month. “And, candidly, it could make us more risky for brownouts or blackouts.”

Now, Washington state, utilities and developers are scrambling to figure out how to pick up the pieces.

Loss of individual tax credits

The quickest way this bill will hit home for some is with the elimination of residential clean energy credits and similar policies. Those credits might have helped the typical household in Washington save between $390 and $900 a year, Washington’s senior Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said at the roundtable discussion.

People who installed rooftop solar panels, heat pumps or similar devices were eligible for a tax credit worth 30% of their cost, but that offering will end by Dec. 31.

Not only are those potential savings gone but the residential clean-energy market could be cut in half or worse, Murray said.

The bill also eliminates a $7,500 consumer rebate for some electric vehicles and a credit for those seeking to audit their home’s energy use and renovations to become more energy-efficient.

Washington state still offers some incentives for these types of purchases, but the money available pales in comparison to the outgoing federal credits and rebates.

Renewable energy projects in jeopardy

Washington stands to lose an estimated $8.7 billion in clean-energy investments, Murray said.

The tax bill phases out credits for large-scale wind and solar farms or battery storage, eliminating Biden-era subsidies that could have cut costs by nearly a third.

Renewable energy project developers proposing work across the state declined to comment on this article for fear of further attracting Trump’s ire.

Take a project like the Horse Heaven Hills wind farm in Benton County. It was originally estimated to cost about $1.7 billion. A 30% investment credit could have cut costs by around $510 million.

Those credits are now largely out the window. Unless a project can be finished by the end of 2027 or break ground by next summer, it won’t qualify.

For context, the Horse Heaven Hills project took around three years just to win the permits needed to start work, and even then, the size of the wind farm was greatly reduced. The developer is still arguing over part of that project in court.

That truncated timeline could be enough to kill a project outright or dramatically shrink its footprint, Glenn Blackmon, manager of Washington’s Energy Policy Office, said in an interview. Other developers might back out because the finances no longer pencil out.

Ultimately, Washington is likely to lose renewable energy projects because of the added complications, Blackmon said.

That’s a problem because Washington needs more clean energy to replace outgoing fossil fuel sources and meet surging demand made and the increasing prevalence of power-hungry data centers.

Whatever renewable projects still make it through the pipeline will be more expensive, and that added cost will be passed on to ratepayers, Blackmon said.

“It doesn’t take a real fancy economic model to think ‘Well, if you increase the price by 30% or 40%, then the cost of electricity is going to be higher,’ ” Blackmon said.

But why must Washington move forward with only renewable energy projects?

The Clean Energy Transformation Act

The first answer to that question is climate change. Fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas are warming our planet. So in 2019, lawmakers in Washington passed the Clean Energy Transformation Act, or CETA for short.

Among other things, CETA requires coal plants in Washington to be closed by the end of the year and it requires the state to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045.

So any new energy projects built to meet the rising demand must tap into renewable sources like wind or solar. Hydropower is also on the table, but proposals for new dams are few and far between, and the resource is also suffering from ongoing drought conditions fueled by global warming.

For Seattle City Light, rising demand means the utility must double the amount of available electricity in the next nine years, CEO Dawn Lindell said at the roundtable discussion. Not only will the tax plan hike the cost of all that new energy by perhaps as much as 20% but it’s also a step in the wrong direction for a rapidly warming planet.

“Now is not the time to put our head in the sand,” Lindell said.

Puget Sound Energy, the state’s largest utility, is in a similar position, said Matt Steuerwalt, the utility’s vice president of external affairs. Regardless of whether the tax incentives are revoked, the utility must buy more renewable energy. Once those projects begin generating power, that added cost will then be reflected in customers’ bills, he said.

While the loss of these tax incentives will mean prices trend upward, Blackmon said there might be a silver lining. Fossil fuel prices remain volatile while renewables are trending downward. So in the long run, Washington’s transition toward wind and solar will still be the more affordable option.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08042025_TZR_Horse_Heaven_Hills-03012025_tzr_125616.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:24.553954

WV Rivers will continue working toward a long-term resolution that holds all parties to permitted standards and ensures transparency and accountability around pollution discharges.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – A federal judge has granted the West Virginia Rivers Coalition’s (WV Rivers) request for a preliminary injunction, requiring The Chemours Company FC, LLC (Chemours) to reduce discharges of HFPO-DA, a “forever chemical” also known as Gen-X, from its Washington Works facility in Wood County. The ruling states that the company must operate within its Clean Water Act permit and demonstrate sustained compliance with the discharge limits.

As the Court explained, “For years, Defendant Chemours Company has discharged pollutants into the Ohio River. The level of discharge far exceeds the legal limits that bind Chemours. Those pollutants endanger the environment, aquatic life, and human health. Today, that unlawful, unpermitted discharge stops.”

“This is a victory for public health and the Ohio River,” said Autumn Crowe, Deputy Director of WV Rivers. “The Court recognized what communities have known for years: Chemours has been polluting our water and ignoring its legal obligations.”

WV Rivers, represented by Appalachian Mountain Advocates and Public Justice, filed the lawsuit in response to ongoing discharges of Gen-X chemicals into the Ohio River, which serves as a drinking water source for approximately 5 million people. Chemours had been exceeding permitted limits for many years with increasing frequency and severity. In November 2024, Chemours exceeded its permitted limits for HFPO-DA at Outlet 002 and Outlet 005 as high as 454% and 166%, respectively.

The Court’s decision acknowledges that the permit limits under the Clean Water Act are designed to prevent long-term, incremental harm to people and ecosystems and that Chemours has been ignoring it to the detriment of communities downstream: “Defendant’s permit is not a suggestion; rather, its permit protects public health and environmental life while balancing the needs of manufacturing. But I cannot weigh the scales of that balance to inflict further harm on the communities that rely on clean water for life and livelihood. The Clean Water Act protects the public, and I will enforce it.”

The Court found that Gen-X chemicals are dangerous, persistent, and mobile pollutants. It also found that each unlawful discharge of those chemicals is a direct toxic exposure that causes irreparable harm to every person served by downstream drinking water systems.

“The Court’s decision is an especially strong endorsement of the value of citizen suits in enforcing the Clean Water Act,” said Jim Hecker, Senior Environmental Enforcement Attorney at Public Justice. “The Court’s opinion emphasized that Congress gave citizens that enforcement power ‘precisely for cases like this one,’ where a polluter violates its permit for years and the government fails to enforce the law.”

The Court’s preliminary injunction orders Chemours to comply with its permit immediately and to “take any measures necessary to achieve and maintain compliance, including but not limited to production changes, process modifications, off-site treatment, or temporary cessation of operations.”

“The Court made clear that Chemours has many ways to come into compliance, and thus protect the public, while continuing to operate. Our intent has never been to cause layoffs but rather has always been straightforward: to ensure compliance with environmental safeguards to protect the health and well-being of the public,” said Jennie Smith, Executive Director of WV Rivers.

Hydro says that the sixth and final generating unit on the Site C hydroelectric megaproject in northeast B.C. is now online.

The massive energy project has been under construction since 2015, and its first generating unit became operational last October, when power began being supplied to the grid.

At $16 billion, nearly double of its initial price tag, Site C is considered B.C.'s most expensive infrastructure project.

It went ahead despite court cases from First Nations and other groups, some of which decried the impact of flooding land and changing the course of the massive Peace River in northeast B.C.

Site C was initially approved by the then-B.C. Liberal government in 2010, and the project stayed on course after a review by the B.C. NDP government in 2017.

B.C. Hydro estimates the dam will be able to provide 5,100 gigawatt hours of electricity each year, adding eight per cent to the province's total production capacity.

The hydroelectric project draws from an 83-kilometre-long reservoir, which covers an area of about 5,550 hectares of land, 25 times the size of Stanley Park.

It was filled in with water starting last August, and Energy Minister Adrian Dix said that ""generations of British Columbians"" would benefit from the clean electricity generated by the project.

""The commission of Site C's final generating unit is another step forward to securing B.C.'s clean energy future,"" he said in a statement.

Hazards in area: B.C. Hydro

B.C. Hydro says that, now that the final generating unit is operational, future construction work at Site C will consist of completing the powerhouse and generating station and paving access roads.

The utility estimates it will serve B.C. Hydro customers for the next century, and is now providing enough electricity to power 500,000 homes.

""Work also continues to backfill the tunnels used to divert the Peace River, and revegetate areas no longer required for construction,"" a statement from B.C. Hydro reads.

The utility says that there continue to be a number of hazards in the area around Site C and the surrounding slopes, and it's urging members of the public to stay away for now.

""These potential hazards include floating vegetation debris and the surrounding land and shoreline continuing to stabilize,"" the statement reads.

""The new B.C. Hydro public boat launches will open when the reservoir is deemed safe, which is expected to be spring 2026 at the earliest.""

First Nation opposition

The project was not completed without controversy and opposition.

In 2018, the West Moberly First Nation lost a bid for an injunction order against the project, having argued that the dam would cause irreparable harm to the nation's territory and way of life — rights protected under Treaty 8. The Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs called the ruling a ""grave disappointment.""

Later, in 2022, the nation came to a partial settlement with B.C. Hydro and the provincial and federal governments.

It included an impact and benefits agreement between, 5,000 acres of provincial Crown land transferred to the First Nation and an agreement to release West Moberly's claims against the Site C project.

At the time, Chief Roland Willson told CBC News he had been reluctant to settle out of court, but his community felt it was out of options.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7605261.1754765217!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/site-c-dam.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-10 15:06:39.144978

CATL suspends lithium mine production due to expired permit, highlighting the complex interplay between regulatory compliance, economic viability, and strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving industry.","CATL's Lithium Mine Suspension: Regulatory Challenges and Market Impact

In a significant development for the global battery supply chain, CATL has announced a temporary shutdown at its Jianxiawo lithium mine in Yichun, Jiangxi province. This sudden halt in production could have far-reaching implications for lithium prices, battery manufacturing, and the broader electric vehicle industry.

The Sudden Production Halt

CATL management announced internally that operations at its Jianxiawo mine would be suspended for at least three months, effective August 9, 2025. According to reports from Reuters, the suspension came after the company failed to renew a key mining license that expired on that date.

The Jianxiawo mine represents a crucial link in CATL's vertically integrated battery production strategy. Sources close to the situation indicate that affiliated refineries in Yichun have been formally notified of the closure, with the company preparing for the possibility that the production halt could extend well beyond the initially announced three-month period.

""The company is still in talks with government agencies to renew the license but is preparing for the halt to last months,"" stated one source familiar with the matter. This regulatory hurdle comes at a challenging time for China's lithium industry, which has been facing overcapacity issues for more than two years.

Strategic Significance of the Yichun Operation

Yichun, often referred to as the ""Lithium Capital of Asia,"" hosts critical mineral resources that support China's dominance in the global battery supply chain. The Jianxiawo mine represents a cornerstone of CATL's vertical integration strategy, providing domestic lithium supply that reduces reliance on international markets.

However, the mine has been facing significant economic challenges. Production costs at the facility are approximately RMB 100,000 ($13,920) per ton, according to CnEVPost reporting from September 2024. This cost structure places the operation underwater in the current market environment, where battery-grade lithium carbonate is trading at around RMB 70,000 ($9,744) per ton.

This substantial gap between production costs and market prices raises questions about the economic viability of the operation, potentially complicating the mining permitting process. Regulatory authorities may be considering these economic factors alongside compliance issues in their review of CATL's application.

Impact on the Broader Lithium Market

The suspension comes amid a prolonged downturn in global lithium prices, which have fallen approximately 88% from their November 2022 peak of RMB 590,000 ($82,130) per ton. The current price environment represents a dramatic correction from the 14-fold increase witnessed between June 2020 and November 2022.

For an industry plagued by overcapacity since 2023, the removal of production capacity through CATL's mine suspension could actually provide a stabilizing effect on prices. Analysts suggest this development might offer much-needed relief for other lithium producers facing similar profitability challenges.

The timing aligns with broader trends in the industry. In May 2025, BYD and Tsingshan backed out of lithium cathode plant plans in Chile, citing unfavorable price conditions. These developments collectively point to an industry-wide rationalization phase that could eventually bring supply and demand into better balance.

""CATL's permit trouble and production halt come as the Chinese government is cracking down on overcapacity across multiple industries and intensifying scrutiny of mining operations,"" noted Bloomberg in its report on the suspension.

Regulatory Environment Tightening

The suspension appears to be part of a broader trend of increasing regulatory scrutiny in China's mining sector. Government authorities have been implementing stricter environmental compliance requirements and more rigorous permit review processes across multiple industrial sectors.

This development aligns with China's stated goals of consolidating industries suffering from overcapacity while simultaneously improving environmental standards. The lithium mining sector, which expanded rapidly during the 2020-2022 price boom, is now facing the consequences of that expansion as regulators reassess operations.

The permit renewal process for mining operations typically involves:

Comprehensive environmental impact assessments

Verification of compliance with land use regulations

Review of safety protocols and procedures

Evaluation of community impact and social license to operate

Assessment of resource utilization efficiency

CATL will need to navigate this complex regulatory landscape while demonstrating both compliance and economic viability to secure permit renewal.

Implications for Battery Supply Chains

Lithium represents a significant portion of the cost structure for EV batteries, particularly for lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, which relies on lithium carbonate and iron phosphate as primary raw materials. While CATL maintains a dominant 37.9% global market share in EV batteries as of H1 2025, this supply chain disruption could potentially affect its production costs and competitive positioning.

The company may need to increase sourcing from third-party suppliers to compensate for the production shortfall, potentially:

Increasing input costs for battery production

Creating logistics challenges for material sourcing

Affecting delivery timelines for battery customers

Impacting margins on battery contracts

For automakers relying on CATL's battery supply, these developments warrant close monitoring. While the overall lithium market remains oversupplied, localized disruptions can still create short-term challenges for specific supply chains.

Market Adjustment Expectations

Industry analysts anticipate several potential outcomes from this development:

Short-term price stabilization: The removal of production capacity could help establish a floor for lithium prices that have been in free-fall.

Accelerated industry consolidation: Smaller, higher-cost producers may face increased pressure, potentially leading to mergers or acquisitions.

Increased focus on operational efficiency: Producers across the value chain will likely intensify efforts to reduce costs to remain viable in the current price environment.

Greater emphasis on regulatory compliance: Companies may proactively address potential regulatory issues to avoid similar disruptions.

While the immediate impact may be limited due to overall market oversupply, the psychological effect on market participants could be significant. This high-profile suspension might signal that the industry is finally addressing its overcapacity issues.

Potential Timeline for Resolution

While CATL has not provided specific details on the permit renewal timeline, similar regulatory processes in China's mining sector typically follow a multi-stage review:

Initial application review (1-2 months): Regulatory authorities assess compliance documentation and identify any deficiencies.

Site inspections and verification (2-3 months): Government officials conduct on-site evaluations to verify conditions and compliance status.

Stakeholder consultation (1-2 months): Local communities and other interested parties may be consulted as part of the process.

Final determination (1-2 months): Authorities make a decision on the application, potentially with conditions attached.

Given this typical timeline, CATL's three-month initial suspension estimate appears optimistic unless significant preliminary work had already been completed before the permit expired.

Broader Industry Context

This development occurs against a backdrop of fundamental changes in the lithium market:

Supply growth outpacing demand: Despite rapid EV adoption, lithium production capacity has expanded even faster.

Price sensitivity increasing: Battery manufacturers and automakers are increasingly focused on cost reduction as EV subsidies phase out in many markets.

Geographical concentration risks: China's dominance in lithium processing has prompted concerns about securing lithium supply for other nations.

Technological shifts: Lithium industry innovations and advancements in direct lithium extraction may alter demand patterns over the medium term.

CATL suspends lithium mine production due to expired permit, highlighting the complex interplay between regulatory compliance, economic viability, and strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving industry.

Looking Ahead: What's Next for CATL and the Lithium Market?

The coming months will be critical for CATL as it navigates the permit renewal process. The company must balance immediate operational concerns with its long-term strategic goals of vertical integration and market leadership.

For the broader lithium market, this suspension represents another data point suggesting that the industry is entering a new phase of rationalization after years of explosive growth followed by painful contraction. Industry participants will be watching closely for signs that supply and demand are moving toward a more sustainable equilibrium.

Investors, battery manufacturers, and automakers should prepare for potential volatility in lithium prices as the market digests this development alongside other global lithium insights. While the long-term outlook for lithium demand remains strong, the path to market balance may continue to be bumpy.

“The (EV) market is not massive.","– As growth in electric vehicle (EV) sales slows down in the US and Europe, competition is accelerating in India’s nascent electric car market with the entry of billionaire Elon Musk’s Tesla and Asian carmakers, such as Vietnam’s VinFast and China’s Leapmotor.

India is the world’s third-largest car market in terms of domestic vehicle sales, and it is predicted to overtake the US and China to become the largest by 2030.

The government hopes that electric cars will make up 30 per cent of total car sales by then, up from a mere 2.5 per cent out of the 4.3 million cars sold in 2024.

But India is also a challenging market with price-conscious consumers, limited charging infrastructure, difficult road conditions, and high import duties on foreign cars.

Telsa

drove into the Indian market in July with two variants of its Model Y

, a popular electric sport utility vehicle (SUV), which come with a hefty starting price tag of around US$70,000 (S$90,000), compared with just US$37,490 in the US, according to Forbes India.

A key reason was the import duty, which can rise to 110 per cent, making the SUV more expensive in India than in many other countries.

Tesla, which is currently operating in Mumbai and plans to expand to Delhi, is testing the market, said Mr Srihari Mulgund, India new age mobility partner at EY-Parthenon India, a consulting company.

“They are trying to see how the market perceives the product. There will be learning, and it will help them develop an India product strategy,” he noted.

The government is working to expand infrastructure for charging EVs, which will be key to their acceptance. More than 12,000 EV charging stations were in use nationwide in 2024, and the government aims to have 3.9 million by 2030.

Leading up to Tesla’s entry on July 15, Mr Musk had criticised the high import duties, remarking that they were “the highest in the world by far, of any large country”.

The US is negotiating lower automotive tariffs as part of the India-US trade deal.

Tesla, which competes in the luxury EV sector, has ruled out manufacturing in India, according to Heavy Industries Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.

Operating on a different model in another part of the cost spectrum is Vietnamese EV -maker VinFast, which was named one of Time’s 100 most influential companies in 2024.

It is taking orders for two premium SUVs, which will be priced in the range of 1.8 million rupees (S$26,500) to 3.5 million rupees, according to Indian media reports.

VinFast opened its first showroom in the city of Surat, in the western state of Gujarat, on July 27, and its second in the city of Chennai, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, on Aug 2. It has also tied up with local partners to create a charging network and for after-sales service, with plans to launch 35 dealerships by the year end in 27 cities.

According to VinFast’s press release, its car assembly plant in Tamil Nadu is the company’s third operational facility globally. The facility, which is part of a 160 billion rupee investment pact

inked between VinFast and the Tamil Nadu government in 2024

, will initially make 50,000 vehicles per year.

VinFast Asia chief executive Pham Sanh Chau told NDTV news channel: “This plant lays a solid foundation for us to make Tamil Nadu not just a manufacturing hub for India, but also VinFast’s largest export base for South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.”

Mr Puneet Gupta, director for India and Asean markets at S&P Global Mobility, said: “Tesla and VinFast will both serve as catalysts in driving up EV market share in India. They are expected to attract greater attention from consumers towards electric vehicles and help increase confidence in EV technology.”

Chinese automobile start-up Leapmotor’s electric cars are also being launched in India, by multinational automotive manufacturing corporation Stellantis, which will assemble the vehicles.

India is hoping that such assembly plants, which are at the lower end of manufacturing, will be the starting point for building a manufacturing ecosystem of EVs.

While domestic EV manufacturers are keen to protect their turf, the government is encouraging foreign carmakers to come to India and make it their EV manufacturing hub in the region.

Consumers with higher purchasing power are turning to EVs

Sales of electric cars are inching up in India, the world’s fourth-largest economy.

In 2024, 99,165 electric cars were sold, which is a 20 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations. EV growth in India has been led by two- and three-wheelers that accounted for a majority of the over two million EVs sold in 2024.

The growth is not coming from the entry-level segment, but SUVs – where cars start at around one million rupees – and the premium segment.

Consumers with more purchasing power, who own more than one car and are aware of environmental concerns, are likely leading the trend, said analysts.

When Mr Surinder Gera decided to replace his 11-year-old diesel car with an electric SUV, he spent as much time convincing his 21-year-old son, with whom he runs the family clothing manufacturing business, as he did researching cars and the charging infrastructure. The family already owns a petrol car.

“He told me it’s too much of a risk, as we travel a lot for our business. But I convinced him. I wanted to bring down my family’s carbon footprint,” said the 47-year-old businessman , who is based in the northern Indian city of Ludhiana.

In addition, Mr Gera charted every location he had visited in the last five years to see whether charging stations were present along each route.

He settled on an SUV made by domestic automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra, which fell within his budget. Mahindra’s electric car line-up starts at around 1.5 million rupees.

Vocal for local

Unlike in other parts of the world, where Chinese EV companies have been rapidly increasing their market share, domestic manufacturers dominate the market in India.

China’s BYD’s, the world’s biggest EV-maker, had a US$1 billion investment plan rejected in 2023 amid geopolitical tensions between India and China.

So BYD scaled down its plans for India and relies on its assembly plant in the southern city of Chennai, which has an annual capacity of 10,000 to 15,000 units. BYD also imports many of the cars it sells in India.

Things may improve for Chinese companies as China and India seek to repair ties following a

2020 clash on their border

.

Tata leads with over half of the market share in the electric car segment, followed by MG Motor, which is a joint venture between India’s JSW Group and China’s Saic Motor. They are followed by Mahindra & Mahindra and China’s BYD.

Tata Motors, which once had a 70 per cent share, is finding its dominance in the Indian market challenged as more competitors come in with new car models and offer innovations like allowing buyers to lease EV batteries.

In response, Tata Motors plans to have around 15 models by 2030. Mahindra & Mahindra in 2024 also announced plans to introduce seven new EVs by 2030.

Long and winding road for foreign car brands

Newcomers face a squeeze between the competition and aspirational buyers who want multiple features at a low price, said EY’s Mr Mulgund.

“India is a very heterogeneous market. There is the rural and urban divide. Building up a dealership and service is no mean feat, and finding the right partners takes time. It can be built, but it’s a longer gestation period,” he said.

“The (EV) market is not massive. Price becomes a critical part of any proposition. Indian customers are also ambitious. They want a car at the right price point but want all the bells and whistles. That is a difficult proposition to beat. You need a certain level of scale to deliver that.”

Government push

In order to push foreign carmakers to manufacture in India, the government in 2025 launched the Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India.

Under the scheme, Customs duty is cut to 15 per cent, provided that automakers invest a minimum of 41.5 billion rupees within three years. They can then import 8,000 electric cars with a cost, insurance and freight value of US$35,000 subject to the 15 per cent tax per car.

So far, Tesla has not shown interest, while other car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Skoda-Volkswagen, Hyundai and Kia have indicated interest, according to Mr Kumaraswamy, the minister.

Volvo Car India’s managing director Jyoti Malhotra told news agency Press Trust of India that, given the level of investment required, the company would do best to continue to assemble its cars in India, as it is doing, for now.

As more benefits are seen, and we anticipate bigger scale, then we can evaluate others, he said.

For India, going electric is an environmental imperative, given how pollution levels are climbing in its urban centres.

According to the World Air Quality Report 2024 by Swiss air-quality technology company IQAir, Delhi is the most polluted capital city in the world and India is the world’s fifth-most polluted country, down from No. 3 in 2023.

Vehicular emissions contributed 51.5 per cent to Delhi’s pollution. Delhi has banned 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol cars, and on July 1, banned even the refuelling of such cars.

Ms Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment, said: “For India, electrification is not just an opportunity to clean up the environment, but it is also an industrial opportunity.”

She noted that the government, apart from implementing manufacturing schemes needed to strengthen charging infrastructure, also needed to incentivise consumers more, citing measures like free parking for EVs.

“In India, you require industry to develop its manufacturing capacity adequately. You need a supply chain of critical minerals and battery manufacturing. But the supply chain will evolve only if the (automobile) industry perceives there is a demand in the market. Both have to go hand in hand.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/380f77964cc64b371357a73bdca95a01987d7dacbf29eba9366abbd8cfd31071,N,,2025-08-10 13:06:32.809034

The Green Infrastructure Grant Opportunities (GIGO) program has been made possible by the bipartisan Rebuild Illinois capital plan. The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is posted at: https://il.amplifund.com/Public/Opportunities/Details/936ac400-7c97-4c3e-8bbb-2e0c9ee711ca.

“Under Rebuild Illinois, the Green Infrastructure Grant Opportunities program has already infused $20 million into Illinois communities, improving water quality with each new project,” said Illinois EPA acting director Jennings in a press release. “Green infrastructure projects not only control stormwater runoff impacting our rivers, lakes and streams, but also improve the local landscape.”

Illinois EPA is seeking proposals for projects to construct green infrastructure best management practices (BMPs) that prevent, eliminate or reduce stormwater runoff, and reduce localized or riverine flooding in Illinois’ rivers, streams and lakes. Projects that implement treatment trains (multiple BMPs in series) and/or multiple BMPs within the same watershed are encouraged as they may be more effective and efficient than a single large green infrastructure BMP. BMPs may be located on public or private land.

Under the GIGO Program, green infrastructure is defined as any stormwater management technique or practice employed with the primary goal to preserve, restore, mimic or enhance natural hydrology. Green infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, methods of using soil and vegetation to promote soil percolation, evapotranspiration and filtering or the harvesting and reuse of precipitation. Examples of project types/BMPs that may be funded through GIGO can be found at https://epa.illinois.gov/topics/grants-loans/water-financial-assistance/gigo.html.

Illinois EPA has set a maximum grant award of $2.5 million and a minimum grant award of $75,000. Applications for the GIGO Program are due by Nov. 5, at 1:00 PM (CST). Additional information is available on the Illinois EPA website. Applicants must apply for GIGO through the GATA Grantee Portal.",https://muddyrivernews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/08/Illinois-EPA.png,N,,2025-08-10 12:06:03.118439

Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.
“With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.
“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read.
The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Several congressional Democrats Friday slammed the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying the move was illegal and would raise families’ energy prices if allowed to proceed.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.

The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed July 4.

Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.

“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

The move sparked a backlash from Democrats in Congress and the states, who said that rescinding the already-obligated funding violated the law.

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program,” the five Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation wrote in a Friday letter to Zeldin and White House Budget Director Russell Vought.

“Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.”

Letters to 60 states, organizations

The 60 recipients of the grant awards, mostly state governments but also tribes and some multistate projects, received letters from the EPA on Thursday informing them the grants were being cancelled.

The letter sent to Oregon’s Department of Energy said the reconciliation bill Trump signed on July 4 rescinded the authorization and appropriations for the fund.

“Any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,” the letter said.

“The EPA has been weighing options for the future of the Solar for All program and has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 grant recipients.”

The letter said the EPA realized that recipients “may have begun to rely” on the program for preliminary budgeting and staffing decisions. But it said that “due to the early nature of such expenditures, we expect any harms to interests suffered to be remedied and remediable.”

In a statement Friday, the Oregon Department of Energy said it had already spent “significant administrative funds” to launch the program later this year, and hinted a legal challenge may come soon.

“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read. “We are surprised and disappointed to hear the U.S. EPA is moving to rescind these already-obligated funds. ODOE will work with our partners, the Governor’s Office, and Oregon’s Attorney General to consider next steps to ensure these funds continue to serve Oregonians as intended.”

‘A betrayal’

Like the Oregon Democrats, New Jersey Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, the ranking member on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the move was illegal and predicted it would raise energy prices.

“The Trump Administration is stealing from working families in broad daylight,” Pallone said in an early Friday statement. “This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills. Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal – it’s a betrayal by this Administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”

Other Democrats, including Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, also focused on the economic impact.

“President Trump ran on lowering costs and creating jobs,” Hobbs wrote on X. “Gutting Solar for All will do the exact opposite. It makes our air dirtier, our energy bills higher, and our economy weaker. I will continue to fight for the clean and affordable energy future Arizonans want and deserve.”

Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.

The new “OBBA” federal tax bill was supposed to be the death knell for the vehicle electrification movement in the US. Guess again. In a living manifestation of the notorious Streisand effect, Costco has put its 50 million or so members on alert that the clock is ticking on the $7,500 EV tax credit, while Ford and General Motors have spent the past week talking up their plans for electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and more electric vehicles. If they go down, they’re going down swinging.

Electric Vehicles & The Streisand Effect

The Streisand effect popped into the vernacular in the early 2000’s. It’s shorthand for a burst of publicity that explodes in all directions when someone with a high media profile inadvertently draws attention to a thing practically nobody knew or cared about — until they drew attention to it.

That sums up the current state of the vehicle electrification movement here in the US, where federal policymakers have been taking various measures to tamp down the enthusiasm for zero-emission mobility.

Some of those measures have probably sailed under the radar of the general public, such as the attempt to halt the federally funded NEVI public charging program (the what?) and dial down the US Postal Service’s plans for adding more electric delivery trucks to its fleet (they were?).

When the topic turns to taxes, though, everybody’s ears prick up and the media spotlight cranks to 11 on the dial. That’s what happened when Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July. The new tax bill eliminates the $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles after September 30, barely seven weeks from now.

Everybody Is Talking About Electric Vehicles Now

With passage of the OBBA, the pressure is on to keep the EV sales momentum going up to the September 30 deadline. The popular wholesale buying club Costco is among the leading EV stakeholders to spread the word. Though better known for helping households and small-to-medium businesses save money on groceries and other essentials, Costco also offers a Costco Auto service that enables its US members to avail themselves of a “haggle-free” experience at participating car dealers.

The Costco Auto service includes electric vehicles, and GM, for one, is probably happy with the results. Last year, Costco began pitching a $1,000 incentive on the purchase of a 2024 Chevy Equinox EV. Coincidentally or not, the Equinox has been front and center in EV sales growth for General Motors this year.

Costco also reinforced its support for EVs earlier this year with the launch of the new Costco Auto online EV Marketplace. Costco has been adding more EV buyer guides and other features the to EV Marketplace since its launch. Now, with the untimely demise of the EV tax credit looming ahead, last week Costco added new members-only incentives for both GM and Volvo. Costco also emphasizes that their Costco Auto incentives can stack onto manufacturer incentives and the federal tax credit all the way up to September 30, on top of any other incentives available to EV buyers.

Ford & GM Pitch Affordability

The elimination of the tax credit comes at a particularly bad time for Ford and GM. The two automakers initially concentrated on high-end electric SUVs and pickup trucks, aiming to compete in the zero-emission mobility market at industry leader Tesla’s price point while the cost of EV batteries was still running high. Now, just when battery costs have come down and the promise of a more affordable ride is coming into view, federal policymakers have thrown a $7,500 monkey wrench into the works.

Nevertheless, both Ford and GM are sticking to their respective programs. Last year, Ford confirmed that its secret, not-so-secret “skunkworks” EV project was in high gear. By the beginning of this summer, the intention became clear: Stop competing with Tesla and start learning from China’s successful, affordable EV journey.

Last week, Ford announced that a big reveal about its affordable EV plans is forthcoming, complete with a high-profile media event to be held in Kentucky on August 11. Ford enthusiasts and other members of the public can follow along online here at 10:20 AM EST.

Ford is pitching the event as its “Model T Moment,” referring to the secretive project that transformed the entire global auto industry in the early 20th century.

“The Model T was more than a single model or body style — it was a flexible platform. With their capability, reliability and repairability, some early Model Ts were fodder for stunts like driving to the top of Pike’s Peak in the Rocky Mountains, climbing the stairs of a courthouse or competing in a cross-country race from New York to Seattle along the nation’s primitive roads, a contest it won over other higher-powered competitors,” Ford explained on its “Ford From The Road” blog last week.

Ford dropped another hint last week when it officially opened its new Electric Vehicle Development Center in Long Beach, California, repurposing an existing 95-year-old campus. In a blog post on the topic, Ford technical program manager Ann Diep let slip another hint about the August 11 announcement. “I can tell you what’s guiding every decision: simplicity, efficiency, and the desire to spark excitement,” Diep wrote.

The Repairability Factor

So, reading the tea leaves, not too many hints surfaced in last week’s blog post aside from simplicity, efficiency, excitement, flexibility, capability, reliability, repairability, durability, and stunt-worthiness. If one of these sticks out like a sore thumb to you, drop a note in the comment thread. My money is on repairability.

The right-to-repair movement aside, electric vehicles have a head start over conventional cars because service costs are far lower. However, that doesn’t mean repair costs following a collision are any less expensive, so it will be interesting to see if, and how, Ford addresses that issue.

One key angle to consider is damage to the battery. Replacing an EV battery is an expensive proposition. However, four intertwining technologies have emerged to take some of the sting out. One is the falling cost of the battery, and the others are the battery swapping trend, second-life applications, and new battery recycling technologies.

GM Banks On Affordable Electric Vehicles, Too

What do you think, some day in the sparkling green future could a repair shop, or a home DIY enthusiast, pop out an old EV battery and plug in a new one as easily as changing a tire, with a rebate on second-life or recycling value helping to cut down the expense?

Maybe, maybe not. On its part, GM is focusing on the cost of the battery. In a page ripped from the pages of the Chinese EV story, last week GM announced that it would buy low-cost LFP batteries from the top Chinese battery maker CATL for its forthcoming Chevy Bolt over the next two years, while it continues to work on setting up an LFP factory here in the US.

That’s … interesting. As with Ford, GM’s new affordable EVs won’t hit the market until long after the $7,500 tax credit falls into the dustbin of history. On top of the tax credit issue, the tariff wars have thrown the entire US auto industry for a loop. Why not wait just a couple of years for domestic sourcing to come through?

Be that as it may, last week GM also dropped word that its cost-cutting journey also involves a leveling up of its partnership with Hyundai. The two automakers are collaborating on four hybrid and conventional cars for the Latin America market, along with an all-electric commercial van for North America.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ford-electric-vehicles-new-california-campus.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 13:06:37.772415

Thank you, Henry Schwan, for your excellent reporting on the proposed withdrawal by the EPA from caring for our environment!

As stewards of planet Earth, we must speak up now to stop this move by the EPA. Worcester is doing its share with the Green Worcester Plan, with a goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions citywide by 2045.

Sen. Ed Markey is raising awareness on the EPA’s plan to repeal its 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are a threat to public health and human life. This 2009 EPA endangerment finding serves as an underpinning of the federal government’s programs to fight climate change.

The EPA plans to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines; eliminate wind and solar programs in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy; eliminate grants that support state and local air quality improvement as well as grants that reduce diesel emissions; and eliminate environmental justice enforcement along with reductions in civil and criminal enforcement as well as compliance monitoring.

This is an appalling abandonment of the EPA’s long-standing fight to improve our air, water and environment.

We can make our voices heard by leaving a comment about the EPA’s proposed regulations at Regulations.gov.

Thank you, Worcester Telegram and Sen. Ed Markey!

Clinging to fossil-fueled past

Paul Diego Craney’s claim that clean energy mandates “completely fail to achieve their goals” is flatly contradicted by the data (Markey blasts EPA chief, Trump over repeal of climate change finding, July 31).

In 2024 alone, the U.S. added nearly 50 gigawatts of new solar capacity — more than any other source and two-thirds of all new power installations nationwide. Solar electricity generation grew by 27% last year. In April 2025, solar supplied over 10% of U.S. electricity, which no serious energy analyst would call a “failure.”

Far from being “ideological,” the momentum behind solar and wind reflects technological progress, market demand and broad public support for cleaner, more resilient infrastructure. Craney’s view clings to a fossil-fueled past while ignoring the reality on the ground: renewable energy is growing faster, employing more Americans and increasingly powering the grid.

The endangerment finding was based on settled science and upheld by courts. Its repeal won’t unleash innovation — it will delay it. And it will cost us more in health, climate and economic disruption.

Massachusetts has been a leader in clean energy not because it’s “feel-good” policy, but because it’s smart policy. Mr. Craney may prefer ideological rigidity. The rest of us prefer clean air, lower bills and a livable future.

Enrollment down, school budget up

In response to the article titled ""Where did all the kids go? Most districts in Worcester County see declines in enrollment.""

I have been a parent with at least one child as a student in the Wachusett Regional School District for the past 13 years.

The WRSD claims of declining enrollment numbers over the past decade are staggering: They have seen almost an 800-student decline in enrollment over the last decade (with 2024 enrollment at 6,630 students, that puts the loss of enrollment number at well over 10%).

However, the WRSD annual budget during that same period has increased by nearly 50%, from $81.3 million in 2015-16 to $121.9 million in 2024-25.

As a taxpayer contributing to the Wachusett Regional School District budget, I urge other taxpayers in the WRSD to start looking closely at how your tax dollars are spent in the school district and ask the question, ""How does an over 10% decrease in student enrollment equate to an over 50% increase in budgetary need during the same period?""

Kudos to Markey in EPA fight

Kudos to Sen. Ed Markey for taking on the absurd and scientifically ignorant EPA chief Lee Zeldin on the Trump lackey’s recent move to repeal the endangerment finding. The senator is entirely correct in denouncing these bureaucratic maneuverings as institutionalized corruption at an astonishingly high level.

Zeldin’s claims of cost reductions for automobile buyers are about as persuasive as the offer of a massive cash advance on a high-interest credit card. While sticker prices for cars and trucks may well drop, the externalities and collateral costs will rise astronomically, and the only people who’ll benefit financially from ending the endangerment finding are the unscrupulous billionaires whose interests are represented by the vacuously named Fiscal Alliance Foundation.

At a time when climate change is no longer a prediction but a phenomenon with real-life consequences, the EPA’s abandonment of its mission is a betrayal of the thousands of scientists and public servants who’ve dedicated their careers to improving the lives of ordinary Americans. We should call this what it is: a giveaway to the fossil fuel industry.

These heat waves put a strain on the power grid as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioning units, and everyday functions like refrigeration require more energy.
exclaimed Andrew McAllister, commissioner of the California Energy Commission, in a statement.
""Performance was consistent across the event, without major fluctuations or any attrition,"" said Ryan Hledik of the Brattle Group, which conducted an analysis of the VPP test, per Electrek.","In the largest test of its kind ever performed in California and potentially the world, energy from 100,000 home batteries across the state was used to supplement the power grid during a time of peak energy use, according to PG&E, a Northern California utility company.

""At exactly 7:00pm, a massive experiment began,"" PG&E said on its website. ""Across the state, thousands of Tesla Powerwalls and Sunrun home batteries kicked into action.""

""These weren't just helping individual homes–they were working together as one giant, invisible power plant.""

Put differently, instead of ramping up electricity production at large, centralized power plants to meet a temporary peak in demand, PG&E instead supplemented the power grid by drawing off the energy stored in roughly 100,000 home batteries.

""For two hours, this 'virtual power plant' (VPP) delivered 535 megawatts of electricity to the grid,"" PG&E explained. ""That's enough to power hundreds of thousands of homes during peak demand.""

The experiment, which was performed July 29 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., was intended to test the performance of the VPP prior to anticipated California heat waves in August and September.

These heat waves put a strain on the power grid as homes and businesses crank up their air conditioning units, and everyday functions like refrigeration require more energy.

In order to ensure that there will always be enough electricity for everyone, electrical grids must be designed with enough capacity to meet the system's peak demand. Adding extra capacity traditionally has meant building more large, centralized power plants.

Building new power plants can be very expensive and, depending on the kind of plant built, it also can be bad for public health and the environment. Plus, it means that much of the system's capacity goes unused at non-peak times.

By creating a VPP from thousands of home batteries, utility operators have hoped to meet peak demand without having to build additional power plants. The statewide VPP experiment was an effort to examine the feasibility of this model.

The test was a resounding success.

""VPPs deliver for the grid!"" exclaimed Andrew McAllister, commissioner of the California Energy Commission, in a statement. ""The test embodies California's innovation economy by applying digital tools to access and aggregate untapped electric resources - supporting grid reliability and helping manage electricity costs.""

Third-party analysts agreed.

""Performance was consistent across the event, without major fluctuations or any attrition,"" said Ryan Hledik of the Brattle Group, which conducted an analysis of the VPP test, per Electrek. Hledik said the test showed ""dependable, planning-grade performance at scale.""

In addition to knowing that they are contributing to their neighbors' energy needs, owners of home battery systems often receive a financial incentive to participate in the program. For example, Sunrun offers customers $150 per battery per season to be a part of the VPP, according to Electrek.

""We're all connected to the same grid, and small contributions from many individuals add up to hugely important, shared benefits,"" said McAllister, the CEC commissioner. ""Even bigger, better things to come!""

Pairing a home battery system with solar panels makes your home more resilient in the event of a power outage, while also lowering your energy bill to practically zero.

The company Magic Valley Energy had sought a permit to build more than 200 wind turbines that would generate an expected 1,000 megawatts.
President Donald Trump temporarily halted the project through an executive order in January, the Idaho Capital Sun reported.
“Idahoans have spoken loud and clear over the last few years: the Lava Ridge Wind Project has no place in our state,” Simpson said Wednesday in an emailed statement.
“Today’s decision confirms that common sense and the will of the people prevailed.” Crapo also celebrated the decision.","The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday that the Lava Ridge Wind Project is officially canceled.

Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said he would reverse approval of the large wind farm project that had been approved to be built outside of Twin Falls on land managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.

The company Magic Valley Energy had sought a permit to build more than 200 wind turbines that would generate an expected 1,000 megawatts.

Burgum said in a press release Wednesday that his office reviewed the decision approving the project and “discovered crucial legal deficiencies in the issuance of the approval.”

The project, which began permitting in 2019, drew deep criticism from Idaho Republican officials, including Governor Brad Little, U.S. Rep Mike Simpson and U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo. President Donald Trump temporarily halted the project through an executive order in January, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. His order directed the federal agency to review the project.

“Idahoans have spoken loud and clear over the last few years: the Lava Ridge Wind Project has no place in our state,” Simpson said Wednesday in an emailed statement. “Today’s decision confirms that common sense and the will of the people prevailed.”

Crapo also celebrated the decision.

“This harmful proposal by the previous Administration willfully neglected widespread opposition from the local community,” Crapo said in a statement. “I am glad to see President Donald Trump fulfilling his commitment to making sure Idaho voices on this matter were heard and respected.”

Little in January also issued an executive order in tandem with the presidents’ to direct state agencies to cooperate with the review of the project and encourage the public to share their concerns about it with the federal agency.

Environmental groups encourage other renewable energy projects

When the president first halted the project, the environmental group Idaho Conservation League argued that other renewable energy projects should be considered, especially in Idaho where much of the state’s energy is imported from elsewhere.

Citicore, which is one of the Philippines' largest solar energy producers, is expecting a ninefold increase in production capacity by the end of next year, company CEO Oliver Tan told Reuters.

The company has planned a 1-gigawatt increase in capacity by the end of 2025 and a further 1.17 GW in 2026, bringing its capacity to 2.56 GW.

Even at its current limited capacity, Citicore is the second-largest provider of solar energy in the Philippines, but its push is part of a larger shift in the nation's energy consumption.

The Philippines long relied heavily on coal to provide its power; in 2023, it passed Indonesia as the most coal-dependent nation in all of South Asia, according to Reuters.

Coal is a massive source of both air and water pollution when burned for fuel; it pumps carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to our warming planet, as well as particulates that can cause respiratory issues and cancer, according to Environment America.

The ash created from burning it poses a serious threat to waterways, and the process of mining it devastates the ecosystems around it.

The country's green energy capacity jumped by 10 percent in 2024, according to government data reported by Reuters. That 9.2 GW of power was more green energy than had been added in the previous three years combined.

Citicore isn't done yet, though. The additions this year are part of a larger plan to add a full 5 GW of solar energy to the Philippine grid by 2030, as the country looks to increase the percentage of its energy that comes from solar power from 3.5 percent to 5.6 percent by 2030.

General Motors Co. will import batteries from China for the upcoming electric Chevrolet Bolt as it works to get a U.S. plant up and running.

GM will buy lithium-iron-phosphate batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the Wall Street Journal first reported Thursday and a source close to the matter confirmed to The Detroit News on Friday.

Ford Motor Co. also has an agreement to license technology from the Chinese battery giant for a multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan, a deal that has faced some political backlash.

“For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,” according to a GM statement. “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model. We’re proud that we sell 12 EVs in the U.S. using domestically-produced battery cells, and in 2027 we will bring LFP production to the U.S, further cementing our unique and resilient US-based supply chain.”

The deal highlights the difficulties U.S. manufacturers face to onshore production in response to President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

GM last month unveiled a plan to produce lithium-iron-phosphate batteries in Tennessee in partnership with LG Energy Solution. But production of those EV batteries, which are cheaper to make because of higher iron content, is not expected to begin until 2027.

In the meantime, GM is willing to pay import taxes in exchange for more affordable batteries to go in the redesigned Bolt, a cult favorite discontinued in 2023. The new Bolt is scheduled to begin production late this year at GM’s Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas.

GM introduced its Bolt to the market in late 2016 and began selling the larger Bolt EUV in 2021. In 2021, the automaker had to recall all Bolts for battery fire risk as the result of manufacturing defects.

Analysts say a key to EV adoption in the United States is affordability, as most EVs are priced at several thousand dollars more than gas-powered counterparts.

It's an investment that proponents say could help change the way America powers its vehicles, homes, and cities.

At 4.7 million square feet — roughly the size of 225 football fields — the $4 billion plant promises to boost clean energy and, in doing so, help cities cut costs and reduce pollution that harms human health.

Mass-producing batteries domestically helps simplify supply chains and potentially lower EV prices, which can also save money for consumers and businesses.

Battery storage also enables more efficient use of renewables like solar. Paired with home panels, the systems can reduce reliance on fossil fuels and cut utility bills. Visit TCD's solar panel guide for installation guidance.

The plant is Panasonic's second in the U.S. It built another within Tesla's Gigafactory campus in Nevada.

The factory is also the largest economic development project in the history of Kansas. Developers say it will bring 4,000 manufacturing jobs and 8,000 extra roles further down its supply chain, Inside EVs reported.

Not only that, but the news outlet reported that it ""comes at a critical moment for EVs in the U.S.""

Global EV demand has softened, and Tesla has seen a slowdown in sales in 2025, with second-quarter deliveries falling 13%. However, the Kansas plant is a strategic hedge. Panasonic said it plans to diversify its customer base beyond Tesla, already supplying Lucid and Mazda.

The Gifford Fire, about 125 miles (201 kilometers) northwest of Los Angeles, had burned 113,648 acres and was 21% contained through Saturday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, commonly known as Cal Fire. So far, 809 people have been evacuated and the Los Padres National Forest was closed because of the flames. There are 3,935 fire crews and support staff on the scene, and at least seven have been injured, according to a joint statement by Cal Fire, the US Forest Service and several local agencies.

The Gifford blaze is the largest of 14 fires across the state, according to Cal Fire.

Large wildfires in Colorado have also caused air quality to drop there, the US National Weather Service said. Alerts are out across western portions of the state, including Vail, the agency said.

Meanwhile, smoke from forest fires in Canada has once again crossed into the US causing air quality alerts to be posted in Minnesota and parts of Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said. There’s also a dense smoke advisory in place across northeast parts of Montana. Across the border, air quality warnings are also in place for parts of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Environment and Climate Change Canada said.

Across Canada, 714 active fires are burning with 166 raging out of control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. So far this year, 4,277 blazes have charred 7.3 million acres. In the US, there have been 42,854 fires reported on 3.5 million acres, the US National Interagency Fire Center said. While the number of US fires exceeds last year’s 32,727 by this date, the acreage burned is less than the more than 5 million acres consumed a year ago.

US heat advisories and extreme heat warnings are posted across parts of the west, including California, Nevada, Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Phoenix is forecast to reach 108F (42C) Sunday, a dip from the record temperatures that gripped the fifth most-populous US city last week.

Phoenix set a new August high temperature of 118F on Thursday.

In New York City and elsewhere in the Northeast, temperatures are set to rise. As many as 12 records may be tied or broken across the region in the coming week, the US Weather Prediction Center said.

Flood watches have been posted across the Midwest, including Milwaukee, the weather service said. The Milwaukee River in Estabrook Park has risen more than 8 feet in the last day cresting at a new record of 11.19 feet, the weather service said.

The US National Hurricane Center is watching two potential storms both in the central Atlantic far from land.

The first is a disorganized patch of thunderstorms that’s moving north into the Atlantic with a 20% chance of becoming a storm in the next week. The second is a broad area of low pressure that is moving off Africa with a 70% chance of becoming a tropical storm or hurricane in the coming week.

The remnants of Tropical Storm Dexter, which has crossed the Atlantic Ocean toward Europe, will set the stage for warmer temperatures to filter in across the UK and Ireland, the UK Met Office said.

So much so that some people around the world are already saying goodbye to wind power after this technological innovation.
Worldwide: According to HTF Market Intelligence, the global offshore solar energy market is expected to grow from US$85 billion to over US$268 billion by 2029.","In the coming years, it won’t be unusual to look out to sea and see veritable “technology islands” floating on the horizon, as is the case now. However, it’s worth noting that these aren’t oil platforms, but rather something much cleaner, quieter, and more ambitious: gigantic solar power plants floating offshore. This is because, instead of occupying agricultural land or urban rooftops, a new generation of energy is emerging directly from the water, literally. This is a bold engineering feat that could transform the seas into strategic allies in the race for clean energy.

Will floating solar conquer the seas or sink under the pressure of the waves?

To better understand this, imagine a floating solar platform the size of 14 football fields. Now, think about it operating offshore, facing waves of up to 8 meters, constant winds, and intense salinity, all without losing efficiency. According to Saipem to Offshore Energy:

“XolarSurf represents a new frontier in floating solar energy, and can be installed anywhere coastal or offshore, even in harsh environmental conditions. It offers an ideal solution for hybrid projects, such as offshore wind farms, both fixed and floating.”

This technology stands out for several reasons, including: it eliminates the need to occupy valuable land; it leverages existing offshore structures, such as wind turbines; it can be scaled up massively, reducing production costs; and the design allows the panels to be moved, reused, or expanded according to energy demand.

Norway just wrote the rulebook: will floating solar now outshine offshore wind?

And which country made all this possible? We’re talking about Norway, which has just released the first official “instruction manual” for installing floating solar power plants offshore. This guide was produced by DNV, a global leader in technical certification, based on a project by the Norwegian company Moss Maritime. This document is even more than a technical tutorial. It serves as a security seal, validating that the technology can be installed reliably, even in the rough waters of the North Sea. It covers the following points:

Safe mooring strategies

Resistance to waves, winds, and currents

Reduction in installation failures

Sharing infrastructure with floating wind turbines

“Compared to wind turbines, solar systems are simpler, cheaper to build, and easier to scale,” says Alexander Minge Thøgersen, VP of Moss Maritime. So much so that some people around the world are already saying goodbye to wind power after this technological innovation. Now, considering who will benefit most, we can even say the entire world, but we separate two main groups:

Aquaculture and isolated communities: Offshore fish farms, for example, require constant power, but are far from the coast and traditional infrastructure. XolarSurf provides clean energy to remote locations, with consumption ranging from 4 to 715 MWh per year.

Worldwide: According to HTF Market Intelligence, the global offshore solar energy market is expected to grow from US$85 billion to over US$268 billion by 2029.

The sun sets on land-based solar: Is the ocean our next power grid?

We need to keep in mind that what Norway has done isn’t just launching a new technology. It’s actually paving a reliable path for the entire world to follow. The creation of the DNV technical manual means other countries now have a safe model to replicate. Furthermore, by utilizing existing structures (such as wind turbine power export cables), deployment costs drop dramatically.

This makes the model viable even for developing countries. The next energy revolution won’t just happen on rooftops or deserts, but also on the high seas. And perhaps the next time you look at the ocean, you’ll see not just waves, but the future shining in the sunlight. That’s why it’s worth mentioning this other eye-catching invention: floating hybrid solar panels.

The U.S. EPA announced Thursday the termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Cincinnati Director of Environment and Sustainability Oliver Kroner says the city planned to use the grant to build a community solar array on a former landfill.

""[It] would provide solar power to 1,300 low-income households in Cincinnati,"" Kroner told WVXU. ""And as part of the grant, we were committed to achieving 20% reduction in energy bills.""

Kroner says the city is evaluating whether the project can move forward with other sources of funding.

""There were a variety of funding sources that the federal government made available between grants and tax credits,"" Kroner said. ""We're watching most of that be eliminated this calendar year. So that changes the financial modeling that we're looking at.""

Cincinnati is a sub-recipient of a Solar for All award to the Industrial Heartland Solar Coalition. Four other Ohio cities are sub-recipients: Akron, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton. Each city would have utilized the funding in different ways to promote solar energy and energy savings for low-income households.

A joint statement from all five mayors urges federal officials to preserve Solar for All.

""Electricity bills and broader cost of living expenses are rising, and the Trump Administration is cutting a program that would save participating Ohio households, on average, nearly $400 per year on their utility bills,"" the statement says. ""Terminating Solar for All funding, including grants already awarded, is harmful. It strips away critical planned resources for home energy upgrades, including rooftop solar, to address energy affordability in our communities.""

Separately, Solar for All awarded the state of Ohio a grant of $156,120,000; although specific plans had not yet been announced, the money would have been administered through the Ohio Air Quality Development Authority and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

NPR reports there may be legal challenges over the cancellation of Solar for All grants, since the money has already been obligated.

Although many use these two terms interchangeably, clean energy and green energy are not synonyms.","If you're interested in socially responsible investing, have you thought about investing in renewable energy sources? With a rise in investment opportunities, green energy is becoming one of the most attractive areas for investors.

This global shift happened due to a number of reasons, from climate change challenges to the financial aspect of energy production.

All of this makes investing in green energy not only environmentally responsible but also a lucrative financial opportunity for long-term wealth.

If you're not familiar with the renewable energy industry, this article aims to explore renewable sources, the best ways to invest in them, and whether you need a financial advisor or not.

Short Summary

Renewable energy derives from natural sources that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed.

Renewable energy sources include sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat as an alternative solution for fossil fuels.

Current best investment opportunities are renewable energy stocks and mutual funds, green energy ETFs, energy storage, etc.

Energy Transition from Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels were once the backbone of global energy but are now losing their dominance. Investors are increasingly recognizing the risks associated with coal, oil, and gas, and many are reallocating capital into green energy.

Investing in fossil fuels implies high risks, such as stranded assets, market volatility, and divestment trends.

On the other hand, this global shift towards the green energy sector comes with numerous benefits. Higher returns on renewable energy, government incentives, and public and corporate pressure are the most obvious ones.

Investing in fossil fuels is not profitable in the long run because of the strict regulations and competition. Investing in renewable energy, on the other hand, is on the rise due to increasing demand and tech improvements.

When investing both short- and long-term, considering factors like government support and market stability is essential.

That is why so many investors are now moving their assets toward the clean energy sector. After all, it's a smart financial move to invest in something that is the way of the future.

Climate Change

Although investors don't make their decisions based on sustainability, it's a key factor in this energy transition. Climate change has become a powerful force in shaping global financial markets, pushing investors toward clean energy solutions.

As extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and policy changes intensify, investment in renewable energy is more than just an ethical choice.

Stricter climate policies that favor green energy investments while discouraging fossil fuel dependency. Carbon taxes, emission regulations, net-zero commitments, and green incentives are making investment in traditional sources a risky choice.

That is why climate-conscious investors are shifting capital toward more sustainable resources. Two of the most popular choices at the moment are ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) funds and green bonds.

Keep in mind that pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers prioritize climate-friendly investments. When it comes to green bonds, many governments and corporations issue green bonds to fund renewable projects. This makes these two types of investments very interesting to a range of investors.

Energy Security

Energy security refers to the availability of a reliable and affordable energy supply. As the world shifts away from fossil fuels, clean energy investments play a crucial role in ensuring long-term energy stability.

On the other hand, investing in solar, wind, and hydropower ensures locally produced, stable energy sources.

By using local, naturally replenished sources like the sun and wind, renewable energy reduces risks like trade restrictions, sanctions, and conflicts.

Governments and corporations are accelerating investments in renewables to reduce energy dependence and enhance national security. They are moving away from fossil fuels towards clean energy. This energy transition has been noticeable for several years now, and it's expected to continue in the future.

Electric Vehicles as the Key Driver of Energy Transition

The electric vehicle revolution is undoubtedly crucial for the green energy transition. As governments push for net-zero emissions and consumers demand cleaner transportation, the EV industry is becoming one of the most attractive investment opportunities in green energy.

Governments worldwide are setting EV adoption targets and banning gas-powered cars. That also implies a higher need for clean electricity and charging infrastructure.

This makes this area of renewable energy great for investments and essential for the overall transition towards clean energy. If you're interested in investing in the EV market, you should take a look at companies such as Tesla, BYD, Rivian, and Lucid Motors.

These three manufacturers are leaders in the market, ensuring growth and stability for investments. They owe their successes to exquisite renewable technologies focused on offering positive answers to climate change.

Before investing, make sure you learn to differentiate natural gas vehicles (NGV) from EVs. Only electric vehicles offer zero tailpipe emissions, while natural gas companies provide lower fuel costs and established refueling infrastructure.

Renewable Energy in Manufacturing Facilities

Manufacturing is a critical part of the renewable energy investment ecosystem. From solar panels and wind turbines to EV batteries and hydrogen fuel cells, clean energy manufacturing facilities are scaling up to meet the increasing demand for renewable technologies.

Investing in companies that build or operate solar panel factories, battery plants, and wind turbine facilities is a smart investment move. In fact, numerous countries are onshoring green energy production to reduce reliance on imports.

As renewable energy adoption accelerates, the demand for solar panels, wind turbines, EVs, and battery storage will skyrocket.

Investing in companies building and operating manufacturing facilities ensures exposure to the entire green energy supply chain.

Green Energy Mutual Funds

Investing in green energy mutual funds is a great way to gain diversified exposure to the growing renewable energy sector without having to pick individual stocks.

These funds are invested in companies across the world that are involved in offering green solutions and products.

If you decide to invest in mutual funds, you should know they are managed by financial experts who research and select the best-performing assets. This simplifies the work as you don't need to track individual stocks or time the market yourself.

When it comes to leading mutual funds in this industry, these are the best investing opportunities:

Naturally Replenished Resources: Solar, Wind, Geothermal Heat, and Hydroelectric Power

One of the biggest advantages of the clean power sector is that it relies on naturally replenished resources. These resources are the sun, wind, water, and geothermal heat.

They provide a sustainable, long-term investment opportunity, reducing reliance on finite fossil fuels and ensuring energy security for the future.

Unlike oil and gas, which are depleting and volatile, hydro, solar, and wind energy are abundant and continuously replenished. Also, the cost of solar and wind energy has dropped significantly, making them more competitive than fossil fuels.

What's important to highlight is that naturally replenished resources reduce dependence on unstable regions, ensuring a more secure energy future.

For the past decades, oil and gas prices have fluctuated due to political conflicts and supply chain disruptions. By using natural resources, these investments become resilient to geopolitical and market risks.

If you're looking to make good investments in this sector, consider investing in companies that work with:

Solar power (solar panels)

Wind power (wind turbines)

Hydropower

Geothermal energy

The Future of Renewable Energy Investment

Green energy investment is becoming one of the most promising and profitable opportunities for the future. Driven by climate policies, technological advancements, and increasing demand for clean energy, the green energy sector is expected to see exponential growth in the coming decade.

Governments across the world are offering tax incentives, grants, and subsidies for renewable energy projects. Even major corporations like Amazon, Google, and Tesla are investing heavily in renewable energy projects and sustainable technology.

The cost of solar panels and wind turbines has dropped significantly, making them cheaper than fossil fuels in many regions.

All of this is skyrocketing the popularity of clean electricity, electric vehicles, and sustainable infrastructure. Consumers and businesses seek eco-friendly solutions, and businesses are transforming their way of doing business to respond to that demand.

It is estimated that this market will reach $2 trillion by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. This makes it one of the fastest-growing investment sectors. Whether through stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, or direct investments, now is definitely the best time to capitalize on the renewable energy boom.

That said, it will still take a while until we see the entire world transitioning completely to renewable sources. Such a transition requires infrastructure and high initial costs, making this process long. Although any eco-friendly business is projected to be a leader in its industry, not all businesses have the resources to move to greener solutions overnight. All of this will impact investors all around the world, marking a trend for everyone with an investment portfolio.

Conclusion

The shift toward alternative energy is no longer just a trend—it’s a defining move toward a more sustainable and resilient global economy. As traditional energy sources lose ground, renewables offer both environmental and financial benefits. With growing support from governments and corporations, investing in green energy is a smart, future-focused decision that combines long-term growth with real-world impact. Now is the time to take part in shaping the future of energy.

The real-estate mogul turned authoritarian president has long railed against green energy — with a notorious enmity toward windmills, which he bizarrely blames for whale mania and for ruining the offshore vibes of his Scottish golf course.

But Trump also governs like a reactionary when it comes to electricity generated by the sun, renewable power that has exploded in popularity — particularly in red America. Of the top 10 states with the most solar installed last quarter, eight were states Trump won, ranging from Texas to Idaho to Pennsylvania.

Why does Trump hate solar?

The impulse appears to be driven in equal parts by a desire to trash Joe Biden’s legacy, in particular the Inflation Reduction Act, which spurred record green investment. Trump is also transparently seeking to boost the profits of fossil fuel producers, including from methane, oil and coal. (Trump really has a kink for coal). The industry backed Trump’s candidacy to the hilt, and the president is now paying them back — with a crusade for dirty-energy “dominance.”

Trump’s war against solar is happening at a moment when server farms and data centers — including those inflating an artificial intelligence bubble — are spiking demand for electricity, spiking inflation in electricity costs.

Trump is also acting to hobble solar energy even as the world reels from the impacts of carbon-boosted warming, like megafires, superstorms, and deadly heatwaves. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is attempting to make climate denial official policy, with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) poised to jettison the “endangerment” finding that has enabled the federal government to regulate greenhouse pollution as a threat to human health.

Below a survey of the steps Trump is taking to cast a shadow over solar energy development:

Revoking Solar Tax Credit for Home Owners

Trump has succeeded, through his mega tax-cut-and-spend legislation known as the Big Beautiful Bill, in dismantling key features of the Inflation Reduction Act, which provided Americans with generous incentives to adopt clean power.

Editor’s picks

For homeowners, that included a federal tax credit covering 30 percent of the cost of rooftop home solar installations, typically defraying about $9,000 of the upfront investment. Under Biden’s legislation, that tax credit was funded through 2034. But Trump’s BBB abruptly nixes the credit at the close of this year. (Homeowners looking to take advantage of the credit should act quickly; new systems need to be online before the dawn of 2026.)

Pulling Federal Support From Solar Manufacturers

Biden’s strategy of green energy investment was about more than lowering carbon emissions — it was about reviving America’s industrial base. In 2022, Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to boost the domestic solar production. Adopted during the Cold War, the DPA was intended to ensure that American industry could produce “technology items essential to the national defense.”

Biden’s order put the Department of Energy to work backing domestic solar manufacturers. Jennifer Granholm, then the Energy Secretary, touted that the investment would “increase national security, promote energy independence, help to address the urgent threat of climate change, and drive down energy costs for American consumers.”

But this March, Trump revoked that authority — with his own executive order, blasting Biden’s use of the DPA as a “Green New Scam” while decrying his predecessor’s “mandates for… solar panels.”

Blocking Solar Development on Federal Land

Trump plucked his Interior Secretary from the governor’s mansion of the petrostate of North Dakota. And Doug Bugum has continued to boost the drill-baby-drill contingent with land-use restrictions that only fossil fuel lobbyists could love.

On August 1, Burgum unveiled new guidelines to block solar (as well as wind) development on federal lands, on the basis of a measurement of “capacity density” — or how many megawatts of energy is delivered by each acre developed.

Solar and wind projects are, by nature of the technology, distributed; they require a significant amount of surface area to produce meaningful amounts of power. The Trump administration is suddenly acting as though federal land is in scarce supply and must be jealously defended against green energy land grabs. (This is the same administration that wanted to sell off five percent of federal land for vacation home and golf course development under the Big Beautiful Bill.)

Burgum’s order clarifies that the Interior Department manages a vast portfolio of land — 245 million acres with an additional 3 billion acres of the continental shelf offshore. But it argues — “based on common sense, arithmetic, and physics” — that because fossil fuel facilities can deliver more energy bang for the acre buck that “wind and solar projects are highly inefficient uses of federal lands.”

Burgum even advances an argument that green energy projects could be illegal, alleging that the “disproportionate land use” of renewable power begs “the question on whether the use of federal lands for any wind and solar projects is consistent with the law.”

Unveiling the order, Burgum claimed that “gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. energy dominance,” insisting they also create a heavy burden for “the American taxpayer and environment.”

‘Pulling the Rug’ on a GOP Deal

The Burgum ban on solar development came in the wake of a Trump executive order titled: “ENDING MARKET DISTORTING SUBSIDIES FOR UNRELIABLE, FOREIGN CONTROLLED ENERGY SOURCES.”

In that order, Trump called for an immediate halt of all federal tax support for clean energy projects. “For too long, the federal government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” the order states. It calls on the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits… for wind and solar facilities.”

Not unlike the subsidies for homeowners, these are generous tax credits for utility scale green energy projects. The Trump rush order is being interpreted as an attempt to scuttle an important concession secured by Republicans in the Senate to slow the phase-out of tax credits under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.

The deal secured a one-year grace period for projects already in the pipeline to begin construction and still qualify for the incentives. One of the negotiators, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), told the Anchorage Daily News that Trump’s order “just pulls the rug out from underneath the deal,” calling it “a total affront to what we had negotiated.” Murkowski was the key vote needed to pass the Big Beautiful Bill.

The dealmakers are not taking the kick in the teeth lightly. Two GOP senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa and John Curtis of Utah, have placed holds on Trump nominations for key Treasury roles in an effort to get the White House to stand down and honor his law.

Taxing Panel Imports

Trump’s war on solar is not new. He got his licks in against solar panels in his first term imposing steep tariffs on panels imported from China. (This is one area of policy where the Biden administration ultimately aligned with Trump, imposing even higher tariffs to help boost domestic solar manufacturers.)

Such protectionism — many environmentalists and economists argue — is self-defeating. First, the dire risks from global warming demand proliferation of green power as quickly as possible. Second, the manufacture of solar panels does little for American jobs, while legions of installers and electricians gain employment when panels are cheap. (A new study finds the original Trump trade distortions cost American consumers billions through 2020.)

Trump’s latest economic disruptions, imposing indiscriminate country-based tariffs are already causing new problems for the solar economy, according to the industry’s trade association, which warns of “supply chain shifts and potential project delays or cancellations, particularly in the utility-scale segment.”

Clawing Back Solar for Non-Rich Folks

The Trump administration is reportedly continuing its quest to claw back already-appropriated funds for clean energy programs.

In the quiet expanses of Maine, where pine forests meet rugged coastlines, a new force is quietly reshaping the state’s energy dynamics. The artificial intelligence boom, fueled by sprawling data centers, is driving unprecedented electricity consumption across the U.S., and Maine is feeling the ripple effects. According to a recent report from the Portland Press Herald, while Maine hasn’t yet become a hotspot for these energy-intensive facilities, the national trend is pushing up costs that could soon impact local residents and businesses.

Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration highlights a stark reality: residential electricity prices in Maine jumped 36.3% between May 2024 and May 2025, one of the highest increases nationwide. This surge coincides with a broader uptick in demand from AI operations, as noted in an analysis by Axios, where the national average rose by 6.5%. Experts attribute part of this to the power-hungry nature of data centers, which require constant, massive energy inputs to run servers for AI training and cloud computing.

Maine’s Unique Position

Unlike states like Virginia or Texas, which host clusters of data centers, Maine has largely been spared direct influxes of these facilities. State officials, as reported in the Portland Press Herald, are actively working to mitigate potential impacts, emphasizing renewable energy sources and grid enhancements. However, the interconnected nature of the U.S. power grid means that demand spikes elsewhere can influence regional prices, including in New England.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect growing public concern, with users highlighting how AI-driven data centers are straining supplies and inflating bills. One sentiment echoes warnings about unreliable power in Maine deterring new data center investments, while others point to national cost increases linked to tech giants’ expansions. This aligns with findings from the International Energy Agency, which predicts AI will surge data center electricity demand globally, potentially transforming energy sectors through efficiency gains but also heightening short-term pressures.

Economic Implications for Residents

For Maine’s households, the cost implications are tangible. The state’s already high electricity rates—among the nation’s steepest—are exacerbated by factors like transmission infrastructure investments needed to handle projected loads. A CBS News investigation reveals that utilities are building out capacity for AI demands, with ratepayers often footing the bill through higher tariffs.

Industry insiders note that between 2024 and 2025, data center power usage contributed to an estimated $9 billion in added energy costs nationwide, as detailed in reports from Maine Morning Star. In Maine, this translates to potential monthly bill hikes, prompting calls for policy interventions like separate rate classes for high-usage corporate consumers to shield residential users.

Policy Responses and Future Outlook

Maine’s Public Utilities Commission is exploring strategies to balance growth with affordability, including incentives for renewable integration. As per insights from The Washington Post, similar challenges in states like Ohio underscore the need for proactive measures, such as mandating clean energy for new data centers.

Looking ahead, the tension between AI innovation and energy sustainability will define Maine’s approach. While the state avoids immediate grid overloads, experts warn that without robust planning, costs could climb further. The Daily Caller reports on spiking utility bills amid skyrocketing demand, a trend Maine officials aim to counter through diversified energy sources. Ultimately, as AI evolves, so too must the frameworks ensuring equitable cost distribution.

Innovations and Mitigations

Emerging technologies offer hope. AI itself could optimize energy use in data centers, reducing waste through predictive algorithms, as suggested by the International Energy Agency. In Maine, investments in wind and solar could offset demands, potentially stabilizing prices.

Yet, challenges persist. X posts from energy watchers criticize the lack of reliable power as a barrier to attracting data centers, while others decry the environmental toll. A Fox News piece details how AI facilities in 13 states have driven 20% bill increases, urging regulatory scrutiny. For industry insiders, the key lies in collaborative efforts between tech firms, utilities, and policymakers to harness AI’s potential without burdening consumers.

Broader National Context

Nationally, the story mirrors Maine’s: data centers now consume more power than entire cities, per WebProNews. In hotspots like Louisiana, costs have risen sharply due to new facilities, as covered by Axios New Orleans.

Maine’s sparing from this boom provides a window for strategic positioning. By prioritizing sustainable expansions, the state could emerge as a model for balancing tech growth with energy equity, avoiding the pitfalls seen elsewhere. As 2025 progresses, monitoring these developments will be crucial for stakeholders navigating this high-stakes intersection of innovation and infrastructure.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-a9661f5b-ee37-4109-9b63-5190d636760c.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:49.711550

If you care about climate, you can choose to source more of your electricity from renewable energy. Your utility predicts demand accurately, plans its investments sensibly, and ensures electricity remains affordable. Would you pay a little more?

This vision is not a distant fantasy. In countries across Europe, North America, and increasingly in Asia, smart grids-grids that are digitally managed, automated, and adaptive-are making such reliability a standard feature, not a luxury. In India’s industrial hubs and Vietnam’s growing manufacturing zones, grid stability is no longer seen as an engineering challenge alone, but as a prerequisite for economic competitiveness.

What is a Smart Grid?

A Smart Grid is an electricity network enhanced with digital technology to allow two-way flows of both electricity and information. It continuously monitors its own performance, detects faults, and makes adjustments to ensure power quality and reliability. In practical terms, this means fewer and shorter outages, better voltage and frequency control, and more flexibility to integrate renewable power sources like solar and wind.

In the traditional model, electricity flows in one direction-from power plants to transmission lines, to distribution networks, and finally to consumers. Operators have limited visibility of what is happening at any point in the system, and response to faults often relies on manual checks and phone calls.

Reliability and Power Quality

To appreciate the value of smart grids, we can start with some basics from high school physics. Electrical power systems in Bangladesh are designed to operate at a frequency of 50 hertz (Hz). This means the alternating current reverses direction 50 times per second. Frequency stability is essential because many devices and industrial processes depend on a constant speed of electrical cycles.

Two measures-System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI)-ensure reliability from the consumer’s perspective. SAIFI records how often, on average, a customer experiences a power outage in a year. SAIDI measures the total duration of those outages. Low SAIFI and SAIDI values are the hallmark of a reliable grid.

Voltage control is equally critical. Voltage can be thought of as the pressure in the electrical system, pushing current through wires and into devices. Too high a voltage can damage sensitive equipment; too low a voltage can cause motors to run inefficiently or stall. Voltage fluctuations also accelerate wear and tear on machinery, leading to higher maintenance costs.

The health of an economy’s industrial base is tied to these technical details. Inconsistent power quality slows production, reduces output, and can deter foreign investors who rely on guaranteed uptime.

Technologies that Enable Smart Grids

Smart Grids are built on a foundation of integrated technologies. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is the operational nerve centre, allowing utilities to monitor and control substations, feeders, and other assets in real time. SCADA systems collect and display data from sensors, giving operators the ability to respond quickly to faults.

The Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) adds intelligence to SCADA. It automates network switching, optimises power flows, and integrates outage management. An Outage Management System (OMS) identifies the exact location of a fault and helps dispatch crews more effectively.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is another key piece. Smart meters measure electricity consumption in real time and send this data back to the utility automatically. This enables accurate billing, faster detection of outages, and demand management programmes that encourage consumers to shift usage away from peak times.

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) store surplus electricity during low-demand periods and release it when demand peaks. This smoothens out fluctuations, supports frequency control, and enables greater use of intermittent renewable energy.

Bangladesh’s Progress So Far

Several initiatives are underway, though most remain limited in scope. Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) has begun a smart grid pilot with funding support from the European Union and implementation by AFD, focusing on automation and power quality improvement. Northern Electricity Supply Company (NESCO) is implementing SCADA, OMS, GIS, and a substantial smart meter rollout

In the west, the West Zone Power Distribution Company (WZPDCL) has deployed automation projects, while the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) is rolling out hundreds of thousands of smart meters. These are promising steps, but they are fragmented. Without integration, common data standards, and sector-wide capacity building, these projects cannot deliver the full benefits of a Smart Grid.

Financing and Incentives

Smart Grid deployment demands substantial capital investment. Experience from other countries shows that well-planned projects can recover costs through operational savings and efficiency gains within five to seven years. Yet in Bangladesh, the regulatory framework often undermines incentives for utilities. Efficiency improvements can lead to tariff adjustments that erase any financial gains, discouraging investment in modernisation.

Picture: Bangladesh Energy Curve, retrieved on 8 August 2025

Reforming tariff structures to reward performance, allowing differentiated service levels, and creating market mechanisms for ancillary services-such as frequency control provided by batteries-can attract both domestic and foreign capital. Public-private partnerships could finance elements like EV charging infrastructure and large-scale battery storage.

Lessons from Regional Peers

India has made significant progress in integrating renewable energy into its grid, using wide-area monitoring systems and automated generation control to manage variability. Vietnam has expanded transmission capacity and invested in storage to smoothen out solar generation spikes. Malaysia is upgrading its grid to attract data centre investments, viewing power quality as a cornerstone of its digital economy ambitions.

These examples highlight a critical point: grid modernisation is not just about engineering-it is an economic strategy. Countries that invest in reliable, high-quality electricity supply position themselves to capture the industries of the future.

The Case for Smart Grids: Why is it NOW and not in FUTURE

If you look at the chart below, it illustrates how Bangladesh’s power system draws from a complex mix of fuel and supply sources-domestic gas, imported power via HVDC links, coal, hydro, solar, heavy fuel oil, and cross-border contracts with Tripura and Adani-while managing shortfalls at peak times. Balancing these diverse inputs is a constant operational challenge, with each source carrying different costs, ramping capabilities, and reliability profiles. A smart grid, with advanced forecasting, real-time monitoring, and control can really keep the costs down.

The case for Smart Grids in Bangladesh is also urgent on the distribution side, because of the volume of power the utilities are having to handle. According to utility-wise demand handling of power in IEPMP 2022, Bangladesh has a different hallmark. It is dominated by small consumers, in geographically diverse settings.

The future economy will be driven by sectors that demand uninterrupted, high-quality power: advanced manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence data centres, and high-end services. Regional competitors are already upgrading their grids to meet these requirements. Bangladesh must act quickly to remain competitive.

Major blackouts in 2014 and 2022 demonstrated the vulnerability of the current system. Without fast detection and response capabilities, small faults cascaded into nationwide outages. Every such event imposes a hidden tax on the economy in the form of lost production, damaged equipment, and reduced investor confidence.

The choice is clear: continue with incremental upgrades and risk falling further behind, or commit to a coordinated, sector-wide modernisation that makes reliability and quality the standard, not the exception. The Government should form a separate working council akin to SREDA for promotion of Smart Grids. Institutional reforms must happen at the distribution company level.

Every flicker of a lightbulb, every hum of an overloaded motor, every shutdown of a production line is a signal that Bangladesh’s power infrastructure is not yet ready for the demand of the future. It is smarter to invest openly in a grid that delivers stability than to keep paying the hidden costs of one that does not.

General Matter is privately funded and focused on development of uranium enrichment technology to reshore domestic nuclear fuel capacity and power U.S. energy production.","Uranium enrichment company General Matter plans to establish operations in Paducah, Kentucky. The $1.5 billion project is expected to create 140 jobs.

The investment will include the construction of a commercial uranium enrichment facility, located at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, which will produce fuel needed for the next generation of nuclear energy. Operations are scheduled to begin by 2030.

“Seventy-five years ago, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected Paducah to help lead the nation’s original enrichment efforts,” said General Matter CEO Scott Nolan. “We are proud to return to and reactivate this historic site to power a new era of American energy independence, and we thank our partners in Kentucky and at the DOE’s Office of Environmental Management and the Office of Nuclear Energy for supporting us in this landmark investment in American nuclear infrastructure.”

To support the project the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority preliminarily approved a 15-year incentive agreement with the company under the Kentucky Business Investment program. The performance-based agreement can provide up to $14 million in tax incentives based on the company’s investment of nearly $1.5 billion and annual targets of: creation and maintenance of 140 Kentucky-resident, full-time jobs across 15 years; and paying an average hourly wage of $64, including benefits, across those jobs.

Additionally, KEDFA approved the company for up to $3.5 million in tax incentives through the Kentucky Enterprise Initiative Act (KEIA). KEIA allows approved companies to recoup Kentucky sales and use tax on construction costs, building fixtures, equipment used in research and development and electronic processing.

“I want to congratulate the team at General Matter on this major step toward what will be the largest economic investment ever for Western Kentucky,” Governor Andy Beshear noted. “This lease reflects Kentucky’s leadership in nuclear energy and our strong partnerships at the federal and local levels, as well as in the private sector. I am looking forward to being back in Paducah soon to celebrate the next key milestone for this exciting and historic project.”

By meeting its annual targets over the agreement term, the company can be eligible to keep a portion of the new tax revenue it generates. The company may claim eligible incentives against its income tax liability and/or wage assessments. In addition, General Matter can receive resources from Kentucky’s workforce service providers. Those include no-cost recruitment and job placement services, reduced-cost customized training and job-training incentives.

“We appreciate General Matter’s partnership and their decision to locate in Paducah,” added Greater Paducah Economic Development President and CEO Bruce Wilcox . “Their investment is among the largest our community has seen in more than 75 years, bringing life-changing opportunities to our residents through strong wages and long-term careers. For many families, the DOE site is personal. Parents helped build it, their children work there today, and now the next generation has a chance to carry that legacy forward.”

Bruce Westerman, R-Hot Springs, is ready for Congress to get back in session after its August recess. He knows there will be a challenge passing a federal budget, but he’d like to focus attention on a popular initiative: permitting reform.

Westerman is a co-sponsor and lead sponsor of the SPEED Act, a bipartisan measure, that he hopes will lead to more economic stimulus and less burdensome business regulation.

SPEED stands for “standardizing, permitting and enhancing economic development.” The Fourth District Congressman said the bill needs to pass to correct well-intended, but misguided precedent over the past few decades.

“We’ll not only see growth in the economy, but I believe we’ll see better protections for the environment as well, because the system that we’ve got now is broken. It’s well-intended. It all hinges around something called the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA… but there’s been some high-profile Supreme Court cases regarding NEPA lately.”

Westerman cited some of the recent decisions, particularly one that says federal agencies have been too restrictive through the rulemaking process.

“It takes an average of 4.7 years to go through the NEPA process. You get some projects like mining and offshore energy production that might take decades to get through the NEPA process. What it’s doing is throwing a wet blanket on development and on building things and growing the economy here at home. So I think this is one of the biggest issues that Congress can tackle,” he said. “I think we can potentially get this done by the end of the year.”

Westerman also said he’s hearing from constituents about the impact of tariffs on their businesses. He said he’s been passing concerns to the White House.

“I’ve given them feedback on businesses in my district that are suffering that need some relief. Trade policy gets very complicated,” said Westerman.

He also said that despite uncertainty from tariffs, Westerman believes that President Trump is angling to correct longstanding trade imbalances with other countries.

“It [uncertainty] does affect businesses on a day-to-day basis, and I could go down a list naming businesses in my district that are having issues because of tariffs and trade policies. But, also there’s some excitement around the fact that we’re hopefully going to get to a more level playing field,” he said.

“I think everybody’s ready for all the trade issues to get settled so that businesses can get more certainty in them and that we can start growing the economy and doing the things that I think the economy’s really ready to do. All the indicators are showing that if we just, I think, get the trade policy that our economy’s really going to take off,” he added.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BruceWesterman2025.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:41.052527

Final Thoughts The global nuclear landscape is diverging.","Nuclear power has always been a paradox. It can produce massive amounts of low-carbon electricity, yet it must constantly battle the headwinds of politics and public perception.

The latest Statistical Review of World Energy shows that while nuclear generation is growing globally—setting a new record high in 2024—the trend is anything but uniform. Some countries are charging ahead, while others are stepping back.

Global Output: Modest Growth, Unevenly Shared

In 2024, global nuclear generation reached 2,817 terawatt-hours, a modest uptick from 2023, but surpassing the previous all-time high set in 2021.

Over the past decade, output has grown at a 2.6% annual rate—slow, but a clear recovery from the post-Fukushima slump. That growth is heavily skewed toward non-OECD countries, which are building new capacity at a faster pace (3.0% annual growth) than the flat-to-declining trend in OECD nations (2.5%).

Asia Pacific: The New Center of Gravity

The most dramatic shift is happening in Asia Pacific, now responsible for over 28% of global nuclear output—over double its share from a decade ago:

As with renewables, China is in a league of its own, with output soaring from 213 TWh in 2014 to more than 450 TWh in 2024—an annual growth rate near 13%.

India and South Korea also posted steady gains, though on a smaller scale.

This marks a clear geopolitical shift. Nuclear power is no longer dominated by Western democracies, but by countries with state-driven, long-term infrastructure agendas.

North America: Stable, but Aging

The United States still leads the world in nuclear output at roughly 850 TWh annually (29.2% of the world’s total nuclear output), but beneath the stability is a slow attrition of older plants and a lack of new construction.

But the U.S. had its biggest nuclear milestone in decades in 2023 and 2024 with the startup of Vogtle Unit 3, followed by Unit 4. Located in Georgia, Vogtle is the first newly built nuclear power plant in the United States in more than 30 years, and its completion marks the end of a long, costly construction saga plagued by delays and budget overruns. Together, the two new reactors added more than 2,200 megawatts of capacity—enough to power over a million homes—and provide a rare example of nuclear expansion in a country where most growth has come from extending the lives of existing plants.

Canada’s output has slipped from 106 TWh in 2016 to 85 TWh in 2024, reflecting plant refurbishments and changing policies. Mexico, a small player, has seen big year-to-year swings, which may indicate operational challenges.

Europe: A Story of Contrasts

Western Europe is drifting away from nuclear:

France, long the gold standard for nuclear reliability, has seen output fall from 442 TWh in 2016 to just 338 TWh last year, hampered by maintenance issues and political uncertainty.

Germany is now at zero after completing its nuclear phase-out.

Belgium, Switzerland, and Sweden are split between retirements and life extensions.

In Eastern Europe, the picture is brighter. The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia are increasing output, while Ukraine has managed to maintain over 50 TWh annually despite wartime disruptions.

Emerging Regions: Small Shares, Big Moves

In Latin America, Brazil and Argentina are holding steady around 15–25 TWh, with Brazil inching higher. Africa’s only nuclear producer, South Africa, remains flat at about 13 TWh. The Middle East has a new entrant in the UAE, which ramped from zero in 2019 to over 40 TWh in 2024 thanks to the Barakah plant—an impressive buildout in such a short time.

The Outliers

Japan has restarted some reactors, but its output remains far below pre-Fukushima levels—84 TWh last year versus more than 300 TWh in 2010.

Taiwan is phasing out nuclear, with production falling from 42 TWh in 2016 to just 12 TWh in 2024.

Pakistan and Iran continue steady, if modest, growth.

Final Thoughts

The global nuclear landscape is diverging. Some countries are doubling down, driven by the twin imperatives of energy security and climate action, while others are walking away. The center of gravity is moving away from traditional Western producers toward nations prepared to back nuclear with long-term capital and policy support.

For investors, the next wave of growth is likely to come from Asia and the Middle East, not the historical powerhouses of Europe and North America. That shift carries environmental upside as well—especially in China, the world’s largest carbon emitter. Every gigawatt China moves from coal to nuclear represents a major win in the fight to reduce carbon emissions.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68977e4f44438134ed10692a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-10 11:03:45.178360

SMR is also being suggested as a solution amid lingering doubts about the safety of existing nuclear power plants such as the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan.
As the name ""modular"" indicates, the cost of the project is also significantly lower than that of conventional large-scale nuclear power because each part of a nuclear power plant can be manufactured at the factory.
By connecting multiple SMRs, large-scale facilities can be built, enabling competition with existing nuclear power plants.
SMR is evaluated as 100 to 1000 times safer than ordinary nuclear power plants, said Kim Moo-hwan, a professor of advanced nuclear engineering at POSTECH.","SMR (Small Modular Reactor), which received attention only when Microsoft founder Bill Gates declared that he would start ""Terra Power"" in 2006. His choice as a philanthropist was an ambitious project to solve the Earth's energy problems and climate change problems at once, and the answer was nuclear power.

SMR, which is to supply electricity cheaply and eco-friendly, is drawing more attention at the moment when demand for electricity is rapidly increasing in line with the advent of the artificial intelligence (AI) era. This is because AI data centers called ""electricity-eating hippos"" are built everywhere, increasing demand for energy projects that will supply large-scale power. SMR is also being suggested as a solution amid lingering doubts about the safety of existing nuclear power plants such as the Fukushima nuclear crisis in Japan.

SMR has several advantages compared to traditional nuclear power generation. First of all, in terms of safety, it has strengths over existing nuclear power plants, can be built faster, and because it is a small nuclear power plant, it can be built near a city where it is a consumer. As the name ""modular"" indicates, the cost of the project is also significantly lower than that of conventional large-scale nuclear power because each part of a nuclear power plant can be manufactured at the factory. By connecting multiple SMRs, large-scale facilities can be built, enabling competition with existing nuclear power plants. SMR is evaluated as 100 to 1000 times safer than ordinary nuclear power plants, said Kim Moo-hwan, a professor of advanced nuclear engineering at POSTECH. ""Because it is one-tenth the size of a large nuclear power plant, it has the advantage of being able to put it close to where it is needed."" SMR is currently competing with several types of reactors, including sodium and high-temperature gas, he said. ""It will remain on the market to prove that it works well and is safe within a few years.""

According to Precious Research, a global market research company, the SMR market is expected to grow from $6.88 billion this year to $16.13 billion (8.9% per year on average) by 2034. The World Economic Forum (WEF) expects average annual growth to reach 22% by 2040.

According to this market outlook, SMR competition is entering around the world, but Korea is advantageous over other countries because it has existing nuclear power plant construction capabilities.

Doosan Efficiency is planning a foundry business that precisely analyzes the design of each SMR developer from the perspective of the manufacturer based on its 40 years of experience in supplying key nuclear power plants, including nuclear reactors and steam generators, and mass-produces SMR by applying optimal manufacturing processes and technologies. Just as fabless (design company) and foundry (consignment production) companies are divided in the semiconductor industry, it plans to expand its future market based on SMR cycle manufacturing.

Doosan Efficiency is in the process of producing prototypes for SMR's first product, introducing dedicated manufacturing equipment, and building facilities. With the plan to secure production capabilities of 20 units a year, the goal is to win orders for 62 SMR cycles in the future. Doosan Efficiency can be manufactured from materials for nuclear power plants to precision large equipment, and through this, it can secure stable delivery dates, high quality, and price competitiveness. Doosan Efficiency signed a contract with Newscale Power to review the productivity of nuclear reactor modules in 2019 and has been investing in equity and cooperating with module material production.

HD Hyundai collaborated with Terra Power in the U.S. to develop core SMR facilities. The 4th generation Schodium Cooling High Speed Reactor (SFR), developed by HD Hyundai and Terra Power, is a type of SMR, and the reactor vessel is one of SMR's key facilities that stores the core where the nuclear fission reaction occurs and keeps the coolant in high temperature and low pressure safe. For the successful implementation of this project, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries plans to actively utilize the know-how it has accumulated by participating in the development and production of vacuum containers, the main core facilities of international fusion experiments and Korean fusion research devices. Professor Kim suggested, ""Korea is developing only one type of SMR that uses water as a coolant, but it is necessary to develop several types of SMR.""

If the U.S.-leading design and domestic companies' SMR manufacturing capabilities are combined, South Korea and the U.S. are likely to win-win in the SMR market, just like in the shipbuilding sector.

The industry is arguing that it is necessary to create a strategic fostering area to secure the competitiveness of the SMR industry. It is also necessary to provide intensive support for R&D, demonstration, and production fields through the designation of national industrial complexes or special zones, and to lay the groundwork for early expansion of distribution by enacting related special laws.

SMR-related systems are also urgently needed. Safety and certification regulations specialized for SMR should be prepared, and legal grounds for fostering clusters and regulations related to budget support are still known to be insufficient. For companies that are developing SMR, it is also suggested that if it is designated as a national strategic technology under the Special Tax Act, R&D tax credits will be available, which will help international competitiveness.",https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/10/news-p.v1.20250810.22676be188574ed18ef4ff7b8d95f53e_P1.png,N,,2025-08-10 13:07:20.189126

Reorganizing Agriculture

The Senate on Aug. 1, by a 53-42 vote, rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), to the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 3944), that would have barred funding to reorganize the Agriculture Department (USDA) under a plan released in late July, and require a public review of the plan. Van Hollen said Agriculture should “take a step back and provide a transparent, informed, carefully considered plan for any such reorganization before implementing it.” An amendment opponent, Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), said Congress had “a good process” for review, and “we do not need to overly handcuff the USDA as they work to make this transition, which is a transition that we should make.”

VA Reorganization

The Senate on Aug. 1, by a 50-45 vote, rejected an amendment sponsored by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), to the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 3944), that would have required the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department to provide Congress with a report on its planned workforce cuts. Ossoff cited possible large-scale firings in fiscal 2026 at the VA, and said “if there are going to be significant reductions in force at the VA, we should know how it affects veterans’ benefits.” An amendment opponent, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), said no such firings were planned, and that another amendment regarding VA staffing procedures provided sufficient oversight.

VA, Agriculture and FDA Spending

The Senate on Aug. 1, by an 87-9 vote, passed the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 3944), sponsored by Rep. John Carter (R-Texas), to provide $435 billion to fund the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department, and $18 billion for military construction programs, in fiscal 2026. The bill would also fund the Agriculture Department, and Food and Drug Administration, in fiscal 2026. A supporter, Susan Collins (R-Maine), said the military provisions would address housing and other key infrastructure needs, and help “ensure that veterans receive the care and benefits they have earned through their service to our country.” Collins added that the non-military provisions support “our farmers and rural communities; the safety of our food supply; critical federal nutrition programs like the WIC Program; and medical research and advancements.”

Mullin said it “meets the needs of Congress and supports our agencies, especially the Sergeant at Arms and the Capitol Police, in a very fiscally responsible manner.” An opponent, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), said the amendment’s 6 percent spending increase, higher than the increase for other areas of government, was excessive.

By MARC LEVY, The Associated Press

HARRISBURG — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electric bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the substantial energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

The decision to revive the Duane Arnold Energy Center opens a new chapter in the ongoing narrative of nuclear energy in the United States.","In a significant shift in energy policy, NextEra Energy has announced plans to revive the Duane Arnold Energy Center, a nuclear power plant located in Iowa. The plant, which operated for over four decades, was originally shut down in 2020. This decision marks a departure from the company’s previous plans to replace the nuclear facility with a solar energy project. The move also aligns with a broader national trend to reconsider the viability of nuclear power as a carbon-free energy source, amid growing concerns over climate change and energy reliability.

The History of Duane Arnold Energy Center

The Duane Arnold Energy Center, a 615 MWe boiling water reactor, has a storied history. It was initially shut down in 2020 after 45 years of service, primarily due to economic decisions by its main customer, Alliant Energy. This decision led NextEra to terminate its power purchase agreement five years earlier than planned. However, the plant’s closure was accelerated by an unexpected derecho windstorm in August 2020, which severely damaged the cooling towers.

Despite the shutdown, the facility was never completely dismantled. The reactor was defueled, and the nuclear fuel was securely stored on-site. The plant entered SAFSTOR, a deferred decommissioning status allowing for safe maintenance while residual radioactivity decays. This process has preserved much of the plant’s infrastructure, making a potential restart feasible.

Renewed Interest in Nuclear Energy

The decision to reconsider the Duane Arnold Energy Center is part of a broader trend across the United States to revive shuttered nuclear facilities. As the nation grapples with the challenges of reducing carbon emissions, nuclear energy is being reevaluated for its potential as a stable, carbon-free power source. The recommissioning of Duane Arnold could set a precedent for other plants to follow suit.

NextEra Energy’s request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to restore interconnection rights underscores this shift. The company aims to accelerate the recommissioning process, prioritizing nuclear energy over solar development. This move is part of a larger strategy to ensure energy reliability and meet climate goals, reflecting changing attitudes towards nuclear power.

Challenges and Opportunities

While the potential restart of the Duane Arnold Energy Center presents opportunities, it also poses several challenges. One of the primary hurdles is the comprehensive engineering evaluation that NextEra must conduct before making a final decision. This assessment will determine the feasibility of restoring the plant to operational status by 2028.

Moreover, the financial and regulatory aspects of recommissioning a nuclear plant can be complex. Navigating federal and state regulations, securing funding, and addressing public concerns about nuclear safety will be critical to the project’s success. However, if successful, the restart could provide a significant boost to local economies and contribute to national energy goals.

The Future of Nuclear Energy in the U.S.

The potential revival of the Duane Arnold Energy Center is indicative of a larger trend in the U.S. energy landscape. As other countries also reconsider nuclear energy, the U.S. is poised to play a leading role in this transition. The successful recommissioning of shuttered plants could serve as a model for other states and nations exploring similar paths.

Overall, the move to restart Duane Arnold highlights the complexities and opportunities inherent in transitioning to a carbon-free energy future. As the U.S. continues to evaluate its energy options, the role of nuclear power will likely remain a topic of considerable debate and strategic importance.

The decision to revive the Duane Arnold Energy Center opens a new chapter in the ongoing narrative of nuclear energy in the United States. As energy demands grow and the push for carbon-free solutions intensifies, will nuclear power emerge as a key component of the nation’s energy strategy?

The fix is simple, scalable, and could reshape green energy storage, the journal Science Advances reported.

Researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST; Saudi Arabia) have identified a key molecular issue that has been preventing aqueous rechargeable batteries from becoming a safer and more cost-effective option for storing sustainable energy. Published in Science Advances, their study explains how water inside these batteries can damage performance and shorten lifespan. However, by adding inexpensive salts like zinc sulfate, the researchers were able to dramatically reduce this problem and extend battery life by over ten times.

A major factor that influences how long a battery lasts is the anode, the component where chemical reactions take place to produce and store energy. Unfortunately, certain unwanted chemical reactions, known as parasitic reactions, can damage the anode and shorten the battery’s overall lifespan.

The study reveals that free water molecules play a major role in triggering these harmful reactions. The addition of zinc sulfate helps limit the presence of free water, reducing its ability to degrade the anode.

“Our findings highlight the importance of water structure in battery chemistry, a key parameter that has been previously overlooked,” said KAUST Professor and Chair of the KAUST Center of Excellence for Renewable Energy and Storage Technologies (CREST) Husam Alshareef, the principal investigator leading the study.

Free water describes water molecules that are not strongly bonded to other molecules. This state allows free water to engage with more molecules than otherwise, triggering unwanted reactions that consume energy and compromise the anode.

Sulfate was found to stabilize the bonds of free water, acting as what the KAUST team describes as a “water glue,” to change the dynamics of the water molecules that reduces the number of parasitic reactions.

While the bulk of experiments by the KAUST researchers were done on batteries using zinc sulfate, early investigation has shown that sulfate has the same effect on other metal anodes, suggesting the inclusion of sulfate salts into the battery design could be a universal solution for lengthening the lifespan of all aqueous batteries.

“Sulfate salts are cheap, widely available, and chemically stable, making our solution scientifically and economically viable,” said KAUST Research Scientist Yunpei Zhu, who conducted the bulk of the experiments.

Aqueous batteries are gaining significant global attention as a sustainable solution for large-scale energy storage and are projected to exceed a market size of $10 billion by 2030. Unlike lithium batteries, which are often used in electric vehicles, aqueous batteries offer a safer and more sustainable option for integrating renewable energy sources like solar power into electrical grids.

Many speakers cited recent Environmental Protection Agency decisions they claim have weakened climate protection, including the announced intent to roll back the agency’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.
“If they can’t even admit that climate change is real,” Padilla asked, “then how can they protect us from it?” Reps. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) and Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) underscored the urgency of action.
“This is the human cost of climate change,” Chu said, pointing to displacement, financial insecurity, illness, and deaths.
“No federal government to protect us?” “I don’t think anybody could hear these stories without being moved,” Chu said.","On Saturday, Los Angeles-area elected officials, advocacy groups, and community members convened in Pasadena for what was billed as a “People’s Hearing on Extreme Weather.”

Organized by the Climate Action Campaign and its member environmental activist groups, the event drew testimony from wildfire survivors and health officials. They criticized the Trump administration and are seeking to put pressure on California to safeguard climate change programs.

Many speakers cited recent Environmental Protection Agency decisions they claim have weakened climate protection, including the announced intent to roll back the agency’s 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.

U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, in a prerecorded video, contended that climate change is taking a toll in Los Angeles communities, from poor air quality to the devastation brought by wildfires, which a recent study suggests were more deadly than previously reported. “If they can’t even admit that climate change is real,” Padilla asked, “then how can they protect us from it?”

Reps. Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) and Laura Friedman (D-Glendale) underscored the urgency of action. “This is the human cost of climate change,” Chu said, pointing to displacement, financial insecurity, illness, and deaths. Friedman called the recent EPA actions “part of this administration’s attack on all science.”

The heart of the gathering within Pasadena’s historic Maxwell House was testimony from residents, including survivors of the Eaton and Palisades fires, and community leaders, who sat in front of signs with such slogans as “people over polluters” and “stop EPA’s climate chaos.” The event had political overtones, and many of the two dozen speakers came with prepared speeches.

“These disasters aren’t rare any more. They’re becoming constant,” said Pasadena resident Rosanna Valverde, whose home was damaged in the Eaton fire. “Instead of helping families prepare for what’s clearly already happening, they’re [the current administration] making it worse.”

Fellow Eaton fire survivor Sam Stracich described climate disaster as “not only the abnormally intense and frequent fires … but the long and stressful aftermath,” adding that denying climate change “puts more people’s health, homes and futures at risk.”

Dennis Higgins recounted returning to his home in the Pacific Palisades to find “just rubble.” Referring to the Trump administration’s plan to revisit federal findings from 2009 that declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health, Higgins warned that homes rebuilt in the area would “burn again if we don’t get these protections.”

A student from Palisades High School said she believed policy failures compounded the wildfire’s destruction. “It wasn’t just the fire that destroyed my neighborhood,” said Sophie Smeeton, a rising senior. “It was the systematic denial of risk, the dissolution of safeguards, and the refusal to treat the climate crisis with urgency.”

Chris Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, said air pollution used to be his primary concern.

Demand is projected to outstrip supply in the coming years, largely due to data centers powering artificial intelligence. That leaves the government no choice: To avoid an energy crisis, it needs to supersize the nation’s electrical grid.

The Trump administration, apparently, hasn’t gotten the memo. Instead, it’s allowing its opposition to clean energy sources, such as wind and solar, to stymie growth.

Case in point: The Energy Department’s cancellation last week of a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for a major transmission project in the Midwest. The line, known as the Grain Belt Express, would cross 800 miles of farmland to deliver wind energy generated in Kansas to power more than 3 million homes in the region. This is exactly the sort of development the country needs to strengthen the grid and make use of its natural wind resources.

Yet the administration sided with NIMBYs who have long opposed the project, which has been in the works for more than a decade. The Energy Department explained in its announcement that it was “not critical for the federal government to have a role” in the project. It also claimed that the project is “unlikely” to meet the conditions required for the loan guarantee — without clearly laying out those conditions.

Invenergy, the company behind the project, has said it will pursue private financing. Hopefully that materializes, and ideally such undertakings could happen without any government backing. But the loss of the loan guarantee poses a serious threat to both the transmission line and to the renewable energy projects that would have been built to supply it.

Such paralysis is now typical of the U.S. energy system. Despite ever-increasing demand for electricity, construction of the new transmission lines needed to deliver it has slowed to a glacial pace. That’s because building the infrastructure across multiple jurisdictions is expensive and comes with painful regulatory headaches. And far too often, politics gets in the way, especially when it requires construction on privately owned land.

In 2024, only 322 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines were completed, one of the slowest annual figures in the past 15 years. An Energy Department study last year projected that, to meet the nation’s energy needs most optimally, regional transmission capacity needs to double by 2050 and interregional capacity needs to rise by a factor of 3.5. That would require the nation to build more than 5,000 miles of transmission lines a year, according to Americans for a Clean Energy Grid.

Despite President Donald Trump’s promises to “unleash American energy,” his administration seems to be actively working against that lofty goal. This month, New York’s Public Service Commission halted a new transmission line that would bring the state’s offshore wind power to New York City. Why? Because Trump’s executive order to stop offshore wind developments makes the power lines risky for taxpayers.

Meanwhile, the administration seems to be trying to kill solar and wind projects by a thousand bureaucratic cuts. This month, the Interior Department issued a directive requiring virtually every aspect of such developments on federal lands — or those that pass through it via transmission lines — to receive personal approval from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy. That policy change came shortly after Congress passed its reconciliation package, which restricted access to tax credits for any wind and solar project that does not begin construction by July 4, 2026. A bottleneck seems to be the goal.

The administration justifies its antisolar and wind posture by arguing that other forms of energy, such as fossil fuels and nuclear, are more reliable. It also leans on national security concerns, since China controls much of the supply chain for those industries.

But these points don’t stand up to scrutiny. To start, building up the renewable energy sector would help alleviate climate change in the long term, which itself would make the energy sector more reliable and boost national security.

Moreover, many European countries rely heavily on solar and wind and have not experienced the “intermittency” problems that critics warn about. No energy source is 100-percent reliable, which only underscores the need to diversify the United States’ energy sector and modernize its electrical grid with more transmission lines. That would allow electricity from multiple sources to move around the country as needed.

And while China’s chokehold on the renewable energy supply chain is a genuine problem, it hardly justifies giving up on these industries. China’s investments in solar and wind already put the United States to shame. The answer is not to cede the technological advantage to America’s most powerful adversary. It is to compete so that the U.S. can regain its edge.

The great irony here is that, for years, Republicans decried subsidies for renewable energy as the government “picking winners and losers.” Now, they are embracing the same mindset they once opposed, but in the opposite direction. They are intent on making solar and wind losers; if they succeed, U.S. consumers will lose, too.

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

When the Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to eliminate the Energy Star program became public, pushback from environmental groups was expected. The government-funded labeling system helps consumers identify energy-efficient products and practices, saving them $40 billion annually in energy costs. Since its founding in 1992, Energy Star has helped avoid at least 4 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions and has been lauded as one of the most effective decarbonization tools in U.S. history.

But over the last few months, a broad and unexpected coalition of industry groups has come out in support of the program. They range from the American Chemistry Council and the National Association of Home Builders to the Spray Foam Coalition, American Bakers Association, and the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance. The American Chemistry Council regularly fights the EPA’s regulation of power plants, and the Pool and Hot Tub Alliance’s previous lobbying efforts have promoted natural gas use in homes. Now, they find themselves aligned with environmental groups like the Sierra Club in defending Energy Star.

It’s an “interesting bedfellows” situation, said Justin Koscher, president of the Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association, which represents manufacturers of a type of rigid insulation used mostly in commercial roofing projects. “It’s not too often you get all of those groups saying the exact same thing on one particular issue.”

Most Americans recognize Energy Star from the iconic cyan-and-white logo on appliances like light fixtures, computers, and refrigerators, signaling that a third party has certified that the product uses less energy than other comparable options. But entire homes and buildings can also be certified as energy-efficient, and the Energy Star Portfolio Manager helps building managers track energy use.

Residential and commercial buildings combined make up about a third of the country’s total energy use, and nearly a quarter of all commercial buildings in the country use the tool. Energy Star incentivizes energy-efficient building practices, guides appliance choice, and drives demand for products like insulation. Koscher worries that if Energy Star disappears, so might the incentive.

Energy Star Portfolio Manager is also the basis for how cities and counties across the nation measure whether buildings within their borders are complying with local-level energy-efficiency regulations. Almost 50 municipalities—and a few entire states—rely on the program, according to the Energy Star website. If Energy Star is privatized or eliminated, there’s currently no adequate replacement, said Paula Cino of the National Multifamily Housing Council, a group representing apartment building owners, developers, and managers.

Energy Star certification can be good for landlords’ bottom line. One study found that after an office building earns the label, rents in the building go up even as utility costs—an indicator of how much energy the building is using—remain unchanged. That suggests the program may be boosting the market value of already-efficient buildings without necessarily reducing energy use. Since the program is voluntary, its opt-in nature also appeals to organizations that prefer it over stricter, local electrification mandates. In March, Cino’s group sent a letter to Trump administration officials asking to roll back a lengthy slate of building and appliance efficiency standards. But even so, the group sees value in Energy Star’s tools.

“There is still a tremendous need for building owners to be able to understand how their building is using energy, and that is expressly what Energy Star Portfolio Manager provides for the business community,” Cino said.

Support for Energy Star in Congress is bipartisan. In July, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $36 million in funding for the program. The House Appropriations Committee also passed a bill that sets Energy Star’s funding floor for the upcoming year at $32 million. Both are a far cry from the White House’s stated interest in zeroing out funding for Energy Star altogether. But final approval of funding appropriations for the EPA is still months away.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2043303030-2.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-10 07:59:09.932699

As the country industrialized at a breakneck pace, coal plants became the backbone of its energy system — reliable, abundant, and deeply tied to economic development. Even as the world turned its focus to emissions and climate policy, the country continued to lean heavily on its domestic coal supply, seeing it as a tool for stability and energy security around the world. At the same time, China hasn’t ignored the clean energy race. In fact, it’s been leading it.

China is active in multiple sectors

The country has outpaced global rivals in wind, solar, and battery investments, setting new installation records year after year. Policymakers have promoted green infrastructure, rolled out decarbonization targets, and boosted electric transport. On paper, the energy transition is well underway — and even ahead of schedule in some areas.

But progress on one front doesn’t always mean retreat on another. And as global attention focuses on China’s clean energy surge, a different trend has quietly picked up speed beneath the surface — one that’s raising tough questions about the country’s true way forward and the changes in the project once it appeared to be ready.

New coal-fired power capacity

In 2024, China started building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity and resumed work on another 3.3GW of previously paused projects — the highest level of construction seen in the past decade, according to two think tanks. This surge, largely backed by investments from the coal mining industry, brings up big questions about the ability to move away from fossil fuels, the report warns.

While the country massive additions in clean energy are expected to gradually cut coal’s share of electricity generation, especially as the country pushes toward its goals of peaking carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, the rapid growth in coal power presents a clear challenge to those commitments.

The study reports that construction began on 94.5GW of new coal plants in 2024, showing that coal projects continue despite government pledges to limit fossil fuel use. Another 3.3GW of previously paused projects also restarted. Approvals for new coal plants came up in the second half of 2024, reaching 66.7GW, after only 9GW were approved in the first half.

Driven by industry

The report also points out that after a steady decline from 84.3GW in 2015 to 32.1GW in 2021, new and resumed coal projects have been increasing since 2022. From 2022 on, new coal project proposals surged — reaching 146GW in 2022 and 117GW in 2023. On the other hand, proposals dropped to 68.9GW in 2024.

More than 75% of newly approved coal plants are backed by coal mining companies or energy groups involved in coal mining, the study finds. This may be partly due to China’s carbon goals pushing those companies to diversify, seeking steady demand for coal through 2030 and beyond.

Looking forward to 2025

The coal industry forecasts continued growth, which the report says will heighten the conflict between China’s energy security needs and its low-carbon ambitions. To shift the balance, strong policy action will be needed in 2025. That could mean making clear targets to cut coal use, phasing out coal plants, reducing coal plant operation rates, and boosting renewable energy.

Other steps might include stopping approvals for new coal plants and speeding up the retirement of old ones. The report also points to reforms in how power providers are incentivized — such as limiting long-term coal supply contracts and promoting electricity market reforms.

In July, Türkiye witnessed a 2.1 percent increase in electricity production compared to the same month last year, driven by a rise in the contributions of natural gas and solar energy, which compensated for the declining outputs from hydroelectric and wind power plants.

According to data compiled from the Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEİAŞ), electricity production remained stable while consumption rose by 1.4 percent. Production reached 34.85 million megawatt-hours, while consumption totaled 34.59 million megawatt-hours.

The increase in consumption was primarily attributed to higher cooling needs and air conditioning usage due to hot weather conditions.

The production figures for July showed that natural gas generated 8.69 million megawatt-hours, making it the leading source, followed by imported coal at 7.3 million megawatt-hours. Hydroelectric plants produced 5.67 million megawatt-hours, solar energy contributed 4.1 million megawatt-hours and wind power generated 3.56 million megawatt-hours.

The tax breaks, which apply to new, used and leased EVs, are being eliminated under legislation signed by President Donald Trump in July. The original Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act had extended these incentives through 2032.

The $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs helps bridge the price gap between electric and gasoline vehicles. CNBC reported that the average transaction price for new EVs in the US was $55,689 before incentives, compared to $48,078 for traditional vehicles.

Among the information available through the map are projected agriculture losses, cancer levels, and information about where wastewater discharges occur. The map also can layer environmental risk factors with Iowa demographics, like low-income areas, unemployment and health factors, like asthma.

One of the environmental threats incorporated in the map is wildfire risk. The map displays the share or properties in an area that are at risk of fire over the next 30 years. It assigns a percentile, which is that area’s risk relative to other areas. A higher percentile means that area is more likely than others to experience a wildfire.

Cody Smith, senior policy advocate at the Council, created the map using federal data downloaded from government websites. Smith said much of the data has since been removed from government websites, following President Donald Trump taking office in January.

Of all the environmental risks — or “indicators” — included on the map, Smith said Iowa’s wildfire risk jumped out to him the most.

“It was really surprising to me,” Smith said. “Because I just don’t think a lot about fire risk in Iowa.”

Several areas of the state had higher percentiles for fire risk than he anticipated, Smith said.

For example, a small portion of Woodbury County in western Iowa had a wildfire risk in the 92nd percentile.

According to Wildfire Risk to Communities, an organization that measures wildfire risk across the country using data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Forest Service, areas that score in the 91st percentile or above for wildfires are considered to have “very high” risk.

For areas like Woodbury County, this means that only 8 percent of areas across the country have a higher risk of wildfire.

In Tama County, areas around the towns of Tama and Toledo are in the 85th and 87th percentiles for wildfire risk. Belle Plaine in Benton County is at the 89th percentile.

And an area in Scott County, just north of Davenport, has a fire risk in the 74th percentile.

A percentile between the 70 and 90 is considered “high.”

“Nationally, these line up with places in California and Colorado and even Tennessee and North Carolina,” Smith said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency defines a wildfire as an unplanned fire burning in natural or wildland areas such as forests, shrub lands, grasslands, or prairies.

FEMA, which is housed under the Department of Homeland Security, runs the National Risk Index, which rates the risk of wildfire for different communities across the country.

Iowa Ideas In-Depth Week Explores Extreme Weather in Iowa

Iowa Ideas, a project of The Gazette, is hosting a free, virtual In-Depth Week series called Extreme Weather in Iowa, Aug. 11-15.

The week features five sessions, held 12-1 p.m. each day. Full session descriptions, including a list of panelists, and registration can be found at iowaideas.com. Here is the week’s schedule:

• Monday: How has Iowa’s weather changed? As Iowa grapples with changing weather patterns and their impacts, what are the facts when it comes to floods, derechos, microbursts and other extreme weather in the last decade?

• Tuesday: Health impacts of extreme weather: Whether it’s the air quality from Canadian wildfires, humidity, or seasonal allergies, this session will explore the health impacts Iowans face with Iowa’s changing climate.

• Wednesday: Economic threats of extreme weather: Iowans have suffered more than their fair share of natural disasters, and the losses that come with them. How is Iowa’s changing weather impacting the state’s economy?

• Thursday: Hardening of agriculture to withstand weather extremes: Iowa’s agriculture industry is among the most adept at pivoting. What are the benefits and trade-offs of the latest refinement efforts?

• Friday: Designing for the future of increased extreme weather: With the increase of severe weather events in Iowa, lessons have been learned. How is design of infrastructure and housing changing as a result?

Driving the fire risk

David Flory is a teaching professor in the Earth, Atmosphere and Climate Department at Iowa State University.

When it comes wildfire risk, he said drought conditions typically come with it.

“When there are dry conditions and low soil moistures, plants dry out and you have increased fire risk,” Flory said. “You could talk about winds in terms of increased fire risk, but I really think it's the drought conditions that are the biggest player.”

Iowa experienced its longest drought in more than 60 years between 2020 and 2024. The worst of the drought was recorded Dec. 19, 2023, when 35 percent of the state was classified as being in “extreme drought.”

The drought broke in May 2024, but dry conditions crept back in last summer and fall.

Today, the state has no drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor — only dry pockets. In fact, July was Iowa’s second-wettest July on record (only 1993 saw more rain), with more than double the average monthly rainfall.

Flory said Eastern Iowa tends to see more precipitation, on average, than the western side of the state or Nebraska. As a result, he said western Iowa uses more irrigation practices to water farmland. In 2017, only about 222,000 of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland were irrigated.

But areas like prairies and forested areas are not irrigated. So when drought conditions come in, the plants in those areas stay dry. In those areas, Flory said fire risk can remain high.

Aside from drought and dry conditions, Flory said high winds also can play a role in wildfire risk.

“When you have higher winds and you have ongoing fires, it's really hard to contain them. Embers will float in the winds or get moved around, and that’s really difficult to manage,” Flory said. “Winds are important here, but they do make it difficult to contain fires when they do occur.”

An ‘overlooked’ issue

Jason Walker, fire program leader for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, said the fire risk in Iowa generally is overlooked.

“The existence of the threat is here, and at some point in time, we ultimately could face something catastrophic and want to be prepared,” Walker said. “We work on those kinds of things annually and try to prepare the best we can.”

Walker and his team from the DNR are currently in Willow Creek, California, working on fire risk prevention in Six Rivers National Forest.

In California, the Gifford Fire has burned at least 131 square miles of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, with just 9 percent containment, the Associated Press reported. It is the biggest fire in the state so far this year.

Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, with almost 4,000 fires recorded already this calendar year, NPR reported. The smoke from the fires — many of which are considered “out of control” — drifted south earlier this month, prompting air quality warnings across the Midwest.

Walker said he believes fire threats are overlooked in Iowa because it is predominately an agricultural state.

“That being said, we see some pretty crazy fires every year in our standing cornfields when they're cured in the fall,” Walker said.

Over the last several decades, Walker said environmental agencies and organizations have worked to analyze theoretical wildfire risks across the U.S.

Walker pointed to the work that Northeast-Midwest State Foresters Alliance does with analyzing wildfire risks, especially through its Northeast-Midwest Wildfire Risk Explorer interactive map.

The map looks at fire risk across the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.

The map measures each state’s fire risk based on the potential damage to structures due to wildfires.

According to the map, most of Iowa has a low to moderate fire risk. However, similar to the Iowa Environmental Council’s map, some areas show fire risks that are considered “very high.”

The locations labeled “very high” appear across the entire state, but higher risk areas are clustered on the western side of the state.

Walker said there are multiple factors that go into fire risk assessments, but western Iowa generally is at a greater risk than other parts of the state because more of the land is used for agriculture.

“There's a high percentage of Iowa that most of the year is just literally unburnable. It's either green corn or black dirt,” Walker said. “But when you get into areas like the western part of the state — and the Loess Hills area specifically — you (have) larger tracts of land with burnable fuels.”

Preventing wildfires

With wildfires, Walker said his team at the DNR tries to “preach prevention” when talking with property owners about how to prevent fires and protect their homes.

A lot of prevention comes down to creating a “defensible space.” He said making a defensible space can be as simple as cutting down tall grasses in some fields or near buildings to reduce the amount of fuel fires can pick up as they move.

For homeowners, Walker said this could mean making sure a wooden deck is stained or protected against fire, so that it won’t catch fire or help the fire spread.

“If you have tall grass or highly flammable fuels right up to your house, by the time that fire gets to your house, the firefighters really have no chance at stopping that or slowing that fire down before it consumes your house,” he said. “That's what you see in a lot of instances, like in Los Angeles.”

He said most wildfires that occur in Iowa are grass fires off the edge of an interstate.

“Small flames don't get big news like you do out west and that's really the awareness,” Walker said. “I think people become complacent and don't think about it.”

'Spoke to Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and shared with him the Indian perspective on our energy security, including increasing energy trade with the United States,' Kwatra said in a post on X.

https://x.com/AmbVMKwatra/status/1954206497157616000

The conversation comes after US Senator Lindsey Graham on Friday (local time) urged India to use its influence with Russia to help end the war in Ukraine, calling it one of the most significant steps to improve India-US relations.

'As I have been telling my friends in India, one of the most consequential things they could do to improve India-U.S. relations is to help President Trump end this bloodbath in Ukraine,' Graham posted on X.

'India is the second largest purchaser of Putin's cheap oil, the proceeds of which fuel his war machine. I hope Prime Minister Modi emphasised to Putin in their recent phone call the need to end this war in Ukraine justly, honourably and forever. I have always believed India has influence in this matter and I am hoping they will use it wisely,' he wrote.

His comments came on the same day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced he had a 'very good and detailed' conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

'Had a very good and detailed conversation with my friend, President Putin. I thanked him for sharing the latest developments on Ukraine,' PM Modi said in a post on X. 'We also reviewed the progress in our bilateral agenda, and reaffirmed our commitment to further deepen the India-Russia Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership. I look forward to hosting President Putin in India later this year.'

However, the meeting with Senator Graham also comes amid escalating trade tensions, after US President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on imports from India earlier this week in response to New Delhi's continued purchase of Russian oil. The new tariff, set to take effect after 21 days, will raise the total duty on Indian goods to 50 per cent. Trump cited national security and foreign policy concerns, claiming that India's imports of Russian oil pose an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' to the United States.

According to the White House order, the levy will apply to all Indian goods imported into the US, except for items already in transit or those qualifying for specific exemptions.

In a strong domestic message, Prime Minister Modi addressed the US tariff decision directly on Thursday, reaffirming his government's commitment to protecting the agricultural sector.

'For us, the interest of our farmers is our top priority. India will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers. I know we will have to pay a heavy price for it, and I am ready for it. India is ready for it,' PM Modi said. (ANI)

The funding, part of the Biden-era's Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency's ""endangerment finding"" which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American ""energy dominance in the global market.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

""The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. ""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin's action was illegal.

""Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ""At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn't just wrong -- it's absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.""

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

""These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

""This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,"" she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, ""we will see them in court.""

Grant recipients have already challenged the administration's actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin's elimination of the solar program a betrayal ""that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.""

""Trump is -- yet again -- putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,"" he added.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/08/10/210780806_210780806-8b27cb95e8d5437187dc9a1c61edde53_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-08-10 07:59:14.696315

You named the 2022 climate bill as a major achievement.
The good news is, in state after state after state, we continue to make progress.
We have to continue to play the best damn defense, but we can continue to be on offense in state after state after state.","When Gene Karpinski took over as the president of the League of Conservation Voters nearly two decades ago, 20 percent of the candidates the environmental lobbying and political powerhouse endorsed for federal office were Republicans.

Last year, none were.

After almost 50 years as a top progressive advocate in Washington, Mr. Karpinski, 73, retired in the spring from his position leading the L.C.V., which is known for its voting scorecard that rates lawmakers on environmental policy. It was also once known for its record of bipartisanship in backing both Republicans and Democrats for office, a relative rarity for Washington interest groups.

But the polarization of Washington and the growing divide between the parties on climate issues has made bipartisanship much more difficult to embrace. President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s climate law was enacted three years ago over the uniform opposition of Republicans, who repealed large swaths of it in the recent domestic policy legislation President Trump signed into law.

In a recent interview, Mr. Karpinski, a well-known figure on Capitol Hill who started in Washington in 1977 as one of Ralph Nader’s “raiders” and headed the Public Interest Research Group for 21 years, reflected on the shifting politics of environmental policy.

This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

What do you see as your biggest achievement at the L.C.V.?

On the institutional side, we built it from a staff of about 30 to a staff of over 200, from a budget of $12 million to a budget of over $200 million and a state L.C.V. network that has also grown significantly. Just as importantly in the long run, we won some significant victories, including the biggest climate bill that the world has ever seen, which, as you know, passed in August of 2022 after a failed effort back in 2009 and 2010.

Learned a lot of lessons. So built the institution into a much more significant force, and won some important policies. Along the way, helped win a lot of elections and became the biggest player in the progressive community to help win elections, to elect climate champions and defeat climate enemies.

One of the interesting things about your group was that you were bipartisan — you endorsed candidates from both parties. Did that stay true through the end of your tenure?

When I first started, I would say about 20 percent of our endorsements at the federal level were Republicans. You needed to work both sides of the aisle to get things done. But that has shifted in the last bit of time, as the Republican Party, frankly, has become captured by the special interests, particularly the oil, gas and coal industries, and did their bidding.

The environment was historically a bipartisan issue. You remember in 1990, the Clean Air Act passed with over 400 votes in the House, 88 votes in the Senate. George [H.W.] Bush, the president, proudly signed it. That bill would not pass today, because the Republican Party leadership would not let that happen.

So has it become impossible for an environmental group such as the L.C.V. to get behind Republicans?

Not impossible, but much, much, much more difficult. I think it remains easier at the state level. We have a network of 33 state LCVs across the country. They do the same kind of work we do — do elections and win policies. Because the fossil fuel industry is not as powerful in some of these states, they can find more bipartisan support there. In Washington, it’s not impossible, but it’s not easy. [Representative] Brian Fitzpatrick is a shining example, someone from a swing district in Pennsylvania who has the highest Republican score. I think he’s probably got about a 70 lifetime score [out of 100]. There used to be a lot more Brian Fitzpatricks.

I remember when congressional Republicans were among the leaders of the environmental movement.

When I started in 2006, the guy I recruited to be my vice chair was a guy named Sherry Boehlert [former Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York]. When he retired in 2006, he chaired the House Science Committee as a Republican and held hearings on climate change, and talked about the problems with climate change. We had a whole slew of folks we would meet with all the time: [then-Representatives] Chris Shays, Wayne Gilchrist, Connie Morella, Mark Kirk and many, many more. We would meet in their offices and strategize with Republicans who cared about the environment. Right now the list is far too short.

You named the 2022 climate bill as a major achievement. Do you worry it will all come undone?

[Mr. Trump’s domestic policy legislation] was a horrible bill that will significantly hamper the ability to go forward at the federal level. The good news is, in state after state after state, we continue to make progress. In 2017, after Trump became president, we weren’t going to make any progress at the federal level on climate, so we went back to the states, elected a lot of new governors, a lot of state legislators. Literally less than 1 percent of the public lived in a state with a policy that said we need 100 percent clean energy back in 2017. Now over 40 percent of the country lives in a state with 100 percent clean-energy policy, and the programs will continue in most states.

The progress at the federal level has been severely impacted by the ugly bill and what the [Environmental Protection Agency and Department Of Energy] are doing as well. And the latest E.P.A. proposal coming out very soon — to declare climate change pollution does not impact public health — is appallingly dishonest, and would be deadly for generations to come. We have to continue to play the best damn defense, but we can continue to be on offense in state after state after state.

One of the subjects that emerged in the debate over the so-called big, beautiful bill was a new push to sell public lands for revenue. One of the main priorities of the L.C.V. is to keep public land public. Does it concern you that there’s a new discussion to unload federal property in the West?

It’s absolutely concerning. The good news on that is even most Republicans in the West said that goes too far, because people in the West appreciate, respect and enjoy those public lands, and they bring a lot of resources to the state, which is great. That was a rare example in the moment we’re in where there was bipartisan opposition to that crazy proposal, and therefore it failed.

In recent years, how much did the L.C.V. typically invest in political campaigns?

2024 was our biggest ever. Go back to when I started, it was a little less than $5 million. If you add in the state and federal in 2024, we invested over $160 million in mostly national, but also state elections as well.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/11/multimedia/11dc-karpinski-top1-zpcf/11dc-karpinski-top1-zpcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 07:59:17.847851

To Mansour, this sight is a testament to China's rapid transformation of cutting-edge technology into accessible vehicles that are reshaping Egypt's automotive landscape.

""A growing number of Egyptian consumers are choosing Chinese cars over their German, Japanese, and other counterparts,"" he told Xinhua, crediting their appeal to a trifecta of strengths: advanced tech, near-premium features, and competitive pricing.

The welding factory, part of a 123-million-U.S. dollar venture between China's Jetour and Egypt's major automotive dealer Kasrawy Group, is expected to assemble and produce Jetour T1 and T2 models next year, with the goal of both local market supply and export.

Mostafa Hussein, vice president of Kasrawy's automotive division for Jetour vehicles, outlined the company's ambitious expansion plans: An existing 55,000-square-meter factory producing Jetour X70 Plus will soon be complemented by an 86,000-square-meter plant slated for 2025 completion.

It’s a production pickup, a workhorse, driven on public roads by General Motors engineers who turned a casual “what if” into a mind-blowing reality.

Forty GM engineers hatched the idea in late 2024, when they wondered just how far the Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck, with its 493-mile EPA estimated range, could go if they pushed every efficiency button possible. Guesses flew around the room—800 miles, maybe 900, or for the bold, 1,000. The challenge was set: take a stock truck, make only minor adjustments allowed by the owner’s manual and see how far it could go on its 205-kWh battery.

The team chose public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground in southeastern Michigan, finishing in Detroit’s Belle Isle. To accommodate the test, engineers took one-hour driving shifts, each bringing their expertise to the wheel. They traveled at a constant speed of 20 to 25 miles per hour, which they discovered increased efficiency by channeling nearly all battery power to propulsion.

Tires were inflated to their highest recommended pressure to reduce rolling resistance. The spare tire was left behind to shave weight. Wheel alignment was calculated for optimal performance and windshield wiper arms were lowered to cut drag. Climate control was turned off entirely, while hard braking and quick acceleration were avoided to maintain an energy-saving pace.

Driving 20 to 25 miles per hour for 1,059.2 miles isn’t practical for most, but the engineers’ slow, steady pace revealed a truth: this truck’s battery and design can go farther than anyone thought, even under conditions most drivers would never duplicate.

Each mile fed data back to GM’s engineers, giving them insights into battery chemistry, drive unit efficiency and vehicle dynamics. Kurt Kelty, GM’s vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, said it was all about teamwork. It required deep integration across software, engineering and driving strategy to get every last mile out of the charge.

When the odometer hit 1,059.2 miles the team didn’t just break the Lucid Air’s 749-mile record they smashed it by 310 miles. This wasn’t an official Guinness World Record, GM treated it as an internal challenge, a proof of concept for their electric vehicle technology. To celebrate they recharged the Silverado EV and used its battery to power a 3D printer and made a trophy for the team’s achievement – a fitting nod to their ingenuity.

Silver linings for First Solar Even though Donald Trump’s new bill curtails many of Joe Biden’s incentives for solar power, there are several silver linings for First Solar.","The US has been undergoing a quiet energy revolution. The amount of energy produced by solar, wind and geothermal sources has more than tripled over the last decade. Solar energy has been one of the big winners.

Total installed capacity has grown eightfold, while solar power’s share of new energy capacity has expanded almost continuously from a minuscule 4% in 2010 to 66% in 2024, a figure that rises to 84% when you include storage. While Trump’s return to the White House has cast doubt on the subsector’s progress, even he may not be able to stop its rise. That is good news for firms like First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR).

For most of its history, First Solar has focused on making and installing solar panels; it is still the seventh-largest manufacturer of photovoltaic (solar) power cells in the world. However, in the past few years, it has shifted its emphasis from panels for retail customers to utilities and now makes much of its money from building and maintaining solar power plants.

This shift has proved a shrewd move, as power companies have been eager to invest in solar energy in order to secure a range of tax credits and mandates from both the US government and individual states, notably the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Silver linings for First Solar

Even though Donald Trump’s new bill curtails many of Joe Biden’s incentives for solar power, there are several silver linings for First Solar. Firstly, the tax credits for utilities will last longer than those for residential panels, while Trump’s changes won’t affect state-level mandates.

Most importantly, Trump’s tariff policies mean that the solar panels sold by Chinese rivals, who currently dominate the market, accounting for seven out of ten of the world’s largest producers, are now much more expensive. While the tariffs have also increased the price of many components that First Solar imports, the net impact of the tariffs is so positive for First Solar that even when you take the subsidy cuts into account, the group is in a better position than it was before Trump arrived in office, according to management.

First Solar has made excellent progress over the past few years, with sales rising from $3.06 billion in 2019 to $4.21 billion five years later – an increase of 40%. Sales are expected to grow even faster in future, increasing by around 50% in the next two years. Normalised earnings per share have jumped more than tenfold between 2019 and 2024, while operating margins have swelled, and the company now boasts a double-digit return on capital employed. Despite this, First Solar is still valued at only eight times 2026 earnings.

With First Solar recently upgrading its profit forecasts, the stock has been on a tear, beating the wider market over the last six months. It is also trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. I therefore suggest that you go long at the current price of $184 at £11 per $1. In that case I recommend putting the stop-loss at $100, which gives you a total downside risk of £924.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5aJKhumDEyJrFX9Tf78koJ.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 04:59:10.215663

If every gasoline-powered vehicle in the US were replaced by an EV, transmission constraints would prevent the cleanest available electricity from reaching many charging locations. This “grid congestion” would force greater reliance on nearby fossil fuel power plants, undercutting the emissions benefits of electrification.

After identifying the issue, the study also recommends a modest set of targeted transmission grid upgrades to alleviate congestion and unlock the full emissions-reduction potential of EV adoption.

Northwestern’s Adilson Motter, the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Physics at Northwestern’s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences and the director of the Center for Network Dynamics, conducted the research with Chao Duan, a former Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern.

Like a highway system, the power grid is a vast infrastructure that transmits electricity across the US. After being generated at plants, electricity travels long distances through high-voltage transmission lines that span entire states and regions. It then reaches substations, where its voltage is reduced. Power then flows through distribution lines to homes, businesses and EV charging stations.

To analyze electricity’s journey through power lines, the researchers combined data on vehicle usage and power grid infrastructure. Using advanced computer models, the team simulated the flow of electricity across the US under varying levels of vehicle electrification and renewable energy generation. In every scenario with high EV adoption, grid congestion emerged as a critical bottleneck.

As EV adoption increases, so does electricity demand, especially in urban areas. But renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are typically located far from cities, such as on rural wind farms or solar arrays in the desert. While clean energy is available, transmission capacity is often too limited to deliver it where it is needed, including EV charging stations. As a result, the grid draws electricity from closer—but more polluting—power plants that generate electricity by burning coal, oil and gas.

In the study’s most ambitious simulation, scientists converted the entire US vehicle fleet to electric. If the grid had adequate transmission capacity, this shift could eliminate nearly all vehicle-related CO2 emissions once renewable energy matches nonrenewable energy generation. But, with current grid constraints, one-third of those potential emissions savings would be lost.

The charging schedule of EVs can be optimized to align with intermittent renewable generation But even with smart charging, efficient use of clean energy still depends on having enough transmission capacity to deliver it where it’s needed.

—Adilson Motter

To address this bottleneck, the researchers calculated how much additional transmission capacity would be needed. They found that increasing the existing grid’s transmission capacity by as little as 3 to 13% would significantly reduce congestion. This could involve building new high-voltage lines or expanding existing ones—enabling more clean power from remote wind and solar farms to reach the cities and suburbs where EV charging demand is highest.

Motter stresses that the entire grid does not need to be rebuilt. Instead, he recommends targeted upgrades in areas where congestions are most likely to occur. The US grid is divided into three largely independent regions—Eastern, Western and Texas—with limited ability to transfer power among them. Improved connections and coordination among regions would help clean energy reach the areas that need it most.

Power grids began as local networks, where consumption was close to generation. Over time, they evolved into nationwide — even continent-wide — systems. It was a gradual growth process built on existing infrastructure. No one wants to redesign it from scratch, but we do need targeted upgrades that reflect the large-scale reach of today’s grid.

Maintaining a constant speed offers the same energy savings with an EV as it does with gas-powered vehicles.","General Motors Co. engineers unofficially broke industry records for miles driven in an electric vehicle on a single charge, the Detroit automaker said Tuesday, going more than 1,000 miles.

Drivers reached more than double the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimated 493-mile range for the 2026 Silverado EV Work Truck, which Chief Engineer Joe Roy said is GM’s longest-range offering.

The test comes as U.S. adoption of EVs grows much slower than GM and other automakers anticipated, accounting for more than 7% of the market this year. Analysts predict interest will temporarily drop once the $7,500 tax credits for EV buyers end in September and the Trump administration works to roll back emissions regulations that incentivized production despite lagging consumer demand.

Roy said increasing EV range remains a top priority to sway skeptics worried about frequent charging.

“Range is the No. 1 pain point from a customer perspective,” Roy said.

Volunteers drove the Silverado in roughly hour-long shifts, 12 hours a day over the course of seven days to test the extended-range battery’s limits.

Officially, the Lucid Air Grand Touring holds the Guinness World Record for most miles driven on a single charge. A team of three drivers officially earned the title July 5 after driving more than 748 miles from Silvaplana, Switzerland, to Munich, Germany, over the course of two days.

The Silverado’s journey was less intense. Engineers plotted routes for maximum efficiency around metro Detroit. Like the Lucid team, drivers took advantage of optimal warm weather during the summer for the best battery performance.

To maintain battery life as long as possible, drivers also turned off the truck’s air conditioning, despite several 90-degree days. No riders were permitted during most of the test, and the team ditched the vehicle’s spare tire to reduce weight. Testing stopped before nightfall, which avoided using battery power to run headlights. And drivers kept speeds at 20-25 miles per hour as often as possible.

“We’re definitely taking this to the extreme limit here,” said Jon Doremus, who led the range project. “But there is a lot that you can learn from it. Things like looking ahead and driving for efficiency (and) maybe picking routes that are more efficient rather than taking the interstate if you have a little more time to get where you’re going.”

How to get the most range

Don’t drive with a lead foot. Constant acceleration takes energy. Silverado test drivers tried to increase speed before hills and coast up as much as possible before stepping on the “gas.” “When you see a hill coming, make sure you gain speed before it,” Doremus said, “and let it coast up the hill as much as you can.”

Brake slowly for a smooth ride and energy savings. Slamming on the brakes also wastes energy used during acceleration. “Rather than speeding up and then having to stop a lot for every stoplight,” coast as much as possible, Doremus said.

Use cruise control. Maintaining a constant speed offers the same energy savings with an EV as it does with gas-powered vehicles.

Maintain high tire pressure. The Silverado’s tires were filled to the maximum recommended pressure to increase efficiency.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.
In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.
An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59/20250809T121407/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 05:58:20.741087

“Heavy Rain and Flooding in China Kill At Least 30”

— Headlines in recent days

Yes, climate change is bad news, arriving as deadly fires and floods, a rush of hurricanes and tornadoes, drought and dangerous heat.

And life gets complicated when we try to mitigate the impacts. Traditional jobs are threatened, people are asked to sacrifice, taxes go higher and familiar ways of doing things go out the window.

Why can’t life be simple? Who the heck wants to pay extra money for an electric car or a roof-full of solar panels?

But there is this problem. Who wants to pretend the climate isn’t changing?

Folks in the Trump administration aren’t dismantling environmental research efforts because they’re expecting rosy results. They’re furloughing scientists to steer clear of findings that leads to difficult, costly and often unpopular choices. The Environmental Protection Agency “plans to ignore science, stop regulating greenhouse gases,” said the technology news site, Ars Technica.

Doing something about climate change, it should be said, might also inconvenience the people who bankrolled the current administration’s rise to power. For those folks, change is welcome so long as it doesn’t happen any time soon.

And so President Donald Trump kicks the can down the road, claiming — all evidence to the contrary — that climate change is a hoax. For too many companies, exemptions from environmental rules are now available for the asking. A recent headline in the New York Times: “Candidate Trump Promised Oil Executives a Windfall. Now, They’re Getting It.”

When the U.S. government pretends there’s nothing to see here, the winner will be China, which means to dominate the market for clean-energy technologies.

Here in Sonoma and Napa counties, we don’t need to search far and wide for examples of the havoc brought about by climate change. People’s lives were forever changed by the 2017 fires, which destroyed more than 5,900 homes and killed 31 people.

Catastrophes happen elsewhere as well. Just ask the folks in the Hill Country of central Texas where people are still missing a month after torrential rains and devastating floods. The death toll sits at 108.

Or ask the folks in Los Angeles where winds and heat in January — January! — caused the costliest fires in U.S. history. The 31st fatality was uncovered last month.

“Across the Northern Hemisphere,” the New York Times reported, “searing temperatures are breaking records, disrupting everyday life and costing lives.”

After taking note of deadly heat waves in Europe, Pakistan, China, Japan and the U.S., the article said the world is getting hotter faster. (Paradoxically, the deadly heat in Pakistan gave way to torrential rains and flooding that led to the deaths of 57 people, including many children.)

Meanwhile, scientists warned that a drought in the southwest United States could last for decades.

“Climate Change Is Making Fire Weather Worse for World’s Forests,” said a recent New York Times headline.

Wildfires are not new to California, but their severity is. There’s a reason 15 of the 20 most destructive fires in state history occurred in the past decade.

No one should wonder why insurance premiums are going through the roof (except, of course, when the insurance company cancels your coverage altogether). Questions now are being raised about the long-term viability of the state program meant to backstop the out-migration of private insurers.

Premiums will go higher, CalMatters reported, as insurers are granted permission to deploy so-called catastrophe modeling.

A new poll from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 79% of likely voters view climate change as a very serious or somewhat serious problem.

“Nowhere is the battle over climate change policy more urgent than in California,” reported CalMatters, teeing up a Sept. 17 conference on California and climate change. “The Golden State leads the nation with more EVs than any other, a gas car phaseout mandate, groundbreaking climate disclosure rules, and a dominance in solar and storage. But in 2025, that leadership is under siege.”

For residents hereabouts, the threat of wildfire stopped being theoretical early in the morning of Oct. 9, 2017. In Santa Rosa, the brooding, dawn sky gave way to thoughts of nuclear winter.

The devastation broke our hearts. We all know so many people who lost their homes and a lifetime of keepsakes. The stories of people fleeing in their bedclothes, of melted cars and of neighborhoods turned to ashes will live with us forever.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a new study found the wildfire season is starting earlier in California and human-caused climate change is the main cause.

It’s August. In the North Bay, this means the fire season has arrived, and it’s not going away soon enough.

You know the drill. Pack your go-bag, know your evacuation routes and be careful out there.

That includes more than $117 million for projects in Indiana.

The $7 billion Solar For All program set up under the Biden administration aimed to lower residents' energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin made the announcement on X Thursday. He said the agency plans to follow the intent of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin said.

Lower-income Hoosiers are more likely to live in older, less energy-efficient homes that use more power. Advocates said putting solar on these homes not only lowers their energy bills, but also reduces the need for more power plants — which all electric utility customers pay for.

The funding cut comes at a time when the average Indiana resident's bill has gone up by $28 a month since last year. Mo McReynolds directs Indianapolis's Office of Sustainability.

""Indianapolis, compared to other cities our size, has a particularly high energy burden — meaning the ratio of an average household income that gets paid toward their utility bills. We're particularly good candidate for a program like this,"" she said.

Alison Becker is with Solar Opportunities Indiana, a coalition helping to mange the grant funding. She said, without the federal dollars, most of the solar projects the group oversees won't move forward.

That includes plans to put solar and battery storage at libraries in lower-income, southern Indiana communities — which would help during storms when the power is out.

""The library can be made available to charge cell phones, be warm or be cool, have food available — just a place for the community to be and to be able to be safe,"" Becker said.

Denise Abdul-Rahman is the founder of Black Sunlight Sustainability, which has been helping to connect qualified communities and individuals to the program. She said the land and utility agreements have already been secured for several projects she's working on — but she'll need to find new funding.

""So it's just going to slow the pace, but now that we've done all of this work — there's no way we're going to stop,"" Abdul-Rahman said.

Becker said, according to the grant agreement, installers and other parties are only reimbursed after the work is done.

She said Solar Opportunities Indiana may consider legal action if Congress doesn't follow through with its funding obligations.

Inflation, geopolitical tensions, and regulatory shifts have created a landscape where only the most agile companies can thrive. Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) has emerged as a standout, not merely surviving but accelerating its growth trajectory. This article examines how the company's strategic positioning and operational execution have fortified its resilience, offering insights for investors navigating a sector in flux.

Financial Resilience Amid Macroeconomic Headwinds

Enphase's Q2 2025 results underscore its ability to deliver consistent profitability even as broader market conditions tighten. Revenue of $363.2 million, driven by $40.4 million in safe harbor revenue, reflects a diversified revenue stream that cushions against volatility. Non-GAAP gross margins of 48.6% and operating income of $98.6 million highlight a business model that prioritizes efficiency. With $1.53 billion in cash and marketable securities, Enphase's liquidity position is robust, providing flexibility to invest in innovation or weather short-term disruptions.

Strategic Positioning: Innovation and Market Expansion

Enphase's resilience stems from its dual focus on product innovation and geographic diversification. The launch of the fourth-generation Energy System, including the IQ Battery 10C, exemplifies its commitment to solving real-world challenges. The 30% increase in energy density and 62% reduction in wall space requirements address key pain points for residential customers, while the IQ Meter Collar's approval by 29 U.S. utilities accelerates grid integration.

In Europe, Enphase is capitalizing on the energy transition by ramping up shipments of the IQ Battery with FlexPhase to markets like Spain and Germany. The IQ Balcony Solar Kit, tailored for urban dwellers, taps into a previously underserved segment, demonstrating the company's ability to adapt to local demand. Meanwhile, the expansion of the IQ EV Charger 2 into new markets underscores its vision of integrating solar, storage, and electric vehicle infrastructure—a critical edge as the sector converges.

Operational Execution: Leveraging Policy and Supply Chain Strengths

Enphase's operational execution is equally compelling. The company's U.S. manufacturing efforts, which qualify for 45X production tax credits, align with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s incentives for domestic clean energy production. This not only reduces costs but also insulates Enphase from global supply chain bottlenecks. The $34–38 million net IRA benefit projected for Q3 2025 illustrates how policy tailwinds are being monetized.

Moreover, Enphase's digital platform, Solargraf, is a differentiator. Enhancements like AI-driven design tools and third-party ownership integrations streamline the customer journey for installers, fostering loyalty and scalability. These digital capabilities are critical in a sector where customer experience can dictate market share.

Navigating Challenges: Tariffs, Tax Credits, and Competition

Despite its strengths, Enphase faces headwinds. Reciprocal tariffs and the potential expiration of the 25D tax credit could pressure margins. However, the company's diversified product portfolio and IRA-driven domestic production mitigate these risks. For instance, the shift to U.S. manufacturing reduces exposure to international trade policies, while the IRA's 10-year tax credit window provides a buffer.

Competition from legacy players and new entrants remains a concern. Tesla's Solar Roof and LG's energy storage solutions are formidable, but Enphase's focus on modular, scalable systems for residential markets creates a niche. Its ability to integrate microinverters, batteries, and EV charging into a cohesive ecosystem positions it as a one-stop shop—a rarity in a fragmented sector.

Investment Outlook: A Cautious Bull Case

For investors, Enphase represents a compelling case of strategic foresight and operational discipline. The company's Q3 guidance—$330–370 million in revenue and 43–46% non-GAAP gross margins—suggests continued momentum. However, prudence is warranted. The clean energy sector's volatility means that macroeconomic shifts could test Enphase's resilience.

A long-term investor might consider ENPH as a core holding in a clean energy portfolio, given its leadership in residential solar and storage. Short-term traders, however, should monitor macroeconomic indicators and the company's ability to maintain margins amid rising component costs.

Conclusion

Enphase Energy's resilience lies in its ability to marry innovation with execution. By leveraging policy incentives, expanding into high-growth markets, and refining its product ecosystem, the company has positioned itself as a leader in distributed energy. While challenges persist, its financial strength and strategic agility make it a compelling candidate for investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition.

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!. This week’s show is quite heavy on US news – I’m sorry – but there’s some call to actions I can’t ignore.

We’re into August now, and that means July sales figures are trickling in. While not every automaker has reported, here’s what we know from the U.S. market.

Ford’s U.S. sales rose five percent year over year, but its EV sales dipped zero point two percent. The Mustang Mach E had its best July yet with just over five thousand three hundred sold, and F150 Lightning sales rose a little. The E-Transit, however, struggled, down eighty-nine percent. Honda logged a strong month, selling over six thousand three hundred Prologue EVs—an eighty-three percent year-over-year increase. That car’s cousin, the Chevrolet Equinox EV, helped GM boost EV sales one hundred and fifteen percent, with eight and a half thousand sold. Hyundai also had a record month for the brand, selling just over five thousand eight hundred IONIQ 5s. And outside of the U.S., Norway continues to lead globally—with ninety-seven point two percent of new cars sold there in July being fully electric.

From sales figures, we move on to quarterlies, with both Rivian and Lucid posting Q2 results this week.

Rivian beat revenue expectations, bringing in one point three billion dollars versus the expected one point two six billion, but posted a larger than expected net loss of one point one two billion. That’s an improvement over last year’s Q2 loss of one point four six billion, but reflects lower sales partly due to a temporary plant shutdown preparing for R2 production. Rivian expects some headwinds from tariffs and policy changes but says it’s on track to meet full-year production guidance, with R2 prep nearly complete. Meanwhile, Lucid posted Q2 revenue of two hundred fifty-nine point four million dollars and a loss of seven hundred ninety million, both missing Wall Street expectations. While Lucid’s figures show progress toward profitability—especially with new overseas sales—it lowered production guidance slightly, citing the “potential impact of continuously changing market environment and external factors,” which we all read as “President Trump”.

EV skeptics often say EVs have a larger lifecycle carbon footprint than internal combustion vehicles, due to the emissions from mining and refining materials for motors and batteries. But BMW has just published the receipts to prove otherwise—at least for its soon-to-launch iX3.

After just twenty-one thousand five hundred kilometers, or about thirteen thousand four hundred miles, its carbon footprint is lower than a comparable gas car when charged using the current European electrical grid mix. A big part of that is thanks to BMW’s low-emission production setup for its Neue Klasse EVs, of which the iX3 is the first. Using one hundred percent renewable energy, the break-even point drops to seventeen thousand five hundred kilometers, or about ten thousand eight hundred miles—making EVs the smart choice if you need a personal car and can’t take public transit.

Mid-week, General Motors and Hyundai announced progress has been made on a memorandum of understanding signed between the brands on shared vehicle platforms.

The two companies now say they will work together on co-developing five new vehicles, and while some of the work will result in hybrid and internal combustion engine models – something I’m personally a little frustrated to see – the collaboration also promises a new, jointly-designed electric commercial van which could launch in North America as early as twenty twenty-eight. While details are sparse right now, the EV development will be led by Hyundai, and result in a van that is smaller than the current BrightDrop delivery vans – vans, I should note, haven’t been selling so well of late.

One week ahead of its next-gen EV reveal, Ford has officially brought its Californian Skunkworks project out of “stealth mode”.

Based in Long Beach, the once-secret site now wears a Ford logo and looks more like a startup than a car company. It’s staffed with former Tesla, Apple, and Silicon Valley engineers, and the group is focused on fast-tracking Ford’s next electric platforms—and the open, modern workspace reflects that mission. Meanwhile, Ford has filed a trademark for the Ranchero name, for use in a future vehicle. Given the original was a muscle-car pickup, and Ford’s fondness for reviving legacy badges for EVs, I suspect that’s the name we’re going to see for Ford’s soon-to-be-revealed lower-cost, smaller-footprint pickup. Since we have just a few days until the event, you can bet we’ll be covering it more next week!

It’s no secret the U.S. Government—under President Trump—is working to eliminate federal support for electric vehicles. But individual states aren’t all following suit.

In Indiana, GOEVIN (that’s Go Electric Vehicle Indiana) just allocated three point three million dollars in funding to state projects that aim to expand DC fast charging and Level 2 charging infrastructure statewide. Half a continent away, the California Energy Commission launched a new fifty-five million dollar Fast Charge California program this week to cover up to one hundred percent of installation costs for EV fast chargers at businesses and public sites across the state, with applications open through October 29th. And, in a separate funding push, CALSTART has announced a fifty-six and a half million dollar program in California to help fund EV charger installations at multifamily homes and other tenant-accessible locations—addressing charging access for renters across the state.

EV startup Polestar — originally a performance sub-brand of Volvo and now a standalone marque — is technically a Chinese company, as it’s owned by Geely, despite many of its vehicles being designed in Sweden and built outside of China.

This week, we learned that while Polestar’s sales in Europe and the U.S. grew by fifty-one percent year-over-year during the first half of 2025, its sales in China have plummeted. According to multiple Chinese media reports, the company now has just one physical retail location in China — in Shanghai — and has halted online sales. Test drives are reportedly only available by appointment, and rumors suggest Polestar may exit the Chinese market entirely by year’s end. Of the more than thirty thousand vehicles Polestar sold globally in the first half of 2025, just sixty-nine were sold in China — a grim figure in a country where the top five EV manufacturers collectively sold more than two million vehicles during the same period.

Since January, we’ve steered clear of covering Tesla due to its CEO’s persistent promotion of far-right rhetoric. However, recent developments have compelled us to mention it beyond the usual recall notices—because of its growing negative impact on the industry.

This week, multiple outlets reported that Tesla owes more than twenty-four million dollars to small independent suppliers and contractors—many of whom have declared bankruptcy while waiting for payment on work completed at the company’s Texas Gigafactory. At the same time, Tesla faces a growing number of lawsuits, including allegations of securities fraud over its Robotaxi claims, wrongful death suits linked to Autopilot crashes, and accusations that it misled crash investigators and plaintiffs. Since many people still treat Tesla as synonymous with EVs, the company’s actions are already affecting the wider electric vehicle market. One study published last week suggests Elon Musk’s behavior is fueling a broader backlash against EV adoption. And yet, Tesla’s board—acting independently of shareholders—has just approved a twenty-nine billion dollar pay package for Musk, despite ongoing legal challenges over past compensation deals. It’s up to the industry—and all of us—to stand up to this kind of behavior.

The U.S. State of Georgia’s statewide initiative, Georgia BRIGHT, launched a new program this week offering qualifying low-income homeowners a chance to get rooftop solar installed for free.

It’s part of the federal Solar for All initiative, a seven billion dollar program funded by the Biden administration to make solar more accessible. In Georgia, the program has enough funding to cover four hundred installations this year for families earning less than eighty percent of their county’s area median income, with another four hundred systems planned for next year. Yet the U.S. EPA just confirmed it’s contacting all the states, non-profits, and Tribal nations that received Solar for All funding—demanding the money back. If successful—and it’s legally murky whether the federal government can claw back funds already appropriated by law—it could devastate low-cost solar programs nationwide.

If you’re in the U.S., this kind of behavior from the federal government is becoming de rigueur—but in a week where President Trump rescinded all Wind Energy Areas in U.S. coastal waters and ordered a sweeping review of all wind turbine permitting nationwide, now is the time to act.

As we noted in last week’s show, the EPA is trying to erase the 2009 Endangerment Finding—a foundational ruling that enabled decades of clean air and pollution regulations. If successful, it could gut fuel economy standards, eliminate polluter fines, and unravel environmental protections nationwide. Before the proposed rollback becomes law, there’s a legally required public consultation period—and it just opened this week. If you’re in the U.S., you have until September fifteenth to make your voice heard, and there are virtual public hearings scheduled for August nineteenth and twentieth.

Links are in the show notes to help you through the process—and let us know in the comments if you’d like a video on how to effectively make your voice heard by the… Enriching Polluters Administration.

And those are your news shorts! There will be more next week!

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the United States — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through installing solar panels or getting a heat pump. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on our roof, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit — will disappear soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it’s important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support our show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology is something I’m a big fan of — I even made a video this week showing how I powered this studio from an EV during a power outage.

Many people worry that using V2G or vehicle-to-home (V2H) systems will harm EV battery life. But new research from RWTH Aachen University, a leading German technical university, and The Mobility House Energy shows the long-term impact on battery capacity is minimal. Their study found that after ten years of V2G use, battery capacity drops by about twenty-one percent, compared to eighteen percent for a similar vehicle driven the same distance without V2G. That means only around a six-mile (ten kilometer) difference in WTLP range over ten years — a small effect most won’t notice. So go ahead: use your EV to add energy stability at home without fearing serious battery wear.

And finally,

Automakers love celebrating when their vehicles do something new or unusual—be it a world tour or a speed record—for marketing hype.

A few weeks ago, I mentioned a downhill (still impressive) range test in Europe with a Lucid Air Gravity. It set a new Guinness World Record for longest distance on a single EV charge, though the downhill route helped. This week, GM chased similar attention. Engineers drove the Chevrolet Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck over one thousand fifty-nine miles (about one thousand seven hundred five kilometres) on a single charge—more than double its EPA range. Unlike the Lucid trip, this was done at just twenty to twenty-five miles per hour (around thirty-two to forty kilometres per hour) near GM’s Milford Proving Ground. Drivers hypermiled by turning off AC and inflating tires fully. They celebrated with a 3D-printed trophy, but honestly, it’s mostly a stunt. I’ve got a video planned, so let’s leave it there.

Before I go, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all. Join the EVA today to find out how to become an EV educator, meet like-minded fans, get help to make your own transition to electric – help that includes a low-interest loan program to help finance your next step!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. YouTube is now a cesspool of AI nonsense and trolls, has yet-again reduced creator ad payout, and while we’d love to host elsewhere there’s not really a good alternative right now (and no, Nebula is invite-only). So right now, Patreon really is our only reliable form of income. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position. Right now, we’re surviving on the occasional generous stipend that helps boost our coffers, but I’m not going to lie, the lack of YouTube revenue has led to many a sleepless nights. Our team does deserve normal things – like healthcare and a living wage.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. You’ll also find merch at our swag store, and amazon affiliate links in this video description or on our website that you can use to support TE when you worship at the altar of Bezos.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

To finish, remember this:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what hateful sods try to claim.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

This week has been particularly hard on those of us who have been abused, and those of us in the LGBTQIA+ communities, and if you’ve needed to turn off the news or take a rest and step back from the outside world, please know that’s okay. It’s important to take care of yourself. So, when you’re feeling better, you can come back, stronger than before, to stand up for decency, community and justice. Don’t let the … you know what… win. Especially JK Trolling. Which is what my almost blind mother accidentally typed in a message to me this week. That’s what I’m going to call her from now on.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

Chen said the Trump administration's decision to strip EPA employees of their collective bargaining protections will lead to less safe practices: ""Make no mistake, this move isn’t about government efficiency or national security.
It’s about silencing workers and clearing the way for more deregulation so corporate polluters can have free reign.
Chen said EPA employees work on issues most Americans likely take for granted everyday.","WASHINGTON — On Friday, the Trump administration and the Environmental Protection Agency stripped employees of their collective bargaining agreement, according to union representatives.

Justin Chen, who is the President of the Association of Government Employees Council 238, says there are a lot of mixed feelings from him and the more than 8000 workers he represents.

""It’s a lot of different things,"" he said. ""It’s anger, disappointment.""

But one thing Chen wasn't feeling was shock at the announcement.

""It wasn’t surprising at all,"" he said.

Chen says their collective bargaining agreement doesn't involve wages. That responsibility is left to Congress. But instead, it includes something called a ""scientific integrity article,"" which essentially is a form of free speech.

""That basically guaranteed their right to speak up and be able to go out to the public and voice their unedited opinion as long as they did not make representations on behalf of the agency, but as their own scientific engineer,"" Chen said. ""They could go out and speak their mind, essentially.""

""One of the things apparently that this administration really does not like within our contract is that we have a scientific integrity article,"" Chen added.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March invoking the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 to end collective bargaining at dozens of federal agencies by declaring their primary function to be “intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.” Federal judges in D.C. and San Franciso granted preliminary injunctions blocking the order, with one, Judge Paul Friedman, saying it appeared to ""target"" unions who've filed many of the legal challenges to Trump's moves to drastically shrink the size of the federal government.

In May, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted that injunction and earlier this week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted a similar order, paving the way for the administration to proceed.

Chen said the Trump administration's decision to strip EPA employees of their collective bargaining protections will lead to less safe practices:

""Make no mistake, this move isn’t about government efficiency or national security. It’s about silencing workers and clearing the way for more deregulation so corporate polluters can have free reign. These are the same industries that bankrolled Trump’s campaign and now stand to profit while Americans pay the price with their health and with our environment.""

Chen said EPA employees work on issues most Americans likely take for granted everyday.

""We are people who are dedicated to being public servants. We don’t do this job to get rich,"" he said. ""We do this job because we have a passion to protect the citizens of this country to guarantee them clean air, clean water and uncontaminated soil to be able to live on.""",https://media.wusa9.com/assets/WUSA/images/b3b0f9d4-97e5-4251-b267-b94376be13d9/20250808T025521/b3b0f9d4-97e5-4251-b267-b94376be13d9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 03:57:58.198705

This is a game-changer for a company that posted a $335 million automotive gross loss in Q2 2025.
With the tax credit set to expire in September 2025, Rivian is pushing buyers to pull forward purchases in Q3 2025.
- Bearish Case: Avoid RIVN until the R2's production and demand risks are validated.","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has long been a poster child for the challenges facing non-Tesla electric vehicle (EV) startups. Despite its bold vision and early hype, the company has struggled with declining deliveries, razor-thin margins, and macroeconomic headwinds. Its Q2 2025 results—$1.12 billion in net losses, a -16% gross margin, and a $667 million adjusted EBITDA loss—underscore the urgency for a turnaround. Enter the R2: Rivian's upcoming midsize SUV, positioned as a lifeline to reverse its fortunes. But can this vehicle truly offset the company's mounting pressures?

The Current Crossroads: Margins, Deliveries, and Macro Risks

Rivian's financial struggles are no secret. The company's Q2 2025 gross loss of $206 million (a -16% margin) marked a stark reversal from positive margins in Q4 2024. This decline is attributed to underutilized production capacity, rising tariffs (25% on EVs and parts), and the impending expiration of the $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025. Analysts project adjusted EBITDA losses for 2025 to range between $2 billion and $2.25 billion, a 14% increase from prior guidance.

Meanwhile, Rivian's delivery growth has been uneven. While Q2 2025 deliveries rose to 10,661 units (up from 5,979 produced), this was largely due to inventory carryover from Q1. The company's 2025 delivery guidance of 40,000–46,000 vehicles remains ambitious, but its Q2 performance highlights the fragility of demand in a market saturated with competitors like Tesla (TSLA) and BYD.

The R2: A Strategic Pivot to Mass Market

Rivian's R2, slated for a 2026 launch, is its most aggressive attempt yet to break into the mass market. Priced between $45,000 and $50,000, the R2 targets a segment where Rivian currently has no presence: affordable, family-friendly EVs. This is a critical move, as SUVs account for 50% of U.S. vehicle sales, yet Rivian's current R1 lineup (R1S and R1T) is priced well above the median EV buyer's budget.

The R2's strategic advantages are threefold:

1. Cost Efficiency: Rivian has locked in materials costs for the R2 at 50% less than the R1, with a projected bill of materials of $32,000 per unit. This is a game-changer for a company that posted a $335 million automotive gross loss in Q2 2025.

2. Production Scalability: The R2 will be built at Rivian's Normal, Illinois facility, which is being retooled to produce 155,000 units annually. This scale could reduce fixed costs per unit and improve gross margins.

3. Competitive Positioning: The R2's rugged design, genuine off-road capabilities, and NACS compatibility (enabling Tesla Supercharger use) differentiate it from rivals like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5. Its camping-friendly features and sustainable interior materials also cater to Rivian's core audience of outdoor enthusiasts.

Addressing Macro Risks: Tariffs, Tax Credits, and Tariffs

Rivian's CFO, Claire McDonough, has acknowledged that Trump-era tariffs and the loss of EV tax credits will weigh on 2025 cash flows. However, the R2's U.S.-based production (avoiding 25% import tariffs) and eligibility for the full $7,500 tax credit mitigate these risks. The company has also stockpiled batteries to hedge against potential supply chain disruptions.

The R2's timing is equally strategic. With the tax credit set to expire in September 2025, Rivian is pushing buyers to pull forward purchases in Q3 2025. This could provide a short-term sales boost while the R2's launch in 2026 captures demand from consumers priced out of the R1 lineup.

Analyst Projections and Risks to Watch

Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Zacks Investment Research has revised 2026 EPS estimates upward by 15 cents, reflecting confidence in the R2's potential to drive margin expansion. The $1 billion Volkswagen investment (part of a $5.8 billion joint venture) also signals external validation of Rivian's strategy.

However, risks persist:

- Production Delays: Rivian's Q2 2025 production of 10,661 units fell short of its 14,611-unit output in Q1, raising concerns about its ability to scale. A three-week factory shutdown in September 2025 to retool for R2 production could further strain delivery timelines.

- Demand Uncertainty: Rivian has not disclosed pre-order numbers for the R2. In a market dominated by Tesla's Model Y and BYD's ATTO 3, the R2 must prove its appeal to budget-conscious buyers.

- Margin Pressures: Even with cost reductions, Rivian's Q2 2025 gross margin of -16% suggests that achieving positive margins will require more than just the R2—it will need sustained production efficiency and pricing discipline.

Investment Implications: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play

For investors, the R2 represents a pivotal inflection point. If Rivian can execute on its production and cost-cutting plans, the R2 could catalyze a path to profitability. The vehicle's affordability, U.S. production, and strategic partnerships (e.g., Volkswagen) position it as a strong contender in the midsize EV segment.

However, the risks are significant. Rivian's stock has underperformed Tesla and BYD, and its financials remain unprofitable. A successful R2 launch would require not only strong demand but also disciplined cost management and timely production.

Investment Advice:

- Bullish Case: Buy RIVN ahead of the R2's 2026 launch if Rivian demonstrates progress in production efficiency and secures strong pre-orders. The R2's potential to drive margin expansion and volume growth could justify a re-rating.

- Bearish Case: Avoid RIVN until the R2's production and demand risks are validated. The company's liquidity ($7.5 billion in cash) provides a buffer, but prolonged losses could erode investor confidence.

In conclusion, the R2 is Rivian's best bet to reverse its earnings trends. While the path to profitability is fraught with challenges, the R2's strategic advantages—cost efficiency, scalability, and market positioning—make it a compelling long-term play for investors with a high risk tolerance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 13:06:56.965657

Engineers at the automaker recently piloted a 2026 Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck model across 1,059.2 miles on a single battery charge, eclipsing the prior record of 749 miles set by a Lucid sedan. This achievement, conducted over seven days on public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground in Michigan and around Detroit’s Belle Isle, highlights not just battery prowess but also the strategic optimizations that can extend range far beyond standard estimates.

The test vehicle, equipped with a massive battery pack estimated at over 200 kilowatt-hours, adhered to production specifications but incorporated minor modifications like aerodynamic wheel covers and low-rolling-resistance tires. These tweaks, combined with hypermiling techniques—driving at speeds as low as 25 mph to minimize energy consumption—allowed the truck to more than double its EPA-rated range of 493 miles. GM’s team rotated drivers in shifts, ensuring continuous operation without recharging, a process that demanded meticulous planning to avoid depleting the battery prematurely.

Engineering Ingenuity Behind the Record

Details from the drive reveal a blend of innovation and pragmatism. As reported by The Verge, the Silverado EV’s Ultium platform played a pivotal role, leveraging advanced cell chemistry for superior energy density. Unlike typical consumer scenarios, where acceleration and highway speeds drain power quickly, this record attempt prioritized efficiency, with the truck averaging under 20 mph over the marathon journey. Such conditions aren’t replicable in everyday use, but they demonstrate the untapped potential in EV hardware when pushed to extremes.

Industry observers note that this isn’t an official Guinness World Record, as it lacked independent verification, yet it serves as a powerful marketing tool for GM amid intensifying competition in the electric pickup segment. Rivals like Ford’s F-150 Lightning and Rivian’s R1T offer ranges around 300-500 miles, but none have attempted such an extended single-charge demonstration. The Silverado’s performance, as detailed in Motor1, underscores how software calibrations and driver behavior can dramatically influence outcomes, raising questions about the relevance of EPA figures in real-world applications.

Implications for the EV Market and Consumer Expectations

For industry insiders, this record illuminates broader trends in battery technology and vehicle design. GM’s investment in larger packs contrasts with efforts by Tesla and others to optimize aerodynamics and weight for efficiency. According to Car and Driver, the slow-speed strategy effectively halved energy use per mile, a tactic that could inform future autonomous or fleet operations where speed is secondary to endurance. However, critics argue that such feats, while impressive, may mislead consumers expecting similar results in daily driving, where traffic, cargo, and climate control sap range.

Looking ahead, this milestone could accelerate adoption in commercial sectors like delivery and construction, where long-haul capability without frequent charging is prized. GM plans to roll out the 2026 Silverado EV with enhanced features, potentially incorporating lessons from this test to refine over-the-air updates for better efficiency. As Electrek points out, the drive’s success challenges assumptions about EV limitations, particularly for heavy-duty trucks, and positions GM as a leader in pushing boundaries.

Challenges and Future Horizons in Electric Mobility

Despite the triumph, hurdles remain. The seven-day duration highlights the impracticality for most users, and environmental factors like temperature weren’t detailed, which can swing range by 20% or more. Publications such as Electrive emphasize that while the Silverado’s battery tech is cutting-edge, scaling such endurance to affordable models requires cost reductions in materials like lithium and nickel.

Ultimately, this record signals a maturation in EV engineering, where hardware meets human ingenuity to redefine possibilities. For automakers, it sets a high bar, prompting investments in next-gen batteries that could one day make 1,000-mile ranges routine, not exceptional. As the industry shifts toward electrification, feats like this from GM may well catalyze innovations that benefit fleets and individual owners alike, bridging the gap between laboratory potential and on-road reality.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-321f50bc-ea64-410a-b234-1a239d46af0a.jpeg,N,,2025-08-10 02:07:58.502920

An engineering team within the Detroit automotive giant managed to push the single-charge EV range record into triple digits, beating out the ever-slippery Lucid Air GT sedan by over 300 miles (483 km) with the Silverado EV. A pickup truck.

As announced last October, the 2025 Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck (8WT) boasts an EPA-estimated range of 492 miles (792 km), shooting right past the Teslas and Rivians of the world to park comfortably behind the 516-mile (830-km) Lucid Air Grand S Touring at the tippity top of the US market range leader list. Its 68-mpg-e efficiency is far less impressive, but you can't call it a slouch when it comes to long-hauling on a single charge.

Well before Lucid's sedan had set its recent 749-mile (1,205-km) mark, itself a full 100 miles (161 km) farther than the previous record, some GM engineers began theorizing about how far the Silverado Max Range WT commercial pickup might actually go with a little bit of forethought and precise execution. Some voices among the group were particularly ambitious: 1,000 miles (1,609 km) didn't seem out of reach.

A proper challenge was formulated, and the team began driving a production Silverado MR WT to fine-tune their hypermiling strategies.

""Getting this kind of range on a full charge doesn’t happen by accident,"" explained Kurt Kelty, GM VP of battery, propulsion and sustainability. ""It takes deep integration across battery chemistry, drive unit efficiency, software and vehicle engineering.""

Each engineer brought in his or her own expertise when developing driving strategies, and the team quickly dialed in a holistic game plan. Some of the strategies were fairly obvious mileage-boosting techniques and/or luxuries available to an engineering team that might not be available to an everyday driver. For instance, the driver was mostly alone to cut out the additional weight of passengers, and the truck's spare tire was left behind to further slash weight.

Heavily modifying the vehicle would have gone completely against the spirit of the challenge, but the team did make some slight alterations that stayed within the letter of the user manual. They inflated all tires to the highest recommended pressure to cut rolling resistance, fine-tuned the wheel alignment for optimal performance, and set the windshield wipers as low as possible to minimize drag. They also added a tonneau cover over the bed for smoother airflow.

The timing of the feat was no coincidence, either, as the Michigan summer afforded the best possible ambient conditions for battery performance. It didn't, however, provide the best possible ambient conditions for driving around with no A/C whatsoever – GM's team took one for science and left the climate control off for the duration of the driving mission.

The final strategy might make the challenge especially difficult – or at least highly tedious – to repeat for regular Silverado EV owners. Whenever safe to do so, each driver maintained a speed in the 20- to 25-mph (32- to 40-km/h) range, which was determined to be the most efficient possible cruising range. At such low speeds, they found, virtually all of the truck's battery power was directed into propulsion, with minimal energy getting sucked up by other systems and functions.

GM calls that 20- to 25-mph sweet spot ""a realistic pace for neighborhood or city driving in southeast Michigan,"" which is fair enough, but it's a tough pace to maintain when actually aspiring to travel a full 1,000 miles – or 492 miles, for that matter. Drivers could always circle their residential neighborhood hundreds of times, try to get stuck in slow-moving city traffic for days on end, or otherwise drive 1,000 miles without really going anywhere, but we think the ""safe to do so"" caveat would prevent holding that speed on long A-to-B trips, particularly if the definition of safety extends to not creating a massive tail of angry drivers behind you.

The purpose here, though, was entirely on pushing the Silverado EV, and its hulking 205-kWh battery, to its absolute limit so recreating any type of realistic driving scenario was not a prerequisite. Drivers took one-hour shifts to fit the challenge into their regular workdays, driving the truck around a pre-mapped section of public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground, ultimately wrapping up in Detroit's Belle Isle – essentially 1,000 miles worth of driving inside 50 miles of point-to-point distance.

We actually just rounded to a clean, even 1,000 miles, but to get precise, the team pushed the Silverado EV all the way to 1,059.2 miles on a single charge, a full 310 (500 km) beyond Lucid's Guinness World Record mileage from last month. Lucid need not worry, though, as its record still sits comfortably in the Guinness book. GM makes no mention of Guinness or any third-party verification and really treated the feat as an internal engineering and R&D challenge.

As Washington Pivots, Automakers Face a Rocky Road for Electric Cars, But the Road Ahead Remains Electrified.

The rumble of internal combustion engines has long been the soundtrack to American life, a symbol of freedom and industrial might. But as the nation hurtles toward a future increasingly defined by electric vehicles (EVs), a significant shift in the political landscape threatens to put the brakes on this transformative journey. The incoming Trump administration, backed by a Republican Congress, has signaled a clear intent to dismantle federal incentives that have been crucial in nurturing the nascent EV market. While this move is poised to slow the transition, the fundamental forces driving EV adoption – technological advancement, evolving consumer demand, and global automotive industry trends – suggest that the rise of electric cars may be more resilient than it appears.

This article delves into the implications of the Trump administration’s anti-EV policies, examining the context and background that led to this point, analyzing the potential impact on automakers and consumers, and exploring the broader pros and cons of such a regulatory shift. We will also highlight key takeaways, offer a glimpse into the future outlook for EVs in the United States, and consider what actions might be necessary to navigate this evolving landscape.

Context & Background: A Shifting Political Climate

The adoption of electric vehicles in the United States has been a story of steady, albeit sometimes uneven, growth. For years, a bipartisan consensus, at least at the federal level, acknowledged the environmental and economic benefits of transitioning to cleaner transportation. This led to the establishment and continuation of various federal incentives designed to encourage EV adoption. These incentives typically took the form of tax credits for consumers purchasing qualifying electric vehicles, alongside investments in charging infrastructure and research and development.

The Biden administration, in particular, made significant strides in promoting EVs. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a cornerstone of its climate agenda, significantly expanded and extended tax credits for EV purchases, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers. The administration also set ambitious targets for EV sales and charging infrastructure deployment, aiming to solidify the U.S. as a leader in the global EV race. These policies were instrumental in boosting consumer confidence and providing the automotive industry with a clear roadmap and financial support for its massive investments in EV technology and manufacturing.

However, a significant political realignment has brought Donald Trump back to the presidency, with a Republican majority in Congress. Throughout his previous term and during his recent campaign, Trump has expressed skepticism, if not outright opposition, towards policies aimed at combating climate change and promoting renewable energy. His rhetoric has often favored traditional industries, including fossil fuels, and he has frequently criticized EVs as impractical, expensive, and a threat to American jobs in the automotive sector. The elimination of federal EV incentives is a direct manifestation of this ideological stance.

The rationale behind the proposed rollback of incentives, as articulated by Trump and his allies, often centers on cost-effectiveness and consumer choice. They argue that tax credits are an unnecessary government expenditure that distorts the market and that consumers should be free to choose the vehicles they prefer without federal subsidies. Furthermore, there’s a narrative that the push for EVs is driven by environmental elites and is not aligned with the economic realities of many American workers, particularly those in manufacturing and fossil fuel-dependent regions.

In-Depth Analysis: The Ripple Effect of Withdrawn Incentives

The removal of federal EV incentives will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the automotive market. For consumers, the most immediate effect will be an increase in the upfront cost of purchasing an electric vehicle. The tax credits, which could reduce the price of an EV by thousands of dollars, were a critical factor in bridging the initial price gap between EVs and comparable gasoline-powered cars. Without these subsidies, the sticker price of many EVs will become a significant barrier for a substantial segment of the buying public.

This could lead to a slowdown in the rate of EV adoption, particularly among mass-market consumers who are more price-sensitive. While early adopters and environmentally conscious buyers may continue to invest in EVs, the broader consumer base that the incentives were designed to attract might be deterred. This could disproportionately affect lower and middle-income households, widening the accessibility gap for cleaner transportation options.

For automakers, the impact is multifaceted. On one hand, car manufacturers have already committed billions of dollars to developing and producing EVs. This investment is driven by a confluence of factors beyond government policy, including increasingly stringent global emissions regulations, a growing demand from international markets, and the realization that the future of personal transportation is electric. Companies like General Motors, Ford, and Tesla have invested heavily in battery technology, new manufacturing facilities, and retraining their workforces for the EV era. They cannot simply turn off these investments overnight.

The challenge for automakers will be to absorb the increased cost of EVs or find ways to reduce production costs more rapidly to maintain competitive pricing without federal support. This could lead to a greater reliance on their existing internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales to subsidize their EV operations, a strategy that may not be sustainable in the long run as the market inevitably shifts. Some automakers might be forced to re-evaluate their EV production targets or even delay the introduction of certain EV models.

Furthermore, the rollback of incentives could create a less predictable and more volatile market for EV manufacturers and suppliers. The absence of a consistent federal policy framework can make long-term planning more difficult. Companies may become more hesitant to make significant new investments in battery plants or charging infrastructure without the assurance of government backing.

The impact on charging infrastructure development is another crucial consideration. While private investment is growing, federal support has played a vital role in expanding the public charging network, especially in rural areas and underserved communities. A reduction in federal funding could slow the pace of this expansion, creating range anxiety for potential EV buyers and further hindering adoption.

Pros and Cons: A Balanced Perspective

The decision to eliminate federal EV incentives, like most policy decisions, presents a range of potential benefits and drawbacks. Understanding these is key to grasping the broader implications.

Potential Pros:

Reduced Government Spending: The most direct benefit cited by proponents is the reduction in federal spending on subsidies. This can free up taxpayer money for other priorities or contribute to deficit reduction.

Market-Driven Innovation: A purely market-driven approach, proponents argue, will force manufacturers to innovate and reduce the cost of EVs more aggressively to compete on price alone. This could lead to more efficient and cost-effective solutions in the long run.

Consumer Choice: Removing incentives allows consumers to make purchasing decisions based solely on their preferences and budgets, without the influence of government mandates or subsidies.

Focus on Other Priorities: A shift away from EV incentives could allow the government to redirect resources towards other critical areas, such as traditional infrastructure projects or national defense, depending on the administration’s priorities.

Fairness for Existing Owners: Some argue that removing incentives addresses a perceived unfairness towards owners of traditional gasoline-powered vehicles who do not benefit from EV subsidies.

Potential Cons:

Slower EV Adoption: The most significant drawback is the anticipated slowdown in the rate of EV adoption, hindering progress towards climate goals and reducing air quality improvements.

Increased Upfront Cost for Consumers: Without tax credits, the initial purchase price of EVs will be higher, potentially making them inaccessible to a large portion of the population.

Impact on Domestic Auto Industry: Automakers that have heavily invested in EV production may face increased financial pressure, potentially leading to job losses or a slowdown in domestic manufacturing expansion if international demand doesn’t fully compensate.

Reduced Competitiveness in Global EV Market: Other countries are continuing to offer strong incentives for EVs, potentially putting U.S. automakers at a disadvantage in the global market.

Slower Charging Infrastructure Development: Reduced federal investment could lead to a less robust and slower expansion of public charging networks, exacerbating range anxiety.

Missed Environmental Opportunities: A slower transition to EVs means continued reliance on fossil fuels for transportation, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and their associated environmental consequences.

Key Takeaways

Federal incentives for electric vehicle (EV) purchases are being eliminated under the new Trump administration and Republican Congress.

This policy shift is expected to slow the rate of EV adoption in the United States due to increased upfront costs for consumers.

Automakers have made substantial, long-term investments in EV technology and manufacturing and will likely continue to produce EVs, but may face financial pressures.

The pace of charging infrastructure expansion could also be affected by reduced federal funding.

While a setback for rapid EV transition, global market trends, technological advancements, and growing consumer interest suggest that the long-term rise of EVs is likely to continue, albeit at a potentially slower pace.

The economic and environmental implications of this policy shift are significant and will likely be debated for years to come.

Future Outlook: Navigating the New Landscape

Despite the removal of federal incentives, the trajectory of the automotive industry suggests that the transition to electric vehicles is unlikely to be entirely halted. Several powerful forces are working in favor of EVs, even in a less supportive policy environment:

Global Regulatory Trends: Many other major automotive markets, including Europe and China, are implementing even more aggressive policies to promote EVs and phase out internal combustion engines. U.S. automakers that wish to remain competitive globally will continue to invest in and produce EVs to meet these international demands.

Technological Advancements: Battery technology is constantly improving, leading to increased range, faster charging times, and falling costs. These inherent improvements in EV technology will make them more attractive to consumers regardless of government incentives.

Consumer Demand: While price is a significant factor, consumer awareness of environmental issues, the desire for lower running costs (electricity is often cheaper than gasoline per mile), and the appeal of new technology are also driving demand for EVs. This organic demand is likely to persist and grow.

Automaker Commitments: As mentioned, major automakers have already made massive investments and public commitments to electrifying their lineups. Abandoning these commitments would incur significant financial penalties and reputational damage. They will likely continue to push their EV strategies, perhaps with a greater emphasis on cost reduction and efficiency.

The future may see a bifurcated market. The most affordable EVs, those with shorter ranges or less advanced features, might struggle to gain traction without subsidies. Meanwhile, premium EVs or those with compelling technological advantages might continue to sell well to a more affluent customer base. The success of Tesla, a company built on innovation and direct-to-consumer sales without relying heavily on traditional dealer networks or early federal subsidies, offers a potential model for navigating a less supportive policy environment.

State-level policies will also become increasingly important. States like California, which have their own emissions standards and aggressive EV mandates, may continue to drive EV adoption within their borders, potentially creating regional markets that influence national trends.

Call to Action: Charting a Course for Electrification

The current policy shift presents both challenges and opportunities. For consumers, it underscores the importance of thorough research into the total cost of ownership for EVs, considering fuel savings and potential maintenance benefits that can offset higher upfront prices. Staying informed about state-level incentives and the evolving charging infrastructure landscape will be crucial.

For the automotive industry, the imperative is to accelerate innovation focused on cost reduction and to advocate for policies that foster a predictable and supportive environment for EV manufacturing and sales. This includes exploring partnerships for charging infrastructure development and engaging in public education campaigns to highlight the benefits of EVs.

Policymakers, at all levels, have a role to play. While federal incentives may be on the chopping block, there is still an opportunity to foster the EV transition through other means, such as investing in charging infrastructure, supporting research and development for battery technology, and implementing clear, long-term emissions standards that provide industry certainty. Open dialogue between government, industry, and consumers is vital to ensure that the transition to electric mobility, however it unfolds, benefits the nation as a whole, contributing to economic growth, energy independence, and a cleaner environment for future generations.",https://ibossumind.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IBOSSUMIND-Digital-Design-Banner2.png,N,,2025-08-10 16:00:05.390080

Scientific research shows it’s not too late to implement large-scale measures to stop and even reverse climate change if society acts now.
Even the issue of insurance premiums would be addressed if we had a government that put people’s needs first.","Climate change is leading to more frequent and intense weather events. As a result, many insurance companies are raising their rates or even exiting certain markets altogether because they cannot make a profit. Insurance is a huge industry claiming to care for people in their most difficult times, which in reality exists to make a profit by gambling on the chance that most consumers will not actually need their services.

Meanwhile as climate change-linked storms cause costly damages and companies increase rates, the Trump administration is doubling down on climate denialism. This dynamic can be seen in Illinois.

Beginning Aug. 15, about one third of Illinois homeowners will see an increase in their insurance premiums. State Farm stated last month their premiums would be going up. How much will the working class be expected to pay? The increase will cost the average policyholder around $350 annually. According to State Farm, the increase in premiums is due to more intense and damaging storms in the Midwest, as well as the rising costs in home replacements.

In 2024, for every $1.00 in homeowner’s premiums collected from Illinois policyholders, State Farm paid out $1.26 in total costs.

This isn’t the first time that State Farm has used extreme weather as an excuse to hike up prices for homeowners. Last year, the company said that Illinois had $638 million in hail damage claims, second in the nation only to Texas, which had $1.1 billion in damages. In their filing, the company stated: “Over the last several years, our catastrophe provision has proven to be inadequate when compared to our actual catastrophe loss experience. While there is volatility associated with extreme weather events, our Illinois catastrophe losses have exceeded the year’s catastrophe provision in 13 of the last 15 years, signaling the provision used in rating has been insufficient in recent history.”

Illinois is one of the least restrictive states in the country when it comes to insurance. Unlike many other states, insurers in the state of Illinois are able to hike their prices without regulatory approval before or after the fact. Insurers in Illinois are only required to inform the regulators when they do so.

State Farm, headquartered in Bloomington, Illinois, has been criticized by Illinois governor J.B. Pritzke: “These increases are predicated on catastrophe loss numbers that are entirely inconsistent with the Illinois Department of Insurance’s own analysis — indicating that State Farm is shifting out-of-state costs onto the homeowners in our state . . . Hard-working Illinoisans should not be paying more to protect beach houses in Florida.” Pritzker is now advocating for more regulations in the state to help prevent more hikes here in the state of Illinois.

However, Illinoisans aren’t the only ones experiencing premium hikes. In fact, homeowners all over the country can expect to see increases happening soon. Extreme weather events don’t discriminate and we have seen this in real time as places like California, Florida, Texas and many more states have been hugely impacted in the last couple of years. Homeowners have experienced hikes in their insurance premiums and will most likely continue to see them unless immediate action is taken. The Consumer Federation of America published a report in April showing U.S. homeowners’ premiums increased by an average of 24% over the last three years. CFA found homeowners, nationally, saw premiums rise twice as fast between 2021 and 2024, which amounts to a $21 billion total price hike.

The truth is that extreme weather events are rising and becoming the new normal. These extreme climate events aren’t just happening in the state of Illinois. The entire country has been hit repeatedly. According to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, in 2024 there were 27 individual weather and climate disasters that resulted in at least $1 billion in damages. These disasters caused at least 568 direct or indirect fatalities. In the last 45 years, it has been estimated that the cost in damages due to these extreme weather events has been approximately $182.7 billion.

Climate change heightens the risks of wildfires, tornadoes, hail and other natural disasters. As a result, companies no longer make a profit from the policies that they sell so they are now passing down the bill to consumers. This problem is being exacerbated by the passing of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

The bill was passed on July 4, with major cuts seen in important policies that would have supported wind and solar power and clean energy services that could help diminish such catastrophic disasters. Rather than investing in the well-being of the working class and the future of our planet, this new bill will boost the use of fossil fuels and dismantle much of the progress that has been made in order to fight climate change. The bill essentially gives the oil industry everything that it wants including opening up federal lands to drilling and making it cheaper to operate there. Trump has also made it harder for climate change to be taken seriously by appointing three climate skeptics — John Christy, Roy Spencer and Steven E. Koonin to advisory roles in the Department of Energy.

Who are these climate contrarians?

John Christy and Roy Spencer are both research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and Steven E. Koonin is a researcher at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. Koonin previously served at the Department of Energy under the Obama administration and was also a scientist for BP, an oil and gas company. Koonin, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science finds during the first Trump administration, but was ultimately overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time. The “red team” debate would have essentially been a platform where conservative groups could push back on mainstream climate science and challenge the prevailing scientific consensus about humans’ impact on climate change.

Christy and Spencer have long maintained that satellite data does not show the same trends and extent of global warming as surface weather data. They have used this to discredit mainstream scientific data. Many in the scientific community have rebutted the message that these “experts” have put out. Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University stated, “Hiring Koonin, Spencer, and Cristy is not just irregular, it’s a recognition that none of the normal channels would give them the answer they want. This seems to be a thread running through this administration. They don’t seek legitimate expert opinion; instead, they find people to give them the answer they want.”

The Trump administration’s billionaire agenda is invested in climate denialism because the capitalist class cannot see beyond this quarter’s profits. Making the changes required to address the climate crisis would cut into their profits right now. Instead they are focused on rolling back climate and other environmental protections to assure the unfettered flow of wealth into their coffers.

What needs to be done?

Climate change is accelerating and the end of the window to avoid catastrophic consequences is rapidly approaching. Scientific research shows it’s not too late to implement large-scale measures to stop and even reverse climate change if society acts now. The obstacle to implementing these measures is the chokehold on political and economic power held by the capitalist class, which is willfully focused on short term profits over the long term survival of life on this planet.

Even the issue of insurance premiums would be addressed if we had a government that put people’s needs first. Much could be done to prevent storm damage, for instance, by requiring residences to be built to climate resilient standards while retrofitting existing homes. Repairing damage after storms would be a guaranteed right along with the right to a home. Parasitic insurance companies need to go extinct, not the human species! The question before us is how to organize and win political and economic power for the working class to create a government that can implement these necessary changes.

The U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said in April that the country’s reliance on fossil fuels meant “markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed” after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
U.K. oil and gas production is set to decline in the coming decades if the government does not plan to approve new licenses.","Since the Labour Party came into power in the U.K. two years ago, the government has introduced stricter regulations on fossil fuels in a bid to shift to green energy. This has resulted in an uncertain investor environment in Britain’s North Sea, as many energy companies instead invest in renewable energy projects. It has also spurred higher levels of gas imports, and, in recent weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump said he thought the U.K. should backtrack on its green transition in favour of fossil fuels.

In June, the U.K. Labour government introduced stricter environmental rules for fossil fuel projects, which are expected to affect two North Sea oil and gas fields operated by Shell and Equinor. The move means approval for new projects must account for the environmental impact of emissions from using or burning the fuels extracted, also known as downstream emissions. The U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said this “will ensure the full effects of fossil fuel extraction on the environment are recognised in consenting decisions.”

This follows several blows to oil and gas projects in recent years. For example, in January, a Scottish court ruled that the approval of Shell's Jackdaw and Equinor and Ithaca Energy’s Rosebank were unlawful, and the projects must be reassessed. The oil majors are expected to submit new assessments based on the current environmental guidelines. While the government said last year that it would not issue any new oil and gas licences, it also decided it would not revoke any licenses granted by the previous government.

While the new regulations are stricter than previously, they could provide the basis needed for Shell and Equinor to complete the assessments required to get the green light for their projects, by evaluating the full scope of carbon emissions they would produce. Decisions on the two projects are expected to be made by the Autumn or later.

Equinor responded to the new rules, saying, “We are currently reviewing today’s announcement. We remain committed to working closely with all relevant stakeholders to advance the Rosebank project.” The company added, “We welcome clarity and can confirm that we will submit a downstream end user combustion emissions assessment in full compliance with the government’s new environmental guidance.”

Some suggest that higher taxes and stricter limits on North Sea drilling could prevent the U.K. from tapping into its full fossil fuel production potential. Upon taking office, Prime Minister Kier Starmer increased the tax rate on profits from oil and gas extraction to 78 percent. While oil and gas output is expected to rise this year and next as Shell’s Penguins oil field and BP’s Murlach oil field come online, this follows a decline of 11 percent in 2023 and 2024, with crude output averaging 564,000 bpd last year. The industry association Offshore Energies U.K. stated, “Operators overwhelmingly view the UK continental shelf as uncompetitive for investment ... especially compared to overseas opportunities [and] in comparison to offshore wind and carbon capture and storage.”

The U.K.’s gas import dependency is expected to rise from 55 percent at present to 68 percent in 2030, 85 percent in 2040 and 94 percent in 2050, even if new oilfields are approved, as Britain has already used most of the gas in the declining basin.

In a recent visit to Scotland, U.S. President Trump attacked the country’s growing wind power industry and called on the government to produce more fossil fuels, calling the North Sea a “treasure chest” that the U.K. was missing out on because of high taxes. Following the visit, he wrote on Truth Social, U.K. government ministers have “essentially told drillers and oil companies that, ‘we don’t want you.’ Incentivise the drillers, FAST. A VAST FORTUNE TO BE MADE for the U.K., and far lower energy costs for the people!”

However, the Labour government has repeatedly doubled down on its aims for a green transition. The U.K. Energy Minister Ed Miliband said in April that the country’s reliance on fossil fuels meant “markets went into meltdown and prices rocketed” after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. He added, “The cost-of-living impacts caused back then still stalk families today… So, the argument for the clean energy transition is not just the traditional climate case but the social justice case too – it is working people who pay the greatest price for our energy insecurity.”

Miliband warned that an anti-net-zero agenda would not only risk “climate breakdown” but would “forfeit the clean energy jobs of the future,” while a green power transition will help secure social justice and national security.

U.K. oil and gas production is set to decline in the coming decades if the government does not plan to approve new licenses. Meanwhile, the country’s renewable energy and nuclear power output is expected to increase significantly as the government finances a green transition and encourages private investors to do the same. It seems like the U.K. is now finally on the track that the U.S. started on under President Biden, before Trump backtracked on a plethora of favourable climate policies.

The union, which represents 8,000 EPA employees, is planning a legal response to the decision, said Mr Justin Chen, president of the agency’s chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, in a statement on Aug 8.

The decision gets Mr Trump closer to his goal to strip hundreds of thousands of federal workers of the ability to collectively bargain with US agencies.

Eliminating union deals would allow agencies to more easily fire or discipline employees, according to attorneys representing federal workers.

“EPA is working to diligently implement President Trump’s Executive Orders with respect to AFGE, including ‘Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs’, in compliance with the law,” an EPA spokesperson said in a statement, referring to the executive order Mr Trump issued in March.

The order involves removing collective bargaining rights at more than 30 federal agencies, including the EPA, and is currently being challenged in court by unions who say it violates free speech and obligations to bargain with workers.

The EPA had more than 16,000 employees as of March 2025, according to federal HR records. That figure does not include employees that accepted buyouts.

The agency said in July it would cut the size of its workforce by at least 23 per cent and close its scientific research office as part of Mr Trump’s

broad effort to downsize the federal government.

By selectively vetoing 63 provisions of the controversial “Devastation Bill,” Lula has struck a delicate balance between economic ambition and environmental preservation. This recalibration not only addresses global climate commitments but also creates a more predictable framework for investors seeking to capitalize on Brazil's vast natural resources.

Lula's Vetoes: A Calculated Compromise

The original bill, backed by agribusiness lobbies, sought to streamline licensing by allowing self-declared permits for “medium-impact” projects and sidelining Indigenous communities from decision-making. Lula's vetoes, however, preserved rigorous oversight for strategic projects, reinstated Indigenous consultation rights, and introduced a “Special Environmental License” to fast-track critical infrastructure without compromising ecological safeguards. Of the 63 rejected provisions, 26 were struck down outright, while 37 were revised to align with Brazil's 2030 deforestation and emissions targets.

This approach has been lauded by environmentalists and NGOs, who argue it prevents a “death blow” to the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. Yet, it also retains enough flexibility to attract capital. For instance, the government's push to fast-track lithium and rare earths projects in Minas Gerais and the Amazon basin aligns with global demand for clean energy materials. The BNDES Strategic Minerals Investment Fund, a $200 million initiative, further de-risks projects for private investors, while the public tender system has already drawn 7x more applications than previous methods.

Mining and Energy: A Dual-Track Opportunity

Brazil's mining sector is now a linchpin of its energy transition strategy. In Q3 2024, mineral exports surged to $11.18 billion, with iron ore (70.1%), copper (9.3%), and gold (8.5%) leading the charge. The National Mining Agency (ANM) has streamlined 70,000 pending licenses, creating a pipeline of ready-to-develop projects. Meanwhile, lithium production is accelerating: 11 projects in Minas Gerais are expected to attract $2.8 billion in investment by 2030, with AMG Brazil's $250 million lithium carbonate plant set to reduce reliance on Chinese processing.

Energy infrastructure is equally promising. The government's “Special Environmental License” could expedite oil exploration at the Amazon's mouth, while the National Energy Transition Policy (PNTE) aims to integrate renewables into Brazil's energy matrix. Strategic partnerships with the U.S. (via the Inflation Reduction Act) and the EU (through technology transfers) are opening new markets for Brazilian minerals, positioning the country as a critical node in global supply chains.

Navigating Risks and Rewards

While the reforms reduce regulatory uncertainty, challenges remain. Conservative lawmakers in Congress may attempt to override Lula's vetoes, potentially triggering legal battles. Environmental groups, though satisfied with the vetoes, remain vigilant, warning that weakened provisions could still lead to deforestation and pollution. Investors must also weigh the political risks of a polarized Congress and the reputational costs of projects near Indigenous lands.

However, the upside is compelling. Brazil's lithium reserves, coupled with its strategic location in the “Lithium Valley,” offer a unique opportunity to supply the EV and battery industries. Similarly, the government's focus on rare earths—critical for green technologies—could unlock value as global demand outpaces supply. For infrastructure, the fast-tracking of strategic projects (e.g., transmission lines, ports) will require $150 billion in investment by 2030, per the World Bank.

Strategic Entry for Investors

The window to act is narrowing. With the 2025 UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Belém approaching, Brazil's environmental policies will face global scrutiny. Investors who align with the government's “neoindustrialization” agenda—focusing on ESG-compliant projects and partnerships with state agencies—stand to benefit from first-mover advantages.

Consider the following opportunities:

1. Lithium and Rare Earths Producers: Companies like AMG Brazil and Anglo American's Minas Gerais ventures.

2. Infrastructure Developers: Firms involved in renewable energy transmission or port expansions.

3. ESG-Focused Funds: Those targeting Brazil's green bonds or sustainable mining ventures.

Conclusion: A Market at the Crossroads

Brazil's revised licensing framework is a masterstroke of political pragmatism. By preserving environmental integrity while accelerating resource development, Lula has created a regulatory environment that appeals to both global climate goals and investor appetites. For those willing to navigate the political and ecological nuances, Brazil's mining and energy sectors represent a high-conviction opportunity in a market poised for transformation. The question is no longer whether Brazil can balance growth and sustainability—it's whether investors can act swiftly enough to secure their stake in this evolving landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 03:58:02.312437

The Environmental Protection Agency is weighing the termination of its $7 billion Solar For All program, a move that would strip Nevada of millions of dollars in federal funding for residential solar development.

Last year, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — was awarded a $156 million grant under the Solar for All program to finance community solar projects that would benefit low-income households.

Now that funding is jeopardized by the Trump administration’s proposal to axe the Biden-era program created under the Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 law that dedicated nearly $370 billion to the clean energy transition.

In a statement, an EPA spokesperson said the agency is “working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law” after the passage of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” last month.

The tax and spending bill eliminated the IRA’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund – which finances the Solar for All grant – and scrapped all unobligated money under the fund. Nevada’s Solar for All funds have already been contractually obligated, which could make terminating the states’ grant more difficult.

Solar for All is the only surviving grant under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund after EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants in March.

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund said it has not received a Solar for All termination notice as of Wednesday. The nonprofit is still accepting applications, and encourages anyone interested in the program to apply.

“We hear from Nevadans every day that they desperately need the relief that comes from our Nevada Solar for All program, and we have been working hard over the past year to get these funds into the hands of the households that need them,” said Kirsten Stasio, CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.

Nevada has been racing to get money out the door after funding for the program was frozen in February as the result of an executive order from President Donald Trump. The EPA unfroze those funds the following month in response to court orders.

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund selected its first project under the program last month, which would provide low-cost solar power for The Empowerment Center’s new sober living facility in Reno.

“We received a Nevada Solar for All investment that is transformational for our organization and the women we serve,” said Roxanne DeCarlo, executive director of The Empowerment Center, which helps low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse.

“Lower energy costs mean we can focus more resources on what matters most: helping women rebuild their lives in a safe, stable environment,” DeCarlo said.

Nevada is one of 60 grant recipients, including 49 state agencies, that could lose millions in federal funding if the program is successfully terminated.

Nevada was awarded the largest Solar for All grant per capita of any state. Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.

If terminated, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund said the state could lose high paying jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in additional private investment.

Mark Dickson, president of Simple Power Solar, called Nevada’s Solar for All program “a critical stabilizer” for the solar industry as it navigates difficult economic headwinds.

“Our workforce of over 35 employees, along with thousands of others from dozens of other companies statewide, rely on the continued support and demand generated by this program,” Dickson said.

Nevada’s solar industry is already facing strain after Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy last month, including tax credits that fueled solar development.

Under the tax and spending bill, solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 will not be eligible for the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit — phasing out the credit six years ahead of schedule. If those projects are not in service by the end of 2027 they also won’t get the full credit. The 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.

The loss of the residential solar credit is “already disrupting clean energy businesses,” said Steve Hamile, the CEO of Sol-Up, the company slated to install the Empowerment Center’s solar project.

“Sol-Up employs nearly 200 people, and the stability and demand from this program are important for sustaining our workforce,” Hamile said.

The early termination of solar tax credits would likely require the Nevada Clean Energy Fund to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects, said Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.

Nevada’s Clean Energy Fund already lost a $20 million grant from the EPA in May that would have funded the construction of critical water and energy infrastructure on the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Northern Nevada.

Solar for All funds were expected to lower energy costs by at least 20% for more than 50,000 low-income and disadvantaged households in Nevada by 2029.

Without the program, low-income households will be left with fewer options to address rising energy costs, said Beth Dunning, the director of community development at Nevada Rural Housing.

“Nevada Solar for All will lower electricity bills for many rural families who otherwise would be unable to access these savings and increase energy reliability in rural and remote communities that face frequent power outages,” Dunning said.",https://cdn.thisisreno.com/conradcomm/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-photo-356049.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 20:58:56.962037

Reporting from Peru

Each morning, Rosa Chamami wakes to flames licking at cardboard scraps in a makeshift stove in her yard.

The boxes she brought home once held 800,000 high-tech solar panels. Now, they fuel her fire.

Between 2018 and 2024, those panels were installed at Rubí and Clemesí, two massive solar plants in Peru's Moquegua region, about 1,000 kilometres south of the capital, Lima. Together, they form the country's largest solar complex – and one of the biggest in Latin America.

From her home in the small settlement of Pampa Clemesí, Rosa can see the rows of panels glowing under white floodlights. The Rubí plant is just 600 metres away.

Yet her home – and the rest of her village – remains in total darkness, unconnected to the grid the plant feeds into.

Power from the sun, but not at home

None of Pampa Clemesí's 150 residents have access to the national power grid.

A few have solar panels donated by Rubí's operator, Orygen, but most can't afford the batteries and converters needed to make them work. At night, they use torches – or simply live in the dark.

The paradox is striking: the Rubí solar power plant produces around 440 GWh a year, enough to supply electricity to 351,000 homes. Moquegua, where the plant is located, is an ideal site for solar energy, receiving over 3,200 hours of sunshine annually, more than most countries.

And that contradiction becomes even sharper in a country currently experiencing a renewable energy boom.

In 2024 alone, electricity generation from renewables grew by 96%. Solar and wind power depend heavily on copper due to its high conductivity – and Peru is the world's second-largest producer.

""In Peru, the system was designed around profitability. No effort was made to connect sparsely populated areas,"" explains Carlos Gordillo, an energy expert at the University of Santa María in Arequipa.

Orygen says it has fulfilled its responsabilities.

""We've joined the government project to bring electricity to Pampa Clemesí and have already built a dedicated line for them. We also completed the first phase of the electrification project, with 53 power towers ready to operate,"" Marco Fragale, Orygen's executive director in Peru, told BBC News Mundo, the BBC's Spanish-language service.

Fragale adds that nearly 4,000 metres of underground cable were installed to provide a power line for the village. The $800,000 investment is complete, he says.

But the lights still haven't come on.

The final step – connecting the new line to individual homes – is the government's responsibility. According to the plan, the Ministry of Mines and Energy must lay about two kilometres of wiring. Work was slated to begin in March 2025, but hasn't started.

BBC News Mundo tried to contact the Ministry of Mines and Energy but received no response.

A daily struggle for basics

Rosa's tiny house has no sockets.

Each day, she walks around the village, hoping someone can spare a bit of electricity to charge her phone.

""It's essential,"" she says, explaining she needs the device to stay in touch with her family near the border with Bolivia.

One of the few people who can help is Rubén Pongo. In his larger home – with patios and several rooms – a group of speckled hens fights for rooftop space between the solar panels.

""The company donated solar panels to most villagers,"" he says. ""But I had to buy the battery, the converter, and the cables myself – and pay for installation.""

Rubén owns something others only dream of: a fridge. But it only runs for up to 10 hours a day, and on cloudy days, not at all.

He helped build the Rubí plant and later worked in maintenance, cleaning the panels. Today, he manages the warehouse and is driven to work by the company, even though the plant is just across the road.

Crossing the Pan-American Highway on foot is prohibited by Peruvian law.

From his rooftop, Rubén points to a cluster of glowing buildings in the distance.

""That's the plant's substation,"" he says. ""It looks like a little lit-up town.""

A long wait

Residents began settling in Pampa Clemesí in the early 2000s. Among them is Pedro Chará, now 70. He's watched the 500,000-panel Rubí plant rise almost on his doorstep.

Much of the village is built from discarded materials from the plant. Pedro says even their beds come from scrap wood.

There's no water system, no sewage, no rubbish collection. The village once had 500 residents, but due to scarce infrastructure, the majority left – especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Sometimes, after waiting so long, fighting for water and electricity, you just feel like dying. That's it. Dying,"" he says.

Dinner by torchlight

Rosa hurries to her aunt's house, hoping to catch the last of the daylight. Tonight, she's cooking dinner for a small group of neighbours who share meals.

In the kitchen, a gas stove heats a kettle. Their only light is a solar-powered torch. Dinner is sweet tea and fried dough.

""We eat only what we can keep at room temperature,"" says Rosa.

Without refrigeration, protein-rich foods are hard to store.

Fresh produce requires a 40-minute bus ride to Moquegua – if they can afford it.

""But we don't have money to take the bus every day.""

With no electricity, many in Latin America cook with firewood or kerosene, risking respiratory illness.

In Pampa Clemesí, residents use gas when they can afford it — wood when they can't.

They pray by torchlight for food, shelter, and water, then eat in silence. It's 7pm, their final activity. No phones. No TV.

""Our only light is these little torches,"" Rosa says. ""They don't show much, but at least we can see the bed.""

""If we had electricity, people would come back,"" Pedro says. ""We stayed because we had no choice. But with light, we could build a future.""

A soft breeze stirs the desert streets, lifting sand. A layer of dust settles on the lampposts on the main plaza, waiting to be installed. The wind signals that dusk is coming – and that soon, there will be no light.

For those without solar panels, like Rosa and Pedro, the darkness stretches on until sunrise. So does their hope that the government will one day act.

Like so many nights before, they prepare for another evening without light.

But why do they still live here?

""Because of the sun,"" Rosa replies without hesitation.

""Here, we always have the sun.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eecd/live/06dbdfb0-617b-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:58:48.877582

Comparing 1970s climate predictions to modern climate science is like comparing a horse and buggy to an electric vehicle.","The Gateway, Black Canyon, and Meeker fires burning across our region are just part of a nationwide crisis: Communities from California to Florida are grappling with extreme heat, flooding, and hazardous air from fires intensified by warming temperatures and prolonged drought. These aren’t abstract future threats; they’re today’s reality here on the Western Slope and across our nation.

The science Is overwhelming

Walcher characterizes the EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding as “controversial,” but this framing ignores scientific reality. A comprehensive 2021 study in Environmental Research Letters analyzed over 88,000 peer-reviewed climate studies published between 2012-2020. The result? 99.9% of climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and is primarily caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuels. Only 28 studies — all published in minor journals — expressed any skepticism.

This isn’t a matter of opinion or political preference. It’s established science, as solid as our understanding of gravity or the link between smoking and cancer.

The real economic threat is climate inaction

While Walcher focuses on the costs of regulating pollution, he ignores the staggering price of inaction. Colorado has endured billions of dollars in wildfire damage, agricultural losses from persistent drought, and infrastructure destruction from extreme weather. The 2021 Marshall Fire in Boulder — the most destructive in state history — caused over $2 billion in damages in a single day. The economic toll from our current regional fires is still being calculated, but the emotional toll on affected communities is already immeasurable.

Nationally, climate disasters cost $165 billion in 2022 alone, and these costs are accelerating. Meanwhile, the clean energy transition has become an economic driver. Colorado’s renewable energy sector employs over 67,000 people, often at wages exceeding traditional energy jobs.

Rather than asking what climate action costs, we should ask what prosperity looks like in a stable climate versus an unstable one.

Misleading historical comparisons

Walcher attempts to undermine climate science by citing decades-old predictions about food shortages and global cooling. This comparison is profoundly misleading. Those earlier predictions were based on limited data and primitive models, often by individual researchers.

Today’s climate science represents the largest scientific collaboration in human history, involving thousands of researchers across dozens of countries, sophisticated computer models, satellite data, and multiple lines of converging evidence. Comparing 1970s climate predictions to modern climate science is like comparing a horse and buggy to an electric vehicle.

Walcher also mischaracterizes CO2 as simply “a naturally occurring compound vital to life.” While CO2 is indeed naturally present in our atmosphere, he misses the fundamental issue: CO2 is the primary driver of the greenhouse effect that warms our planet. Atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 parts per million before industrialization to over 425 ppm today — a 50% increase in just 150 years. As with any essential substance, the dose makes the poison.

A path forward

Rather than relitigating settled science, we should focus on solutions that protect both our economy and environment. Colorado has proven this is possible, reducing emissions while maintaining economic growth. We need policies that deliver dependable, affordable energy by accelerating the clean energy transition, support communities affected by extreme weather, and prepare for unavoidable climate impacts. Reversing the EPA’s Endangerment Finding will achieve none of this — it will only delay necessary action while costs mount.

The debate Walcher calls for has already happened — in peer-reviewed journals, scientific conferences, and research institutions worldwide. The verdict is clear: Climate change is real, human-caused, and requires urgent action.

Looking across our smoke-filled valley, I don’t need more debate about whether climate change is real. I need leaders who will act on the science to protect our communities and our children’s future. I hope you will join me in asking Rep. Jeff Hurd and Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper to support science-based climate policies that serve Colorado’s interests.

Under new mandates proposed by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), beginning in 2028, a total of 1% of America’s LNG exports must be carried via U.S.-flagged vessels. From 2029 onwards, 1% of U.S. LNG exports should be shipped on U.S.-flagged and U.S.-built vessels.

This number will gradually rise over the decades, and by 2047, a total of 15% of all U.S. LNG exports should be carried on U.S.-built U.S.-flagged LNG tankers.

Just 1% of exports may look like a negligible figure if one doesn’t consider that the United States is the world’s largest LNG exporter, the current operational global LNG fleet has just one U.S.-flagged vessel (but built in France), and that building an LNG tanker in the United States will take years and probably cost two to four times the price of building a vessel in South Korea or China.

It is countering China’s dominance and reviving America’s shipbuilding that’s the key goal of the proposed USTR rules.

However, energy industry groups and analysts say the mandate would harm U.S. LNG exports more than it would crimp China’s dominance.

The oil and LNG lobby groups are calling on the USTR to scrap the provision for LNG tankers, as compliance with the mandate is impossible.

The Center for Liquefied Natural Gas (CLNG), the U.S. trade association promoting LNG exports and including LNG exporters and project developers, says that compliance with the USTR mandate is impossible as “There are currently no U.S.-made or enough U.S.- flagged vessels capable of exporting the quantity of LNG necessary to support current or increased U.S. LNG exports.”

The U.S. does not have the shipyard capacity, technical capability, or supply chains to significantly ramp up shipbuilding of U.S. LNG carriers to meet the USTR requirements. In addition, the U.S. currently lacks the highly specialized and skilled crews for the operation and maintenance of LNG ships, CLNG said.

The U.S. exported a total of 1,396 LNG cargoes last year. At the same time, the global LNG vessel fleet has 792 operating tankers, per data cited by the CLNG trade association. Of these, only one is a U.S.-flagged ship, but it is half the capacity of a modern LNG carrier and primarily serves to deliver LNG to Puerto Rico.

CLNG and the American Petroleum Institute (API) last month jointly filed comments on the proposed USTR mandates, saying that the restrictions on LNG shipping do not directly address China’s unfair practices and “instead penalize U.S. LNG exporters.”

The requirement “is unrealistic and will continue to disproportionately impact the U.S. LNG industry and not Chinese entities,” API and CLNG said.

Last year, about 1,400 cargoes of U.S. LNG were delivered to buyers around the world, and that number is slated to nearly double by the end of the decade as terminals that are currently under construction enter service, the associations said.

Under USTR’s requirements for 1% of U.S. LNG exports starting in 2029 to be transported on U.S.-built vessels, as many as six U.S.-built LNG vessels would be required by the end of the decade, which is not feasible.

The U.S. built its last LNG carrier in 1980.

Moreover, the groups note that there is a limited ability to access key shipbuilding components and build LNG vessels in the U.S., while the United States lacks the skilled labor necessary to build LNG carriers and probably a more daunting challenge of crewing and manning these vessels, API and CLNG said.

Analysts say the industry needs clarity on what would constitute a U.S.-built vessel.

“Could the majority of the vessel be manufactured overseas and completed in the U.S.? Is it a U.S.-made engine?” Jason Feer, global head of business intelligence for Poten & Partners, told CNBC.

Other experts say that the mandate, if it stays, will require flexibility in interpretation of what constitutes a U.S.-built ship and waivers for the industry if the Trump Administration wants its American LNG export dominance to succeed.

“Without some common-sense flexibility or a phased-in approach, the math just doesn’t add up,” Louis Sola, a former commissioner at the Federal Maritime Commission appointed by President Trump, and now a partner at lobbying firm Thorn Run Partners, told CNBC.

“We risk bottling up our own LNG exports and opening the market to the competition right when our allies need American energy the most.”

With rising gas prices and the growing popularity of electric vehicles, many drivers are wondering if switching to a Tesla makes financial sense compared to sticking with a reliable gas-powered SUV like the Subaru Forester.

The monthly fuel costs reveal a clear winner.

Tesla Monthly Charging Costs

Based on available data, Tesla owners can expect varying monthly charging costs depending on their driving habits and local electricity rates. Using the average charging cost of 4.56 cents per mile and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to approximately $50 per month for home charging. For comparison, charging exclusively at home could increase your electric bill by $50-$100 monthly, according to GOBankingRates.

Subaru Forester Monthly Gas Costs

The 2025 Subaru Forester achieves 29 MPG combined (26 city in the city, 33 on highway), according to Edmunds. Using current national gas prices of approximately $3.20 per gallon and typical monthly driving of 1,100 miles, this calculates to about $122 per month in fuel costs for Forester owners.

The Cost Comparison

Based on these calculations, Tesla owners spend roughly $50 monthly on electricity, while Forester drivers pay about $122 for gas. This represents potential monthly savings of approximately $72 when choosing Tesla over the Subaru Forester.

Over a year, Tesla drivers could save around $864 compared to Forester owners, assuming consistent home charging for Tesla and regular gas prices for the Forester.

Additional Considerations

However, the comparison isn’t purely about fuel costs. Charging at Tesla Supercharger stations costs about 25 cents per kWh, meaning a full recharge to 250 miles would cost about $22, which is more expensive than home charging but still competitive with gas prices.

Tesla’s lower operating costs extend beyond fuel savings, including reduced maintenance requirements compared to traditional gas engines. Meanwhile, the Forester offers advantages like lower upfront costs, established service networks, and no range anxiety.

For budget-conscious drivers prioritizing monthly fuel expenses, Tesla provides significant savings over the Subaru Forester based on these calculations, making electric vehicle ownership increasingly attractive from a purely operational cost perspective.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/shutterstock_editorial_12587099d-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 02:06:47.832120

The Solar for All program is the only nationwide initiative dedicated to delivering solar access to low-income communities, with goals of

Saving low income-households $400 a year on their electricity bills

Creating more than 200,000 jobs, many in the very communities the program aimed to serve

Countries that lead that revolution and successfully harness the vast potential of green energy technology will reap the benefits.

By taking a sledgehammer to the burgeoning domestic green energy economy, with all of its innovation and jobs, President Donald Trump threatens to put this country at an enormous disadvantage when America could, and should, be leading the way.

That matters a great deal in Virginia, where expanding wind and solar is a priority and where the effects of a warming planet and a changing climate pose an increasing problem to residents. It’s why the commonwealth needs its officials, both state and federal, to oppose White House policies that promise to hold America back.

Some 27 miles from the Virginia Beach Oceanfront, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project continues to take shape. Since the two test turbines began operating in 2020, work has expanded as the company seeks to build 174 additional turbines, generating enough energy to power up to 660,000 homes.

When completed, it will be the largest offshore wind farm in the United States. That status has helped expand the green energy sector in the region, as companies and academic institutions pivot toward jobs and training to support renewable development and growth. Dominion has estimated the project will support 1,100 jobs and result in more than $143 million of annual economic output and $57 million in annual wages and benefits.

Green energy development accelerated under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which the General Assembly passed in 2020. It sets a goal of generating 100% of the commonwealth’s power by renewable sources by 2050, an ambitious goal that has been complicated by the commonwealth’s growing demand for power — driven, in large part, by the proliferation of data centers, which are voracious energy consumers.

Virginia Republicans almost uniformly oppose the VCEA, calling it impractical, unreliable and too costly. But even Gov. Glenn Youngkin recognizes the value of expanding renewable energy sources, as reflected in his “all-of-the-above” energy plan released in 2022.

While the governor’s plan called for changes to the VCEA and urged continued reliance on fossil fuels such as natural gas, it also notes that Virginia “can benefit from increased wind generation” and that “solar also offers an opportunity for Virginia to become a leader.”

VCEA supporters may criticize the Youngkin administration’s conclusions, but should appreciate the governor’s recognition that undercutting the growth of renewable development would be unnecessary and harmful to the commonwealth.

The president could learn a thing or two from that approach.

Trump unabashedly favored oil and gas interests during his first term, and his second term has already featured much of the same. That’s no surprise given that, as a candidate, he pressured oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign.

But even industry insiders didn’t expect the second Trump administration to seek the total destruction of wind and solar development and deployment. One of his first acts was to freeze leases for renewable development and halt permitting for new projects. He subsequently directed the Interior Department to conduct new reviews of approved projects, withdrew leases for offshore development and has made the permitting process cumbersome enough to discourage companies from pursuing renewable development.

Add to that provisions in the recently approved spending bill, which saw Republican lawmakers cancel most Biden-era green-energy tax credits, and the environment has never been more hostile to energy alternatives.

These are self-inflicted wounds and indefensible decisions given the emphasis China, among others, has placed on being a leader in this sector.

State and federal officials from Virginia should be among those urging the continued development of renewable energy, understanding it will shape the future of our nation and the commonwealth.","Transitioning the nation’s energy supply from a reliance on fossil fuels such as coal and gas to cleaner, renewable sources such as solar and wind is the challenge of our modern age, as well as its most exciting opportunity. Countries that lead that revolution and successfully harness the vast potential of green energy technology will reap the benefits.

By taking a sledgehammer to the burgeoning domestic green energy economy, with all of its innovation and jobs, President Donald Trump threatens to put this country at an enormous disadvantage when America could, and should, be leading the way.

That matters a great deal in Virginia, where expanding wind and solar is a priority and where the effects of a warming planet and a changing climate pose an increasing problem to residents. It’s why the commonwealth needs its officials, both state and federal, to oppose White House policies that promise to hold America back.

Some 27 miles from the Virginia Beach Oceanfront, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project continues to take shape. Since the two test turbines began operating in 2020, work has expanded as the company seeks to build 174 additional turbines, generating enough energy to power up to 660,000 homes.

When completed, it will be the largest offshore wind farm in the United States. That status has helped expand the green energy sector in the region, as companies and academic institutions pivot toward jobs and training to support renewable development and growth. Dominion has estimated the project will support 1,100 jobs and result in more than $143 million of annual economic output and $57 million in annual wages and benefits.

Green energy development accelerated under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which the General Assembly passed in 2020. It sets a goal of generating 100% of the commonwealth’s power by renewable sources by 2050, an ambitious goal that has been complicated by the commonwealth’s growing demand for power — driven, in large part, by the proliferation of data centers, which are voracious energy consumers.

Virginia Republicans almost uniformly oppose the VCEA, calling it impractical, unreliable and too costly. But even Gov. Glenn Youngkin recognizes the value of expanding renewable energy sources, as reflected in his “all-of-the-above” energy plan released in 2022.

While the governor’s plan called for changes to the VCEA and urged continued reliance on fossil fuels such as natural gas, it also notes that Virginia “can benefit from increased wind generation” and that “solar also offers an opportunity for Virginia to become a leader.”

VCEA supporters may criticize the Youngkin administration’s conclusions, but should appreciate the governor’s recognition that undercutting the growth of renewable development would be unnecessary and harmful to the commonwealth.

The president could learn a thing or two from that approach.

Trump unabashedly favored oil and gas interests during his first term, and his second term has already featured much of the same. That’s no surprise given that, as a candidate, he pressured oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign.

But even industry insiders didn’t expect the second Trump administration to seek the total destruction of wind and solar development and deployment. One of his first acts was to freeze leases for renewable development and halt permitting for new projects. He subsequently directed the Interior Department to conduct new reviews of approved projects, withdrew leases for offshore development and has made the permitting process cumbersome enough to discourage companies from pursuing renewable development.

Add to that provisions in the recently approved spending bill, which saw Republican lawmakers cancel most Biden-era green-energy tax credits, and the environment has never been more hostile to energy alternatives.

These are self-inflicted wounds and indefensible decisions given the emphasis China, among others, has placed on being a leader in this sector. State and federal officials from Virginia should be among those urging the continued development of renewable energy, understanding it will shape the future of our nation and the commonwealth.",https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/TVP-L-NW-DOMINION-WIND-TURBINES-0717-KW-02.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-09 20:07:47.143268

The Solterra was Subaru's first battery-powered vehicle after a long history of customer loyalty with internal combustion engine vehicles, commonly known as gas-powered. According to Inside EVs, more than 21,000 Solterras were sold last year, and, in 2025 alone, sales are already up by 21%. Subaru's investment in electric is paying off — and they're not slowing down.

""The Uncharted is Subaru's fashionable new EV with 300+ miles of range and a feature-packed cabin,"" reported Inside EVs. The Uncharted is most similar to the Crosstrek hatchback, and maintains what makes that car so popular: its spaciousness, off-road capabilities, and versatility.

According to Inside EVs, the vehicle will be available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. ""The FWD will get more than 300 miles of Subaru-estimated range with 221 horsepower. The AWD will have identical output as the C-HR: 290 miles of range and 338 horsepower. Its 0-60 miles per hour acceleration time will be less than five seconds,"" explained Inside EVs.

Subaru is smart to capitalize on the massive potential of electric vehicles. Public opinion on EVs is slowly changing for the better, especially as common myths about EVs — like range anxiety, battery waste, and mineral mining — are dispelled.

The manufacturing process for all cars emits carbon, whether by digging minerals out of the earth for the battery, or shipping the car from international factories. However, after just 13,500 miles of emissions-free driving, a workhorse EV like Tesla's Model 3 has completely neutralized the environmental costs associated with its manufacturing.

Although we haven't moved entirely away from dirty electricity yet, we do know that even when EVs are charged with a typical combination of power sources — like sun, wind, and coal — they are still far cleaner than gas-powered cars. One study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that gas cars create an average of 350 grams of carbon air pollution per mile driven over their lifetimes, and this value was only 200 for EVs that operate on batteries charging on an average U.S. power grid.

Many EV owners opt out of dirty energy completely and install solar panels to save even more money and make their EV charging completely carbon-neutral. EnergySage has an easy-to-use tool for comparing quotes from vetted local solar installers, whether you're just curious or ready to buy. EnergySage can help you identify any local or federal tax credits and save up to $10,000 on solar installations.

A significant lithium deposit has been unearthed in the Jijiaoshan mining area, Linwu County. As the world electrifies and competition for energy transition metals intensifies, this find further solidifies China’s dominant position in the battery value chain. This discovery comes at a time when the demand for lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, is soaring. With China already holding a substantial share of the world’s lithium reserves, this discovery could reinforce its strategic advantage.

The Enormous Deposit and Its Strategic Location

Local authorities and scientists from the Hunan Mineral Resources Research Institute have reported that the deposit contains nearly 490 million tons of rock with lithium, equating to approximately 1.31 million tons of lithium oxide. This wealth is embedded in altered granite—a geological structure well-known for favorable extraction conditions. Unlike brine deposits, which are more complex and slower to exploit, hard rock allows for more straightforward separation and processing methods.

This type of deposit offers another advantage: it is often multimetal-rich. In addition to lithium, geologists have identified other strategically important metals such as tungsten, tin, and rubidium. Rubidium, a rare element, is highly valued for atomic clocks and emerging photovoltaic technologies. These additional resources could prove invaluable as demand for advanced technologies continues to grow.

China’s Pre-existing Strong Position

This discovery does not occur in a strategic void. As of 2024, China already held 16.5% of the world’s lithium reserves, second only to Chile, and more significantly, over 70% of the global refining capacity. This makes China an essential player in transforming raw ore into usable materials for lithium-ion batteries, the technological heart of electric vehicles and stationary storage.

Moreover, Beijing continues to explore its subsurface. Exploration campaigns are underway in a vast spodumene geological belt in Tibet, spanning 2,800 miles. Initial estimates suggest up to 30 million tons of potential lithium. If these figures are confirmed, it could significantly alter the global resource balance, further cementing China’s leading role in the lithium market.

Responding to Explosive Demand

The race for lithium is not accidental. With over 60% of the world’s electric vehicle fleet, China expects its lithium demand to double by 2030, according to projections. It also dominates battery manufacturing, accounting for over three-quarters of global production. In the face of this growth, ensuring a reliable domestic supply has become a strategic priority.

The exploitation of the Jijiaoshan deposit aligns with this strategy: securing resources, accelerating their local processing, and thus enhancing the country’s industrial autonomy. This focus on domestic resources underlines China’s commitment to maintaining its leadership in the burgeoning electric vehicle and renewable energy sectors.

A Context of Global Competition

As geopolitical tensions rise around critical resources, Western countries are attempting to respond. Alliances like the United States-European Union Partnership on Raw Materials aim to reduce dependence on China. However, the gap is significant, particularly in refining and extraction technologies.

Meanwhile, China is advancing its initiatives: public subsidies, comprehensive exploration, and innovations in rare metal extraction processes. Recently, Chinese researchers developed a method to isolate ultra-pure rubidium chloride from low-concentration brines, opening new avenues for exploiting marginal resources. These advancements could further entrench China’s position in the global resource landscape.

A Major Piece on the Energy Chessboard

The discovery at Jijiaoshan is not just an additional deposit. It exemplifies China’s methodical strategy to secure access to the metals of the future. If exploitation proceeds as planned, this reserve could quickly supply the country’s battery factories while strengthening its position in international negotiations.

As the global energy transition relies on limited resources, the rocks of Hunan might play a decisive role. Beneath the granite, China may not have found gold, but something far more valuable for the 21st century. How will the rest of the world respond to this growing dominance in critical raw materials?

Wyoming-based All Solar has seen steadily increasing demand in recent years among homeowners and small businesses seeking some level of “energy independence,” including some clients that might surprise.

“It runs the gamut,” All Solar Head of Operations Riley Pieper told WyoFile, “from Rocky Mountain Power [customers] to people in the oilfield that you wouldn’t really expect. They love their solar equipment.”

The company currently has more than 100 installs scheduled and has been preparing to expand operations in the state and potentially open new branches in Montana and Nebraska. But those ambitions might be on hold for a while, Pieper said.

The long-running 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar will close at the end of this year due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill. A lot of All Solar’s past and prospective clients rely on the tax credit, according to Pieper. When it goes away, “it won’t make as much [economic] sense for a lot of people,” she said. “It is definitely not ideal.”

Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have frozen or cut consumer-level renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as halted permitting for commercial-scale wind and solar projects and gutted research budgets and grant programs for the industries.

Speculation abounds about the actual impacts for Wyoming homeowners and small businesses, as well as commercial wind and solar developers. Not only will the new policy moves take time to play out in the market, but many are likely to be tied up in court challenges, according to sources who spoke with WyoFile.

Rising costs

The stakes are high for a lot of Wyoming households. Many have already seen electric bills increase by double digits, and one analysis predicts the nation’s current policy direction could spike bills here by another 29% over the next decade.

“For low-income residents in particular, they’re just going to be subject to increasing [electric] rates, which is just going to continue to exacerbate as we have data centers coming online and wildfire risk continuing to drive [utilities’] insurance costs to go up,” Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Associate Jonathan Williams told WyoFile, referring to a mounting insurance cost and litigation dilemma for both electric utilities and their customers.

The council has been working for years on another federal program it believes is a particularly good fit in Wyoming, according to Williams.

Solar For All, created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was aimed at helping low- and medium-income households, along with nonprofits and Native American tribes, to pay for solar panel installations. Some $30 million was set aside for qualifying Wyoming applicants, and $5 million of that was set aside for the Wind River Indian Reservation.

But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to cancel some $7 billion in grants already awarded under the program, throwing into doubt Wyoming’s share.

Big Wind Carpenter, a member of the Northern Arapaho tribe, serves as the Outdoor Council’s tribal engagement coordinator. Some workforce training was already underway, they said, and the tribes had identified several housing project facilities as ideal candidates for rooftop solar.

“Putting rooftop solar on those houses would have saved [money for] a lot of people who are already lower-income families,” Big Wind said.

The council estimated that perhaps more than 30% of all Wyoming households might have qualified for assistance under the Solar for All program.

The potential lost opportunity in Wyoming is compounded by the administration putting into limbo more than $50 million for the Home Energy Savings Program to help low-income households cope with rising electric utility rates “and access more reliable energy by providing rebates for home energy efficiency projects,” according to a 2024 state presentation.

“Just across the board, on numerous programs similar to [Solar for All], which is an intent to reduce electricity bills, folks have seen uncertainty and new headwinds that have popped up,” Williams added.

Part of the drive behind the Solar for All program, according to Lander-based Creative Energies co-founder Scott Kane, was in response to the long-running tax credit for rooftop solar and criticism that it too narrowly catered to households that could afford the investment.

“The solar for all program was trying to push the energy transition in our country,” Kane said. “But it was also really motivated by environmental justice. It was really trying to make sure that the benefits of clean energy were accruing to all of society, not just the healthier economic tiers. That’s the thing that hurts so much about the loss of the Solar for All program: They’re pushing solar back to a time when only higher-income families could afford solar.”

Support, criticism for wind and solar

Despite Wyoming’s deep roots in fossil fuels and skepticism of renewables — particularly wind turbines proliferating across the landscape — more residents are warming to renewable energy, especially for powering their homes. Rising electricity rates likely play a big role.

The increasing costs are changing attitudes, Williams suggested, noting that about 70% of Wyoming residents support rooftop solar, citing the University of Wyoming’s 2022 report, Social License for Wyoming’s Energy Future.

Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said he has mixed feelings about the fate of federal energy assistance programs, especially those that encourage rooftop solar. Case admits to being perhaps the state’s most notorious critic of rooftop solar — he’s sponsored several bills to overhaul the state’s rooftop solar net-metering law.

“I think pricing is not very good under a net-metering situation, because the person that’s making the installation avoids fixed costs and the utility makes up those costs from other customers,” he said.

A large portion of Case’s district includes the Wind River Reservation. He said he supports energy assistance efforts there, and for low-income communities and households across the state. But, “I do want to have that dialogue about fixing that — net-metering — and a lot of other things.”

Last year, Gov. Mark Gordon established the Grants Management Office to assist local governments, businesses and nonprofits in pursuing state and federal grant programs, including initiatives under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act. The office has already fielded 500 requests, according to an annual report.

For his part, Gordon “recognizes that the Trump administration may have different priorities than the previous administration,” Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile via email. “Ultimately, this is a decision being made at the federal level and the Governor respects whatever the final decision is on the status of those programs.”

Following multiple fatalities caused by electric devices in San Francisco, traffic safety advocates are pointing to a need for stronger regulation and classification for electric-powered or motorized modes of transportation.
The stakes, said Christopher White, executive director of the San Francisco Bike Coalition, can be life or death.
The San Francisco Bike Coalition, however, said that based on eyewitness accounts and videos circulating online, they believe Mederer was riding a more powerful, faster vehicle, most likely an e-moped, which requires a motorcycle license.
“It can propagate narratives in the minds of the public that are not true about the safety or lack of safety of different devices,” White said.","On July 21, Janarden Dangi was working a dinner shift at Nepa Indian Cuisine, a restaurant near Divisadero and Fell streets in San Francisco’s Panhandle neighborhood, when he saw police sirens.

Outside, he joined a small crowd looking out at a gruesome scene — a crash between two pedestrians and a rider of an electric-powered vehicle — near the intersection around 11 p.m.

Dangi saw a “white-haired” man lying on the pavement.

“He was half covered by his helmet,” Dangi said. “It was really bad.”

In its initial report, San Francisco Police stated that the person, identified as Matthias Mederer, 64, was riding an e-bike at the time of the crash, which also injured two people.

But in the days and weeks following, confusion arose: was it an e-bike, which doesn’t require a special license to operate — or something else?

Following multiple fatalities caused by electric devices in San Francisco, traffic safety advocates are pointing to a need for stronger regulation and classification for electric-powered or motorized modes of transportation.

The stakes, said Christopher White, executive director of the San Francisco Bike Coalition, can be life or death.

“We just want to make sure that the public has the information that is true and accurate,” White said. “That is what should be guiding policies that develop to keep people safer on the streets.”

In a subsequent statement to KQED on Aug. 8, SFPD again reiterated that the crash involved an e-bike.

The San Francisco Bike Coalition, however, said that based on eyewitness accounts and videos circulating online, they believe Mederer was riding a more powerful, faster vehicle, most likely an e-moped, which requires a motorcycle license.

Dangi also told KQED that the vehicle in question appeared to be “a modified moped.”

“It was not a proper motorbike,” Dangi said. “It was modified with a big sound.”

Dangi added that the corner is often busy and that “people have to be very careful in this intersection.”

The tragedy unfolded against the backdrop of ongoing conversations among state legislators on the prevalence of e-bikes and motorized scooters, and a possible need for increased safety laws.

Under California law, the term “e-bike” can only apply to three classes of electric bicycles with pedals that are capped at 28 miles per hour.

White said they’re commonly confused and misreported as e-mopeds and e-motorbikes: vehicles that go way above that speed and require a motorcycle license.

“It can propagate narratives in the minds of the public that are not true about the safety or lack of safety of different devices,” White said.

White pointed to a fatal collision on Market and Sixth streets just days before the fatal accident on July 21 as a case study: an elderly pedestrian was struck by an electric scooter on July 18 while he crossed the intersection, later succumbing to his injuries at a local hospital.

When SFPD initially responded to the scene, it reported that the vehicle involved was a Lime e-scooter, but later said it remained unclear what kind of scooter it was. Lime also confirmed that the rider was not on one of the company’s electric scooters.

The distinction is significant, White said, because electric scooters have their own classification and the California DMV mandates a 15 mph limit for motorized scooters.

But still, with reports on all sides unconfirmed, the gray area in how motorized devices are classified is starkly apparent.

White recommended that the city develop what he called a “hierarchy of road vulnerability,” or an awareness campaign about the kinds of vehicles on streets and what dangers they pose to pedestrians.

“Those on the streets who can cause more harm to others because of the speed or the heaviness of their vehicles or devices, bear greater responsibility,” White said. “To keep more vulnerable road users, whether that’s pedestrians, seniors, people with disabilities, safe in how they behave.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/250808-MOPEDDEATH-16-KQED.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:12:40.284833

The plan involves storing thermal energy – heat – in giant piles of dirt alongside this leftover, formerly coal-fired infrastructure.
This assessment would certainly extend to dirt batteries.
As of 2022, the energy storage market was valued at $198.8 billion.
By helping to align energy supply and demand as variable energy sources become more dominant in local and national energy mixes, energy storage is critical to energy security as well as the industry bottom line.","The Trump administration is attempting to breathe new life into the nation’s declining coal industry, but greater market forces indicate that the dirtiest fossil fuel will likely continue its terminal decline. Though the sitting president has signed an executive order aimed at “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,“ there are zero new coal plants under construction as utilities “continue to prioritize adding renewables, batteries, gas and nuclear power ahead of new coal-fired capacity based on the cost and efficiency.”

It’s undeniable that the domestic coal industry is aging out. “There's been six times more coal power plants retired than constructed in the U.S. this century, which underscores the scope of the challenge facing even the most ardent coal bulls as they try to engineer an industry revival,” Reuters reports. Experts agree that the United States coal industry peaked about two decades ago, as lowering prices for natural gas and solar rendered the industry obsolete.

But energy industry insiders think that there may be new life coming down the pike for decommissioned coal plants. However, that new life will not contribute to the United States’ fossil fuel renaissance, but instead to the stymied but ongoing clean energy transition. A team of researchers at Stanford University is working on turning retired coal plants into energy storage facilities by taking advantage of the plants’ turbine blades and connected generators.

The plan involves storing thermal energy – heat – in giant piles of dirt alongside this leftover, formerly coal-fired infrastructure. “Most dirt includes naturally heat-resistant materials, such as silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide,” reports New Scientist. Industrial heaters within the insulated dirt pile can maintain temperatures of about 600° Celsius (1,112° Fahrenheit). When renewable energy sources create a surplus of energy, that extra energy can be stored as heat until it is needed on the grid, at which point it would be piped out via steam, which would then turn a turbine to create electricity.

While it may sound too low-brow (a pile of dirt?) to be a real energy solution of the future, the plan has real-world precedent. In Finland, two similar batteries – stored in heaps of sand rather than dirt – are already up and running, and providing energy and heat to whole towns in the dead of Nordic winters. “With high specific heat, low thermal conductivity, and no risk of fire, sand-based energy storage systems are gaining traction in grid-scale and industrial heating applications,” Interesting Engineering reported earlier this month. This assessment would certainly extend to dirt batteries.

One of the critical benefits of these battery types is that they are ridiculously cost-effective. As New Scientist reports, perhaps unnecessarily, “dirt is cheaper, more abundant and more widely available than other types of long-term energy storage, such as lithium batteries or hydrogen fuel.”

Another key benefit is that repurposing shuttered coal plants as energy storage centers could bring much-needed jobs and tax revenue to coal country and contribute to a just transition in which fossil-fuel-dependent local economies are not left behind.

If developed intentionally and with a just transition in mind, energy storage projects would not merely function as a bandaid over much bigger economic issues in coal country – they could serve as a real lifeline. As of 2022, the energy storage market was valued at $198.8 billion. Allied Market Research estimates that this will climb to $329.1 billion by 2032, with a compound annual growth rate of 5.2% from 2023 to 2032.

By helping to align energy supply and demand as variable energy sources become more dominant in local and national energy mixes, energy storage is critical to energy security as well as the industry bottom line. Due to its central role in decarbonizing energy grids, energy storage is heating up to be “clean energy’s next trillion-dollar business.” All of this means that storage on unused coal plants while taking advantage of existing infrastructure is a no-brainer, especially when the required materials come dirt cheap – literally.

These energy-storage systems offer numerous – and significant – benefits over conventional designs. Solid-state packs have higher energy density for greater range. These batteries are also less likely to catch on fire, have a longer lifespan, and can charge faster than conventional batteries. Solid-state electron reservoirs sound like an absolute EV game-changer, and countless automakers, academics, and supplier companies alike are researching the technology, though curiously, Tesla may not be as bullish on the technology as others are.

Existing Designs Still Have A Lot Of Life Left

Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, shared a few thoughts about solid-state batteries during an interview at the X Takeover 2025 event in San Mateo, California. “You know, if you look year-over-year, battery improvements have always been incremental … about three-percent energy density improvement year-over-year, something like that, and maybe similar in fast charge,” Moravy explained. “And I think that that’s going to keep going for a long time, and we’re going to find a lot more improvements in the batteries that we make in our vehicles,” the engineering executive added.

Over the years, Tesla and its partners – companies like CATL, LG, and Panasonic – have figured out how to dramatically enhance their battery cell designs. As Moravy explained, incremental improvements in the electrolytes used, how cathodes are designed, and what kind of anodes are employed have resulted in significant gains. Also, manufacturing technology has changed, which results in better packing density for a longer vehicle range.

Expect This Trend To Continue

“You can go back decades to figure out when the first lithium-ion battery happened, and follow that linear trend,” said Moravy. “And I think we’ll continue on that trend, and [we’ll] continue to refine it. Every couple of years or so, we change over our entire battery cell factories with our vendors.”

Existing lithium-ion battery designs will almost certainly continue getting better in the future but, “That doesn’t mean we don’t also look at trends like solid-state batteries and super caps (capacitors) and other things that might provide other alternatives of energy,” noted Moravy. “But you know, lithium-ion and lithium iron-phosphate, those cells have really proven their worth in terms of like energy density and capability, and I really think we’re only in the beginning of that. I still think there’s a lot of gains to be made in microchemistry and in those formfactors.”

There Are Many Challenges Left To Address

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

Last week, an appeals court authorized President Trump’s order instructing agencies to end collective bargaining agreements to move forward while challenges to the order played out in court.

That order, which Mr. Trump signed in March and framed as critical to protecting national security, was part of a sweeping effort to assert more control over the federal work force.

The lawsuit said that migrants often sleep on the concrete floor or sitting upright, lack access to legal counsel and are subjected to a “horrific stench” emanating from toilets next to where they sleep.

A video recorded by a migrant who sneaked in a cellphone last month appeared to confirm some of those complaints, as has recent reporting by The New York Times.

The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, a Peruvian immigrant who entered the United States in July 2022 and lives in New Jersey. He was arrested by ICE on Friday as he was leaving a routine appearance in immigration court, where he was facing deportation proceedings and applying for asylum after being charged with entering the country unlawfully.

Mr. Barco Mercado, a father of two, including a 3-month-old, is being held at 26 Federal Plaza, where the lawsuit said dozens of people were often crammed into a space that was just 215 square feet. His lawyers are seeking that a judge certify the suit as a class-action lawsuit.

“People are being deprived of their basic rights, facing medical neglect, and they lack access to adequate food and hygiene,” said Harold Solis, a co-legal director of Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group representing Mr. Barco Mercado. “This cruel detention policy is immoral and inhumane.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The agency has denied claims of unsanitary conditions at 26 Federal Plaza, telling The Times recently that “overcrowding or subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false.” Agency officials have described the holding cells as temporary processing centers, not long-term detention facilities. They have used that designation to justify denying access to members of Congress who have sought to inspect the cells in recent months.

The 10th-floor cells hold undocumented immigrants arrested by agents at the city’s immigration courts, one of which is just two floors above the cells. Immigrants held there are typically processed and shuttled to detention centers elsewhere in the New York area or in other states, including Pennsylvania and Texas.

New federal data analyzed by The Times shows that about half of the more than 2,300 people arrested by ICE in the New York City area since Mr. Trump returned to office in January have been held at 26 Federal Plaza. Concerns about detention facility conditions have surfaced across the country as Trump officials race to find enough space to hold the migrants whom Mr. Trump wants to expel as part his mass deportation campaign.

The lawsuit argued that detainees have no way to communicate with their lawyers while being held in the Lower Manhattan cells, are denied access to their prescribed medications and are served meals so meager that one detainee lost 24 pounds. It also said that ICE was violating its own policies that limit stays at such facilities to 72 hours. The lawsuit said that some detainees have been held for more than a week and that one person was held for 10 days.

Mr. Barco Mercado is also being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the law firm Wang Hecker.

Some of the same groups filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court last week challenging the federal government’s practice of arresting migrants showing up for routine hearings in immigration court. That lawsuit, coming two weeks after a similar class-action lawsuit was filed in Washington, D.C., argued that the arrests had turned the courts “into traps.”

The courthouse arrests have driven a spike in the detention of undocumented immigrants without criminal records in New York, according to the recent Times analysis. The lawsuit filed last week in Manhattan argued that the arrests have undermined due process and discouraged migrants from appearing for their mandated court hearings, which in turn puts them at risk of deportation.

Trump officials have defended the courthouse arrests as a “common sense” tactic to easily arrest and swiftly deport migrants who entered the country illegally under former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. without having to send ICE agents into neighborhoods.

Democratic members of Congress from New York have sought access to the holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza but have repeatedly been denied entry by ICE. A dozen Democratic lawmakers — including Representatives Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York — sued the federal government last month because of its refusal to allow members into immigration facilities in California, New York, Texas and elsewhere.

Many migrants held at 26 Federal Plaza are moved to detention centers in the New York City region, including a new facility in Newark known as Delaney Hall, a county jail on Long Island that began holding immigrants for ICE this year, and longstanding facilities in the Hudson Valley and near Buffalo.

Under a recent agreement with the Bureau of Prisons, ICE also began holding more than 100 detainees at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, which has a long history of conditions that some federal judges have described as “barbaric.”

Mr. Goldman and Mr. Espaillat, along with Representative Nydia Velázquez, a fellow Democrat of New York, were denied access to the Metropolitan Detention Center on Wednesday after showing up to conduct oversight.

On the same day, Commerce Secretary Howard W. Lutnick sent a letter to Alan M. Garber, Harvard’s president, claiming that the university had not lived up to its obligations surrounding federally funded patents, which are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. According to the letter, the agency will begin a comprehensive review of Harvard’s compliance with federal law.

The additional pressures on Harvard come during a week when the government had also taken significant steps to bring other schools into line with its agenda. President Trump issued a directive that would require colleges and universities to submit reams of new data on students to check whether they are complying with a Supreme Court decision that ended race-based affirmative action. The White House also intensified its campaign against the University of California, Los Angeles, which it stripped of hundreds of millions in research funds over a list of issues.

In the court case involving Harvard, the Justice Department was asking a judge to throw out one of two pending lawsuits filed by Harvard against the administration, this one involving the right of the nation’s oldest university’s right to host international students.

Earlier in the year, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, moved to end Harvard’s right to host the students. Harvard sued. When Judge Allison Burroughs of federal court in Boston temporarily blocked the administration action, the White House countered in June by issuing a proclamation blocking international students that invoked a different provision of law.

Judge Burroughs, who has expressed skepticism of the Trump administration’s crusade against Harvard from the bench and also in written orders, also blocked that effort, issuing a preliminary injunction.

On Friday, the government moved to dismiss the lawsuit entirely. (The government’s motion on Friday applied only to the case involving international students. It has no effect on the university’s lawsuit against the administration about research funding cuts, a case that focuses heavily on constitutional and procedural concerns.)

The government’s effort could have disrupted the lives of about 5,000 international students attending Harvard last spring, another 2,000 recent graduates, as well as a new cohort of students who plan to arrive this fall.

“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit said. The university has accused the government of retaliating against it for its refusal to bend to the White House’s efforts to control the university’s “governance, curriculum and the ideology of faculty and students.”

In its filing Friday, the administration denied that contention. Instead, it listed a number of accusations it has made in previous filings and statements about the school, including that violent crime has increased on campus.

Harvard pointed to reporting showing its campus has very low-crime overall. The university’s student newspaper, the Harvard Crimson, has reported that the campus police responded to nearly twice as many crimes on campus in 2023 as in 2021, mostly over reports of stolen electric bikes and scooters.

There was no evidence that international students were involved in the crimes.

In a statement, Harvard said the motion on Friday “has no impact on Harvard’s ability to enroll international students and scholars.”

“The university will continue to defend its rights — and the rights of its students and scholars,” the statement added.

In a separate move on Friday, the administration added to its pressure campaign against Harvard when the Commerce Department said it would investigate whether the university was complying with federal laws and regulations around intellectual property that emerge from government-backed research.

The investigation is expected to examine whether Harvard complied with myriad requirements related to how the university procures and maintains patents for its ideas and research.

In his letter to Dr. Garber, Mr. Lutnick said that his department “places immense value on the groundbreaking scientific and technological advancements from the government’s partnerships with institutions like Harvard.” But, Mr. Lutnick warned, Harvard was also required to follow rules designed to maximize “the benefits to the American public.”

Mr. Lutnick did not include any evidence showing that Harvard, whose researchers generally secure scores of patents each year, had violated the law, but he said that the Commerce Department thought that the university had “failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer.”

Patents can be extraordinarily lucrative for research universities, with their collective values climbing far into the millions of dollars. But if a university does not follow an array of regulatory requirements, the government can essentially dilute or strip a school of its financial stake.

Mr. Lutnick said the government was “initiating” that process. His department asked Harvard to provide a range of records to the government by Sept. 5.

In a statement on Friday, Harvard blasted the Commerce Department’s letter as “unprecedented” and “yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.”

“Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are lifesaving and industry-redefining,” the university said, adding that it was “fully committed” to complying with federal law.

Michael C. Bender contributed reporting.

During those hearings, F.A.A. officials assigned to air traffic control facilities testified that managers had ignored or otherwise rejected appeals for increased staffing, route changes and other measures that might have improved safety. Taking such steps, they said, might have kept the pilots of an Army Black Hawk helicopter from flying into the path of American Airlines Flight 5342 before the January collision.

The audit comes after a bipartisan appeal from lawmakers, who formally requested in June that the Transportation Department’s inspector general undertake the effort. Their appeal was backed by Sean Duffy, the Transportation Department secretary, who oversees the F.A.A.

The audit “will demand answers about why the F.A.A. ignored over 15,000 dangerous helicopter incidents and allowed military aircraft to fly without critical safety equipment in DCA’s congested airspace,” Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said in a statement.

But she noted that the Army’s inspector general, whom the senators urged to begin a parallel investigation, had yet to commit to doing so.

The transportation inspector general’s audit will focus on an examination of how the F.A.A. oversaw the flight routes around Reagan National Airport, including any safety gaps. It also will scrutinize the F.A.A.’s exemption policies from requirements that aircraft utilize real-time tracking technology that broadcasts their location to control towers.

The Army Black Hawk that crashed into the commercial jet on Jan. 29 had its real-time tracking system, known as ADS-B Out, turned off. Subsequent scrutiny revealed its technology was nonfunctional, the chairwoman of the N.T.S.B., Jennifer Homendy, told reporters last week. She added that the technology was not working for eight of the 16 UH-60L Black Hawk helicopters in that Army unit’s fleet.

Lawmakers had asked the Army’s inspector general to investigate how the military coordinates its Washington operations with the F.A.A., and scrutinize policies regarding pilot training and qualifications, and the condition and use of the tracking technology in its Black Hawk helicopters. It also asked the military to look into its system for cataloging and responding to near-miss events when its helicopters flew too close to commercial aircraft.

In a statement, a group of the family members of passengers of Flight 5342 admonished the Army for not yet announcing a similar probe.

“The concerns raised in recent N.T.S.B. hearings demand a systemwide, transparent review of their role in protecting shared airspace, not incremental or closed-door adjustments,” the statement read. “We owe it to the 67 lives lost — and to every passenger who boards a plane — to ensure these lessons lead to lasting, lifesaving change.”

A spokeswoman for the Army did not respond to a request for comment.

The F.A.A. has said it is working to hire more air traffic controllers amid a persistent shortage and has imposed restrictions on the airspace around Reagan National Airport since the crash, revising helicopter routes and closing one known as Route 4 between Hains Point, the tip of a small island in the Potomac River north of the airport, and the Wilson Bridge, to the airport’s south.

It has also limited the number of helicopters that are allowed to traverse the airspace without their ADS-B Out technology turned on, with exemptions for a handful of V.I.P. events or national security missions, and only when the area has been cleared of commercial traffic.

Fannie and Freddie, which have been under the government’s control since the housing market meltdown of 2008, remain a linchpin of the $12 trillion mortgage market.

Mr. Trump and his advisers have said the companies could be valued at around $500 billion collectively, according to two of the people.

While some shares of the companies still trade over the counter, the new shares would be listed on a major stock market and could yield tens of billions of dollars.

Proceeds from the proposed stock sale, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, could help the government generate a return on the money it spent bailing out the companies in 2008, while also infusing the mortgage firms with private capital.

Mr. Trump telegraphed his intent to pursue a public offering in May, writing on his Truth Social platform that he was giving “very serious consideration to bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public.”

At the time, Mr. Trump wrote that the companies were “throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right.”

But those plans appear to have accelerated over the past three weeks, as Mr. Trump summoned chief executives of the nation’s largest banks into meetings at the White House.

In those meetings, Mr. Trump told the Wall Street executives and their deputies that he was intent on moving quickly, according to two people briefed on the meetings.

Mr. Trump asked bank executives, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and Jane Fraser of Citigroup, to explain how they would execute a deal.

It’s unclear just how the plan would work. A critical question that was not resolved in the meetings with bankers is whether Fannie and Freddie would remain under government control after the stock sale. On one hand, a government-controlled company would mitigate the risks to investors and the mortgage market, but it would also leave investors with less sway over the company’s decisions.

Plans for taking Fannie and Freddie out of a government conservatorship have been discussed on and off for years without any agreed-upon solution for doing so.

In addition to the bankers invited to the White House, other Wall Street investors and advisers have been invited recently to meet with Treasury officials to discuss the stock sale, two of the people said.

It’s unclear exactly how stock market investors would value the mortgage giants and whether that valuation would be anywhere near the $500 billion price tag the Trump administration is discussing.

Neither Fannie, which is officially called the Federal National Mortgage Association, nor Freddie, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, actually make loans.

They buy mortgages from banks and package those loans into securities that are sold to big investors. In creating those mortgage-backed securities, Fannie and Freddie guarantee bond investors that they will be made whole if too many mortgage borrowers default. That guarantee helps keep mortgage rates low.

In 2008, bond investors and investors in shares of Fannie and Freddie panicked as more and more homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. The government ultimately stepped in with a $187 billion bailout to prevent the firms from filing for bankruptcy.

A public stock offering could help some wealthy investors, including William A. Ackman and the Trump donor and adviser John Paulson, who invested in the mortgage firms at deeply discounted prices. A stock offering doesn’t guarantee them a windfall, though, because the issuance of new shares could also dilute the value of their existing stock

Mr. Ackman has been arguing for years that the conservatorship should be ended. In January, he prepared a 104-page presentation called The Art of the Deal that lays out his case for ending the conservatorship. (The presentation’s title is an allusion to Mr. Trump’s book of the same name.)

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously has said that while he favors ending the government control of Fannie and Freddie, he would not do anything that would cause an increase in mortgage rates, which have risen in recent years, constraining housing sales.

Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has been taking bold steps at Fannie and Freddie. One of Mr. Pulte’s first acts as director was to appoint himself as the chair of both Fannie and Freddie — an unprecedented act.

It is unclear how much investor appetite exists for shares in the mortgage firms, particularly given the likely scale of the offering. Fannie and Freddie must sell enough in any offering to pay back investors and the federal government on the equity stakes they still hold and have sufficient cushion to cover any losses from the mortgages they guarantee.

The stock offering would be a boon for Wall Street banks that garner giant fees for advising on the deals. Because of the sheer size of the listing and the number of individual government entities involved, a slew of different banks would take part.

“We’re going to get some back, and we’re going to get some switched,” Mr. Trump said while hosting the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan for a peace summit at the White House. “There’ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both, but we’ll be talking about that either later, or tomorrow.”

The meeting, the first in-person summit between an American and Russian president since President Joseph R. Biden Jr. met with Mr. Putin in June 2021, reflects Mr. Trump’s confidence in his ability to persuade Mr. Putin in a face-to-face encounter, a goal that has eluded Mr. Trump and his predecessors. For Mr. Putin, the meeting itself is a victory after he spent the past several months largely isolated from the international community, with NATO leaders — other than Mr. Trump — refusing to communicate directly with him.

The meeting also presents a host of challenges. Ukrainian leaders have adamantly opposed relinquishing any of their land to Russia, and the country’s constitution bars President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine from ceding any territory.

There would also be numerous political and military hurdles for Ukraine in turning over land to Russia, as well as questions including security guarantees for Ukraine and the future of frozen Russian assets. And many diplomats have suggested that Mr. Putin may be more interested in dragging out diplomacy to give him time to pummel Ukraine than in securing a peace deal.

White House officials declined to say exactly where in Alaska the two leaders would meet or why Mr. Trump decided to hold the meeting there, though it is the closest U.S. state to Russia. In 2021, the Biden administration held talks with China in Anchorage, Alaska.

Mr. Trump also provided little additional detail about the meeting, what territory could be swapped or the broader contours of a peace deal, saying earlier Friday that he did not want to overshadow the peace pledge between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But he told European leaders earlier this week that he planned to follow up his session with Mr. Putin with a meeting with Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and an advocate for U.S. support of Ukraine, praised Mr. Trump’s announcement of the meeting.

“To those who criticize President Trump for being willing to meet with Putin to end the bloodbath in Ukraine — remember Reagan met with Gorbachev to try to end the Cold War,” he posted on social media. “I’m confident President Trump will walk away — like Reagan — if Putin insists on a bad deal.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday in an interview with EWTN, a Catholic media organization, that the United States has “some understanding” of what the Russians want “to stop this war from a diplomatic standpoint.”

“Now, I’m not claiming that what the Russians would need and what Ukraine would need are the same,” he said, without providing specifics. “There’s a difference, and there’s a gap there.”

He added: “Can we bridge the gap between the Ukrainian side and the Russian side on this close enough so the president can come in as part of any sort of meeting and maybe be the closer on this deal?”

Even a successful meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin would be just an opening move in any deal. Beyond the question of territory, a number of equally thorny issues would need to be settled. Among them is whether Mr. Zelensky would get security guarantees from Europe, the United States or NATO to keep Russia from pausing, then resuming, a war to try to take the rest of the country.

In the past, Mr. Putin has also demanded sharp limits on the number and quality of arms that the West could provide to Ukraine, and he has argued for a variety of steps that could change the government, including elections, which he would presumably try to influence by seeking to place a more pro-Russia leader.

Russian officials have demanded that Ukraine cede the four regions that Moscow claimed to have “annexed” from Ukraine in late 2022, even as some of that land remains under Ukrainian control.

Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with his inability to end a conflict that, as a candidate for president, he promised he would settle in 24 hours. And since taking office, he has oscillated in his approach to Russia. Earlier in his term, he showed considerable deference to Mr. Putin, to the point of joining North Korea in opposing a United Nations resolution condemning Russia for its 2022 invasion.

He also berated Mr. Zelensky in the Oval Office earlier this year for not showing enough gratitude to the United States for its military support, telling the Ukrainian leader that he didn’t “have the cards” to negotiate a peace deal. But more recently, he has criticized Mr. Putin for not accepting the terms of a proposed cease-fire, and for prolonging the conflict.

Steve Witkoff, Mr. Trump’s special envoy, met with Mr. Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, a session Mr. Trump said was “highly productive.” But shortly after the meeting, Mr. Trump announced he would increase tariffs on India to 50 percent, as a penalty for purchasing Russian oil.

Friday also marked the deadline for Russia to agree to a cease-fire before Mr. Trump imposed additional sanctions on its oil exports, though it appeared Mr. Trump would not follow through on that threat after announcing his meeting with Mr. Putin.

The new label reads: “On Jan. 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice. The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on Jan. 6. Because Trump’s term ended on Jan. 20, he became the first former president tried by the Senate. He was acquitted on Feb. 13, 2021.”

The change came after the National Museum of American History in Washington last month took down a temporary addition to an exhibition about the American presidency that referred to President Trump’s two impeachments to update it as part of what museum officials described as a review of the institution’s content for bias.

The new labeling that went up on Friday also changed the description of President Trump’s first impeachment, in 2019, adding the word “alleged” to a line that now reads: “The charges focused on the president’s alleged solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election and defiance of Congressional subpoenas.”

The Smithsonian said in a statement Friday that “at the heart of the Smithsonian’s work is a steadfast commitment to scholarship, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history.”

“Adhering to principles foundational to our role as the nation’s museum, we take great care to ensure that what we present to the public reflects both intellectual integrity and thoughtful design,” the Smithsonian said.

It noted that the placard it had replaced had been put up as a temporary exhibit in 2021, and that it had blocked some of the other items in the display case. “We removed it to make way for a more permanent update to the content inside the case,” the Smithsonian said.

Samuel J. Redman, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said that while historians were bound to continually revise their takes on history, he found some of the changes “troubling.”

“The resulting chilling effect seems clear,” he said. “The Smithsonian curators and museum specialists are walking a tightrope, attempting to stick to factual interpretations about the recent past while experiencing pressure to minimize any bad information about the Trump administration.”

The new labeling is accompanied by new artifacts: admission tickets to the Senate gallery after Mr. Trump’s first impeachment. The updated display also includes a rewrite of the main exhibit panel to more fully explain the mechanics of impeachment, the Smithsonian said.

The removal of the original text in July came after the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents, which governs the institution, had committed to reviewing its content after pressure from the Trump administration. Mr. Trump has called for what he has described as a more positive framing of the country’s history in Smithsonian museums. After the president announced this spring that he had fired the director of another museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian asserted that it holds the power over personnel. But the director then resigned.

The temporary removal of the label about Mr. Trump’s impeachment became national news, and some critics accused the Smithsonian of bowing to pressure from the White House to rewrite history. The Smithsonian said it had received no presidential instruction to take it down, and that it made the changes because the temporary display did not meet its usual presentational standards.

The labeling was part of an exhibit on the American presidency that opened at the Museum of American History in 2000. The exhibit also includes information about the impeachments of former Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, and notes that former President Richard M. Nixon was facing possible impeachment when he resigned from office.

A label referencing Mr. Trump’s two impeachments was added in 2021. Mr. Trump is the only American president to have been impeached twice, in 2019 and again in 2021. He was acquitted both times after facing trials in the Senate.

The Smithsonian has been closely scrutinized by Mr. Trump, who issued an executive order in March asserting that the country had “witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our nation’s history” by the institution. He argued that the Smithsonian had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.”

In the order, he called on Vice President JD Vance, a member of the Smithsonian’s board, to work with Congress to prohibit expenditures on exhibitions or programs that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote ideologies inconsistent with federal law.”

A gregarious and colorful personality, Mr. Long had tried to cultivate a connection with the depleted and demoralized I.R.S. work force. He visited I.R.S. locations around the country and repeatedly sent emails to all I.R.S. employees allowing them to leave work early on Friday afternoons.

“With this being Thursday before another FriYay, please enjoy a 70-minute early exit tomorrow. That way you’ll be rested for my 70th birthday on Monday!” Mr. Long wrote to staff on Thursday.

His departure intensifies the management turmoil that has plagued the agency since Mr. Trump took office. Mr. Bessent will serve as the acting head of the I.R.S. while the Trump administration finds and confirms a new commissioner, a senior administration official said, making the Treasury secretary the seventh individual to lead the tax agency this year.

Mr. Long wrote on social media that he would be nominated to become the next U.S. ambassador to Iceland. “It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland,” Mr. Long wrote. “I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead.”

In another post on Friday afternoon, Mr. Long clarified that filing season would not start late next year. “Rest assured tax filing season will start at the customary time,” he wrote.

Mr. Long had remarked to some colleagues that he had to ask Mr. Bessent for permission for everything he did at the I.R.S., two of the people familiar with the decision to remove him said. Others added that the Trump administration officials had been considering moving Mr. Long to a new position for several weeks.

One person familiar with the decision maintained that Mr. Bessent had been supportive of Mr. Long and had pushed the Senate to confirm him, which it did in June along party lines.

In a statement, the Treasury Department thanked Mr. Long “for his commitment to public service and the American people,” and said a new commissioner would be announced “at an appropriate time.”

The I.R.S. is at the center of one of the Trump administration’s top priorities, carrying out the huge tax cut Republicans passed into law last month. The agency, along with the Treasury Department, is responsible for writing the rules for and disseminating information about several tricky issues in the law, including who can claim new tax breaks for tipped income and overtime pay.

That is a tall task that former I.R.S. officials said would only become more challenging amid the internal turbulence. More than 25,000 people have left the agency under Mr. Trump, roughly a quarter of the staff it had at the start of January, according to the Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration. Congress is also eyeing steep budget cuts to the I.R.S.

“It has to have some impact on the agency’s ability to deliver this major piece of legislation,” said Terry Lemons, who led the I.R.S.’s communication efforts before retiring this year. “The people who are left, are they going to be able to handle this high volume with fewer staff and the potential for more budget cuts hanging over their heads?”

Mr. Trump had broken from recent precedent when he said would nominate Mr. Long last year. For decades, I.R.S. commissioners served five-year terms, an attempt to insulate the technocratic yet powerful position from partisan politics. Daniel Werfel, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s choice to lead the I.R.S., stepped down in January.

A string of acting commissioners then led the agency, several of whom quit earlier this year as the Trump administration leaned on the I.R.S. to abandon its longstanding protections of taxpayer information and share data with immigration officials. One of the previous acting commissioners, an I.R.S. agent named Gary Shapley, was replaced within just a few days this spring after Mr. Bessent protested to Mr. Trump that Elon Musk had installed the I.R.S. leader without consulting him, The New York Times previously reported.

“In just a handful of months, Trump and his crew have already gutted taxpayer service, weaponized IRS data against innocent taxpayers and set us up for disaster when next year’s filing season comes around,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement.

There had been hope among some at the I.R.S. that Mr. Long would restore some amount of stability to the agency, even though he had supported legislation calling for its abolition while in Congress. Instead, John Koskinen, who served as I.R.S. commissioner in the Obama and Trump administrations, said Mr. Long may have had the shortest tenure ever for a Senate-confirmed leader of the agency.

“It has to be a new American record for the shortest I.R.S. tenure in history,” he said. “Obviously, he had no background in tax and no background in management. You give him a 75,000-person agency in charge of the tax code, and it is a bit of a challenge.”

Republicans have long taken a hostile approach to the I.R.S., seeking to cut its budget and weaken its ability to conduct audits. Republican members of Congress had cheered Mr. Long’s decision to place two top I.R.S. officials, including the leader of the large-business and international division, on administrative leave. Before he left, Mr. Long amplified a post on social media about the need to “purge” the agency’s work force.

The I.R.S. did not respond to a request for comment.

A key part of the breakthrough was an announcement from Armenia giving the United States exclusive development rights to a transit corridor through its territory, connecting Azerbaijan, which sits east of Armenia, to Nakhichevan, a noncontiguous enclave to Armenia’s west that features Azerbaijan’s only border with Turkey, an important ally.

The 27-mile corridor will be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, and run along Armenia’s southern border with Iran.

At the meeting on Friday, Mr. Trump described the naming of the route as a “great honor for me.”

Mr. Pashinyan called the joint declaration a “game-changing outcome,” heralding a new chapter “of peace, prosperity, security and economic cooperation in the South Caucasus.” He cited the “blessed are the peacemakers” passage of the Bible as he praised Mr. Trump for mediating the deal.

Mr. Aliyev also credited Mr. Trump for bringing the decades-long conflict with Armenia closer to an end.

“If not for President Trump and his team,” he said, “probably today Armenia and Azerbaijan would have been again in this endless process of negotiations.”

Both men said they would endorse Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“Thirty-five years of death and hatred, and now it’s going to be love and success together,” Mr. Trump said.

For a president who ran on an “America First” agenda eschewing United States involvement abroad, Mr. Trump has shown an eagerness to cast himself as a global peacemaker, even as the conflicts he has promised to end — in Ukraine and Gaza — are still boiling.

In open pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Trump has involved himself in peace negotiations between Cambodia and Thailand; the military conflict between Israel and Iran; and tensions between India and Pakistan. The United States has also been involved in a temporary peace deal between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

“I’ve stopped six wars,” Mr. Trump said last month in Turnberry, Scotland. “I’m averaging about a war a month.”

The latest agreement comes after months of shuttle diplomacy between Armenia and Azerbaijan, capped off with a series of more recent face-to-face sessions between Mr. Pashinyan and Mr. Aliyev, including gatherings at the Kremlin and in Abu Dhabi.

While not a peace deal, the joint declaration is the first formal, signed commitment aimed at permanently ending the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, apart from various cease-fire agreements following periods of the conflict that broke into all-out war. The region has been embroiled in conflict since the two countries declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.

But there are still many potential hurdles between it and its goal of producing a lasting, durable peace.

Azerbaijan and Armenia have had closed borders since the late 1980s, when they began fighting over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region within Azerbaijan’s borders that had, until recently, been populated with ethnic Armenians. In 1993, Turkey also closed its border with Armenia in solidarity with Baku.

The long-running conflict between the Turkic Muslims of Azerbaijan and the Christian Armenians was punctuated by charges of ethnic cleansing on both sides, the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, and the deaths of tens of thousands over almost four decades.

According to the White House, the deal does not resolve the two countries’ competing claims to sovereignty over key regions or delineate the borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan, one of the fundamental issues underpinning their long-running standoff. It also does not address lingering human rights claims resulting from Azerbaijan’s 2023 takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Azerbaijan has insisted that Armenia must amend its constitution to wipe out any claims to Nagorno-Karabakh. While Armenia’s constitution does not directly reference Nagorno-Karabakh, its preamble cites the country’s Declaration of Independence, which refers to the “reunification” of the territory with Armenia.

Still, Mr. Aliyev has said in the past that without such a change, a peace agreement is not possible.

Armenia has been agitating for Azerbaijan to release political prisoners and guarantee that the roughly 150,000 ethnically Armenian residents expelled during the takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh can return to their homes.

Both countries have raised claims against each other in competing cases before the International Court of Justice. It is not clear if those appeals will be withdrawn once the joint declaration committing to a peace agreement is signed. Upon signing, however, Armenia and Azerbaijan will withdraw from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Minsk Group, a mediation format led by Russia, France and the United States that has been trying since 1997 to resolve the conflict, without success.

The creation of the transit corridor named for Mr. Trump is expected to bring its own set of challenges. Already, there have been warnings of a backlash from Tehran, which sees the introduction of an exclusive U.S. economic development zone along its border as a potential threat.

Earlier this week, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top foreign policy adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on social media that the creation of such a corridor would prompt “a firm response from Iran.”

For Azerbaijan, the corridor is a critical overland link between Baku and Turkey; for Armenia, agreeing to it — and striking a peace deal with Azerbaijan — could be critical steps toward normalizing relations with Turkey, the subject of continuing negotiations.

But Armenians in the diaspora have raised concerns that even if Yerevan retains legal authority over the corridor, Azerbaijan could try to use its guaranteed unfettered economic access to try to expand its footprint in the area, and challenge Armenia’s sovereignty.

“What we’re seeing is an agreement rewarding Azerbaijan’s aggression, undermining Armenia’s sovereignty and denying justice to the 150,000 Armenians forced from their homes,” said Alex Galitsky, the policy director for the Armenian National Committee of America.

When asked about potential obstacles to peace, Mr. Aliyev told reporters that “there should be no doubt or no suspicions that any of the sides will step back.” He added that the leaders would not have signed an agreement in the White House if they had not been committed to seeing a deal through.

“What has happened today will result in peace, long-lasting peace, eternal peace in the Caucasus,” Mr. Aliyev added.

“Fully agree, and nothing to add,” Mr. Pashinyan replied.

If U.C.L.A. accedes to the demand, it would be the largest payout — by far — of any university that has so far reached a deal with the White House. Columbia University agreed to pay $221 million in connection with its settlement with the government, and Brown University pledged to spend $50 million with state work force programs.

The University of California’s president, James B. Milliken, said in a statement on Friday that the university had “just received a document from the Department of Justice and is reviewing it.”

He added, “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources, and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country’s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”

Administrators at the campus in Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Julio Frenk, U.C.L.A.’s chancellor, said this week that about $584 million in research funding was already “suspended and at risk.” The university, like many other top schools, is deeply dependent on federal research money; about 11 percent of its revenues come from federal grants and contracts.

The Trump administration has largely targeted elite private universities in recent months as a part of what it has depicted as a campaign to fight antisemitism and reshape institutions that it views as cathedrals of liberalism.

But its turn toward U.C.L.A. has been sharp. On July 29, the day the University of California settled a lawsuit that accused U.C.L.A. of allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block Jewish students on campus, the Justice Department said it believed U.C.L.A. had committed civil rights violations.

Dr. Frenk announced later that week the federal government had started freezing research money.

The White House’s demands of U.C.L.A. fit into a broad pattern of how the Trump administration has targeted California. The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, is one of President Trump’s top political foes and a potential candidate for the White House.

On Thursday, the day before the terms of the White House’s proposed settlement emerged, Mr. Newsom suggested the University of California would not bow to the federal government.

“I will fight like hell to make sure that doesn’t happen,” said Mr. Newsom, an ex officio member of the university’s board of regents. “There’s principles. There’s right and wrong, and we’ll do the right thing, and what President Trump is doing is wrong, and everybody knows it.”

He added that he would “do everything in my power to encourage them to do the right thing and not to become another law firm that bends on their knees, another company that sells their soul, or another institution that takes a shortcut and takes the easy wrong versus the hard right.”

But the University of California has shown a willingness to talk to the federal government. Mr. Milliken, the system’s newly installed president, said on Wednesday that the university had agreed “to engage in dialogue with the federal administration.” Mr. Milliken, though, sharply criticized the administration’s moves against funding.

“These cuts do nothing to address antisemitism,” said Mr. Milliken, who started his job on Aug. 1. “Moreover, the extensive work that U.C.L.A. and the entire University of California have taken to combat antisemitism has apparently been ignored.

The White House’s proposed terms, some of which were first reported by CNN, were not exclusively financial. Among other conditions, the government is seeking the appointment of a monitor to enforce the settlement’s terms, the abolition of scholarships connected to race or ethnicity and the cessation of diversity statements in hiring.

But the government included a provision, as it did with Brown and Columbia, that would seem to keep U.S. officials from using the settlement to interfere directly with academic freedom, admissions and hiring.On Friday, Governor Newsom, along with several other state officials, called the White House’s proposal “a billion-dollar political shakedown.”

“Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice to punish California, crush free thinking, and kneecap the greatest public university system in the world,” the officials said in a statement, adding, “We are united against Trump’s assault and will fight like hell because California will not bow to this kind of disgusting political extortion.”

The administration is negotiating with a handful of universities, including Cornell and Harvard. And although Brown and Columbia each agreed to payments, the government’s settlement with the University of Pennsylvania included no financial penalties.

Among the universities that have been targeted by the Trump administration, Harvard is the only one that has sued, arguing the government’s moves are illegal. It was unclear whether U.C.L.A. would take that step.

Even as Harvard’s case moves through the court system, the school has been in talks with the Trump administration in an effort to end the conflict.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/08/multimedia/08trump-news-promo9p-kwbp/08trump-news-promo9p-kwbp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 18:07:57.560909

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country. Also, rooftop and community solar can help households avoid power shutoffs, which are dangerous in extreme heat and cold.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e462aa1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4943x2595+0+556/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnpr.brightspotcdn.com%2Fdims3%2Fdefault%2Fstrip%2Ffalse%2Fcrop%2F4943x3707%20283%200%2Fresize%2F4943x3707%21%2F%3Furl%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2e%2Fbe%2Feb350ef54ec2b6d0593affe6579e%2Fgettyimages-1747805068.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:09:08.013770

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are ""something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It's something we've been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I've ever seen before,"" said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. ""There's a massive outcry.""

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

""A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,"" said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. ""I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.""

A fix, Peskoe said, is a ""can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia's Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren't nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers ""paying billions more than is necessary.""

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer"" from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens' Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey's governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with ""unreasonable rate increases"" to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a ""pretty good deal"" that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.""

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer ""special deals to favored customers"" like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

""We're talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,"" commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. ""And that's what you don't want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""

August 9, 2025 - OAKLAND — On Friday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the California Air Resources Board joined a coalition of 23 states and cities in submitting a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and to eliminate the basis for those standards — the determination that power plant GHG emissions cause harmful climate change. The coalition asserts in its comments that these standards protect against increased emissions and further acceleration of climate change. The proposal, if finalized, could increase carbon dioxide pollution contributing to climate change by eliminating existing requirements for power plants to take steps to control their carbon dioxide emissions.

“Rolling back emission standards for dirty power plants jeopardizes critical progress at a time when it is most needed to confront the escalating impacts of climate change,” said Attorney General Bonta. “We’ve seen these impacts in California just this year with ravaging fires across Los Angeles. The EPA must stop ignoring the facts and immediately withdraw this reckless proposal.”

The EPA proposal includes a sweeping rollback of all GHG emission standards for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. If finalized, the proposal would repeal both the 2015 New Source Performance Standards and the 2024 Carbon Pollution Standards, which limit carbon emissions from new natural gas-fired and existing coal-fired power plants. It would also rescind EPA’s 2015 finding that power plant GHG emissions significantly contribute to harmful climate change.

Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States are collectively one of the largest contributors to climate pollution anywhere in the world. Failing to control their carbon dioxide emissions will exacerbate significant threats facing California and Californians, intensifying and increasing heat waves, severe storms, flooding, disease, worsening air quality, and harming regional ecosystems. In the last year alone, California has experienced two of the most destructive fires in state history, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, both in Los Angeles County, with over 37,469 acres damaged, 30 deaths, multiple first responders injured, and over 16,251 structures destroyed.

In the comment letter, the coalition asserts that:

EPA’s proposed rule would significantly undermine efforts to address climate change and thus expose communities — particularly low-income and frontline communities — to greater environmental harm.

EPA’s proposed finding that power plants do not “contribute significantly” to greenhouse gas emissions violates the law and common sense.

The proposal arbitrarily and capriciously disregards effective measures plants can take to control their carbon dioxide emissions.

Despite unlawfully and illogically assuming reducing greenhouse gas emissions has zero benefit, EPA still admits that the rules it proposed to repeal are net beneficial to the American public.

In submitting the comment letter, Attorney General Bonta and CARB join the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia, and the Chief Legal Officers of the City and County of Denver, and the Cities of Boulder, Chicago, and New York.",https://goldrushcam.com/sierrasuntimes/images/2018/december/oil.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:08:55.819385

Any information about disparities in pollution and the health impacts of climate change have been the biggest targets of deletion.
“That story is yet to unfold.” So far, the EPA’s climate change website is still intact.
Scientists raised alarm in July when the Trump administration took down the federal website that houses national climate assessments.
Farmers and environmental groups have also filed suit to force the Trump administration to restore federal resources.","Now that we’re about halfway into the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, we can take stock of his administration’s destruction of online environmental resources. It’s worse than last time. It’s also, seemingly, just the beginning — paving the way forward for the president’s polluting agenda.

A watchdog group that monitors publicly-available environmental data has recorded 70 percent more federal website changes during Trump’s first 100 days in office in 2025 compared to the start of his first term in 2017.

Federal agencies are taking broader swings to ax public resources from their websites this time around, the report shows. They’re hiding which communities are most affected by pollution. The Trump administration has not only tossed out the most authoritative national reports on climate change, they’re starting to replace facts and evidence with disinformation. We’re seeing a revisionist history unfold.

“You can say anything you want to say if you remove evidence to the contrary.”

“If you suppress data … you can say anything you want to say if you remove evidence to the contrary,” says Gretchen Gehrke, one of the lead authors of the report published this week by the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative (EDGI).

Looking just at the first 100 days of Trump’s second term compared to the start of his first term, EDGI noted 632 important changes to federal websites this year compared to 371 in 2017. That’s despite EDGI only keeping tabs this year on 20 percent of the websites it monitored during the first term, due to capacity constraints and because the group chose to home in on webpages it thought would be most vulnerable.

They’ve tracked 879 significant changes to 639 different federal webpages during the first 6 months of the current administration. That includes changes to content, like replacing the term “climate change” with “extreme weather,” and the wholesale removal of entire webpages.

Any information about disparities in pollution and the health impacts of climate change have been the biggest targets of deletion. The Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen mapping tool, designed to show which populations are disproportionately impacted by air pollutants and other public health hazards across the US, was one of the first resources lost. Federal agencies had essentially purged any of their publicly-available websites on environmental justice by mid-February, according to the report.

“The thing that is the most different is this total erasure of information about environmental racism and the evidence of environmental racism,” Gehrke says. “In the second Trump administration, information control was about removing evidence of inequality.”

As global warming pushes up sea levels, for example, a 2021 EPA report found that Hispanic and Latino individuals are roughly 50 percent more likely than others to live in coastal areas with the highest estimated increases in traffic delays from worsening high-tide flooding. A press release and PDF of the report are still available online. (Did it escape scrutiny because it’s described as a “social vulnerability report” rather than an environmental justice report?) A link in the press release to more “information about environmental justice,” however, is dead. It simply says “Sorry, but this web page does not exist.”

“Information control was about removing evidence of inequality.”

For resources on climate change more broadly across federal websites, changes have “started really ramping up,” Gehrke says. “That story is yet to unfold.” So far, the EPA’s climate change website is still intact. But the Trump administration has terminated the content production team behind climate.gov, and the URL started redirecting people to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website in June. It’s a warning sign that “it is possible that another significant removal of climate change information is currently unfolding as of the writing of this report,” the EDGI report notes.

Scientists raised alarm in July when the Trump administration took down the federal website that houses national climate assessments. The Congressionally-mandated assessments show how climate change affects each region of the US, from threatening ice fishing in the Midwest to raising the risk of window-smashing hail over the Northern Great Plains. During his first term, Trump got flak for releasing the report on a Friday after Thanksgiving — accused of trying to bury it during a holiday weekend. This year, the Trump administration just went ahead and dismissed all the researchers working on the next iteration of the report. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright went so far as to suggest in an interview with CNN this week that the administration would review previously published assessments and “will come out with updated reports on those.”

Wright, who led an oil and gas company before joining Trump’s cabinet, also commissioned climate skeptics to release a misleading report on greenhouse gas emissions last week that rejects scientific consensus on climate change, It comes on the heels of the Trump administration attempting to take away the EPA’s ability to regulate planet-heating pollution by countering the landmark 2009 “endangerment finding” that accurately finds that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health. Climate change, caused by greenhouse gas emissions, is projected to lead to roughly 250,000 additional deaths each year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat illness between 2030 and 2050, according to the World Health Organization.

Neither the Department of Energy nor NOAA immediately responded to inquiries from The Verge. “President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people to create a more effective and efficient federal government that serves all Americans, and EPA is doing just that,” Brigit Hirsch, EPA Press Secretary, said in an email to The Verge.

Access to as much as 20 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency website was removed throughout Trump’s first term, according to research EDGI published in 2021.

Fortunately, EDGI and other groups have also been working to make data available elsewhere online for the public. The nonprofit Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine can pull up snapshots of what webpages have looked like over the years. Archiving tool Webrecorder also has created mirrors of climate.gov and the US Global Change Research Program website that used to house national climate assessments.

Farmers and environmental groups have also filed suit to force the Trump administration to restore federal resources. Farmers won a legal battle to bring climate content back to US Department of Agriculture webpages. Sierra Club and other groups have sued to bring back EJScreen. In the meantime, a copy of the tool is available from The Public Environmental Data Partners.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25531807/STK175_DONALD_TRUMP_CVIRGINIA_A.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-08-09 18:08:01.887105

Between us, we run nearly two dozen assembly plants, building cars, trucks, and SUVs spread across key markets worldwide. And we’re both in the top 50 for U.S. patents – a clear sign that innovation drives what we do.

I’m excited to share an update on the progress GM and Hyundai have made since the beginning of our partnership last year. Today, we are announcing that we’re going to co-develop five brand new vehicles. Four of these will serve the Central and South American markets, including a mid-size pickup, as well as compact cars, pickups, and SUVs. And for North America, we’re working on an electric commercial van, a smaller sibling to Chevrolet’s BrightDrop vans.

GM will take the lead on the mid-size truck platform, while Hyundai heads up the platforms for the other new models. Each company will sell these vehicles under their own brands, with unique interior and exterior designs. But no matter the badge, everything we build together will carry the stamp of both GM and Hyundai’s engineering, manufacturing, and innovative spirit.

The first of these vehicles are scheduled to roll out in 2028, and we expect production to reach more than 800,000 vehicles a year.

We are also planning joint sourcing initiatives in North and South America for materials, transport, and logistics, including raw materials, components, and complex systems. We will also explore collaboration on low-carbon emissions steel as part of our commitment to sustainable manufacturing.

So, why work with Hyundai? The answer is clear:

By teaming up, we can reduce costs, streamline manufacturing, and launch new models faster.

Joint sourcing and logistics boost efficiency and deliver savings, with room to scale further across raw materials and complex systems.

Our collaboration expands customer choice in key markets and strengthens our competitive edge.

We’re also exploring future propulsion technologies, including fuel cells.

By joining forces with Hyundai, we can broaden our lineup, while making our R&D, logistics, design, and manufacturing teams even more effective. Put simply: together, we’re more than the sum of our parts.

When GM CEO Mary Barra signed our agreement with Hyundai a year ago, she put it well: “GM and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams. Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently.”

We’re off to a fantastic start, and I can’t wait to see where else this collaboration takes us.",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GMHyndai.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 18:08:07.189464

Certain models have been standout performers: the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai IONIQ 5 all posted record monthly sales.
The Equinox EV alone moved 8,500 units, the highest monthly sales for any non-Tesla EV in U.S. history.
We disagree with Streaty’s statement that EV sales are likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter of 2025.","Car buyers are rushing to buy new and used EVs before tariffs significantly raise all new and used vehicle prices, and federal EV tax credits expire, CNBC reported on August 8, 2025.

NBC news reported that many automakers appeared to have absorbed the tariff costs for now. But recent government data showed that retail prices for groceries, furniture and appliances started creeping up in June. GM estimated the tariffs will cost it $4 billion to $5 billion this year, and analysts expect these costs to trickle down to consumers. Foreign governments don’t pay tariffs, American consumers do. Tariffs are a tax on the American people.

Electric vehicle (EV) sales are hitting historic highs as Americans scramble to claim generous federal tax credits before they vanish at the end of September. The credits, worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs, have been a major driver of adoption in recent years. But new legislation will eliminate them after September 30.

The change comes far earlier than expected. Under the forward-thinking Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, the incentives were set to run through 2032. Their sudden expiration is fueling a last-minute buying surge that analysts say could make the third quarter of 2025 the strongest ever for EV sales.

“People are rushing out,” Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive said to CNBC. “We’re expecting Q3 may be a record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away.”

Sales Surge Across the Market

The numbers back up that prediction. In July, Americans purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs, the second-highest monthly total on record, trailing only the 136,000 sold last December. That’s a 26.4% jump from June and a nearly 20% increase compared to July 2024.

EV market share also reached a new milestone in July, representing 9.1% of all passenger vehicle sales, the highest monthly share ever recorded in the U.S.

The used EV segment is also booming. Nearly 36,700 used EVs were sold in July, setting a record monthly high. Certain models have been standout performers: the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai IONIQ 5 all posted record monthly sales. The Equinox EV alone moved 8,500 units, the highest monthly sales for any non-Tesla EV in U.S. history.

Tesla, meanwhile, has seen sales slow, with two consecutive quarterly declines, down 9% in Q1 and 12% in Q2 year-over-year.

“We’re seeing significant volume in new EVs,” Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, an EV marketplace and data provider, told CNBC.

Why the Rush to Buy?

Federal tax credits have been central to making EVs financially competitive with gasoline vehicles. In July, the average new EV sold for $55,689, while the average gasoline vehicle came in at $48,078, according to Cox Automotive data. With a $7,500 tax credit applied, an EV buyer’s effective price would be around $48,189, essentially matching the cost of a comparable gas-powered car.

According to CNBC, “The price gap between EVs and gasoline cars no longer exists,” wrote Tom Libby, analyst at S&P Global, in July. Removing the credits, he warned, “jeopardizes” EV price competitiveness.

EVs are the Most Eco-Friendly Transportation

These credits also serve a policy purpose. Transportation is the single largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and shifting from gasoline to electric is a key step in cutting climate pollution. EVs, according to MIT research, are “unambiguously better” for the environment than traditional internal combustion vehicles.

Dealers Push Urgency with Incentives

Car dealers are seizing the moment to boost sales before the September 30 cutoff. To entice buyers, dealers have been offering unusually high discounts and incentives. In July, the average new EV purchase came with about $9,800 in additional dealer incentives, roughly 17.5% of the average transaction price. That’s the highest share since October 2017, before EV adoption began to accelerate.

Importantly, the September 30 deadline isn’t just for purchase agreements, buyers must take delivery and drive the car off the lot by that date to qualify.

How Will Loss of the Credit Affect EV Sales?

Analysts expect a steep drop in EV sales during the fourth quarter of 2025 once the credits vanish, as buyers adjust to higher effective prices. However, the used EV market could remain resilient. Most current used EV buyers already don’t qualify for the $4,000 federal incentive, so its expiration won’t affect them as much. With more used EVs hitting the market and new EV prices likely rising, the pre-owned segment may even grow faster in the coming months.

The roughly 9.1% share is the highest percentage dating back to October 2017, which was before the “new era of EV adoption” when monthly sales volume was quite low, Streaty told CNBC.

EV sales are likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter of 2025, once the tax credit expires and the market adjusts to a new financial reality, Streaty said.

For now, the clock is ticking. Whether you’re eyeing a brand-new model or a used EV bargain, now until September 30 could offer the best deals you’ll see for years.

EVinfo.net’s Take: Now is the Time to Go New or Used EV

If you’ve been considering getting a new or used EV, now is the time, before federal EV tax credits expire and tariffs raise all new and used EV, hybrid and ICE prices.

We disagree with Streaty’s statement that EV sales are likely to “collapse” in the fourth quarter of 2025. We predict that there will be another EV sales growth slowdown after credits are cut, but by no means will it be a “collapse,” but rather just another sales growth slowdown, which we have seen many times before. Not a big deal at all.

I purchased an EV and got into the EV business because of being a lifelong environmentalist. Every major environmental organization worldwide supports EV adoption. The American Lung Association also supports EVs, because of the cleaner air they provide.

However, the significant cost-savings that EVs provide over time is what will move the needle for most new adopters, as the eco-conscious crowd has mostly already adopted. See how much you can save with EV savings calculators at “Electric for All” by Veloz.

When I bought a 2024 used EV recently, I didn’t get the federal credit, as used EVs must be three years old to qualify. However, I did get a $1,000.00 rebate from SDG&E, my utility provider.

CHAGRIN FALLS, Ohio (AP) — A significant share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions comes from heating, cooling and powering homes — about 15%, according to one estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. So if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, the home is an effective place to start.

There are so many factors involved in a household’s energy consumption, including whether you have gas or electric heat and how you use your kitchen appliances, washer and dryer. It’s often overwhelming to figure out where to begin.

That’s why experts recommend a home energy assessment conducted by a professional. The room-by-room examinations help homeowners determine energy use, discover inefficiencies and create a plan to reduce both. In addition to helping the environment, improving efficiency saves money over the long term.

The assessments typically last several hours and cost anywhere from $100 to more than $1,000. Until the end of the year, the Inflation Reduction Act, a major U.S. climate law passed in 2022, helps cover the cost. Congress recently rescinded many of those benefits, which will be phased out.

I’m a climate reporter, so I’ve written about responsible energy use more than a few times. But in May, after years of apartment-dwelling, I moved into the first home I’ve ever owned.

So, I signed up for a home energy assessment.

My home, outside of Cleveland, is more than 100 years old. When I blast the air conditioning, it’s still hot and humid upstairs. I can hear birds chirping outside no matter how hard I shut the windows. And there’s a giant pipe in my basement held together by duct tape and prayers.

My assessment delivered pretty bad news. But with it came with lots of room for improvement. Here’s how the day unfolded:

The HVAC tests

Tim Portman, owner of the HVAC company Portman Mechanical in northeast Ohio, started with an hourlong interview about my goals of having a more comfortable and climate-friendly house. Then he headed into the basement to test my furnace, air conditioner and water heater.

The water heater pressure was normal, so Portman said there was no major risk of a water burst. However, the pressure in both the furnace and air conditioner was too high.

Which reveals my first problem: They are too big for the duct work. That’s inefficient, and it wears on the equipment. Making matters worse, Portman noticed a bunch of unnecessary turns in the ducts.

He equated it to having great water pressure in a kinked garden hose.

“If you don’t get the kink out of that garden hose, you’re never going to have a good experience,” he said.

The highlight of my basement woes was a giant pipe that feeds heating and cooling to the rest of the house. It just … wasn’t connected. It was jammed together like two straws without a junction. It bugged him enough that he paused to fix it.

And who am I to stop him?

The blower door

After the basement, Portman assembled a contraption called a blower door. He jammed a bunch of airtight plastic in my front doorway, shoved a big fan through the middle and turned it on so that it was blowing air out of my house.

“It literally sets up a vacuum in the house. So anywhere where there are leaks, you can see where those leaks are,” he said.

Seconds later, my home got hot and musty as the fan pulled outdoor air through all the leaky seams. Portman guessed the primary culprit immediately. I followed him upstairs into what felt like a sauna near the opening to the attic.

“You literally have hot, humid air — and your attic’s warmer than outside — just pouring into the second floor,” Portman said.

The blower door measures how many cubic feet of air flow through per minute. In a well-sealed house, the number should be less than or equal to the square footage. In my 1,500 square-foot (139-square-meter) house, the blower door number was 4,500. Three times as leaky as it should be.

Portman called it a worst-case scenario.

“It’s like driving your car around with the AC on and the windows rolled down,” he said.

The thermal camera

Next, Portman grabbed a thermal camera. The goal, since it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) outside, was to see if leaks would show up as hot spots on the camera.

There were a lot. On the screen, yellow revealed a hot spot. The coolest spaces were dark blue. The leaky door frame around the attic lit up bright yellow.

“Do you think that’s a problem?” Portman joked.

“Oops,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Oops is the right answer.”

There were a few unsurprising finds, including a leaky bathroom fan and gaps around the hundred-year-old windows. Downstairs we also found major gaps in the living room’s exposed beams.

Thermal images proved Portman’s theory that my walls were not insulated. That’s because my house still has some knob and tube wiring, a system of ceramic supports and porcelain-wrapped wires that’s a relic of the early 20th century. Because of how it heats up, only certain insulation can be used with it. It can also be very expensive to remove.

In the basement, the camera revealed major gaps next to pipes and some other just … random holes. They were maybe where wiring used to be, or just hollow spots in the old wooden framing. But the air seepage was strong enough to make the cobwebs flutter frantically, as if reflecting my dread discovering them.

The verdict

After his review, Portman’s first recommendation was to call an electrician about the old wiring.

“Getting knob and tube out of your house opens the door to have insulation in your walls,” he said.

Once that’s addressed, Portman said I need to upgrade my electrical panel to support an eventual switch to a heat pump and an electric water heater, though those appliances don’t fit my budget this year.

One electrician I spoke to by phone guessed it would cost $30,000 to remove the old wiring. But another said as long as he inspects the wiring and doesn’t find any dangerous modifications, I could leave it and replace the panel for roughly $3,000.

I went with the second guy.

Through the end of 2025, federal tax credits will help subsidize weatherization upgrades, including insulation, windows, doors and electrical panels.

In the meantime, my husband and I have a different homework assignment: use a caulk gun and spray foam to plug the holes that we found on the thermal camera.

Between July heat waves and January cold snaps, sealing a house in the Cleveland area isn’t just good for the planet. It’s a good investment.

U.S. production of coal amounted to 512.1 million short tons in 2024, according to preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Earlier this week, the Trump administration approved a permit to increase coal mining by green-lighting Montana’s Rosebud Mine, which the Department of the Interior says ""enables the recovery of approximately 33.75 million tons of federal coal and extends the mine’s operation through 2039.""

The move represents the fourth time in Trump’s second term that a coal mining permit has been granted or extended, including three new permits and one permit expansion.

Other sites opened up include Hurricane Creek Mining, in Tennessee, a project the administration says could produce up to 1.8 million tons of coal over the next 10 years and create 24 local jobs, and Navajo Transitional Energy Company in Montana, which enables the production of 39.9 million tons of federal coal and creation of 280 full-time jobs.

The two other sites are in Montana in the form of the Spring Creek Mine, which supplies coal to states across the country in addition to Japan and South Korea, and Signal Peak Energy, which had its mining plan modification at the Bull Mountains coal mine approved by DOI in June.

Additionally, the DOI has ended the moratorium on coal leasing and reopened federal lands in states including Montana and Wyoming. In April, President Trump signed a proclamation granting relief from Biden-era coal regulations and signed an executive order backing the coal industry.

In one of the executive orders, the president instructed the National Energy Dominance Council’s head to ""designate coal as a ‘mineral’ under Executive Order 14241,"" a measure Trump signed in March that the White House said at the time would ""boost American mineral production"" and ""streamline permitting.""

Reclassifying coal as a mineral ""opened up the door to speed up the permitting process"" and ""make more federal lands eligible for producing coal,"" according to Price Futures Group senior market analyst and FOX Business contributor Phil Flynn.

""It also opens coal production and usage to a whole wide range of financial incentives, loans and subsidies that can support the production and exporting [of] U.S. coal,"" he told FOX Business. ""This is going to make coal more competitive with other fuel sources and will be a positive, because U.S. production of coal is cleaner than other countries and our use of coal is also cleaner and better for the environment as well.""

The administration is also touting 13 other projects that are currently at various stages in the permitting process including 8 Lease by Applications and 5 Lease Modification Applications.

The administration also says that under former President Biden, no new coal permits were granted and touted the president’s efforts in a statement to Fox News Digital.

A Jeff Bezos-backed startup aims to appeal to American car buyers’ patriotism and pocketbooks.

Slate Auto plans to debut a small electric-powered, American-made pickup for less than $20,000 with federal subsidies. [Note: This Bloomberg article was published before the budget and tax bill became law. The Senate passed it on July 1, the House of Representatives passed it on July 3, and President Donald Trump signed it into law on July 4.] The bare bones, two-seater truck is designed to make a splash in a market where demand for EVs has softened — due in part to high prices that Cox Automotive estimates averaged $59,205 in March, 25% more than a gas vehicle.

The startup, which counts Amazon.com founder Bezos among its key investors, is headquartered in the Detroit suburb of Troy, Michigan, and employs about 400 people, Jeff Jablansky, a company spokesman, said Friday.

Its base model lacks creature comforts like power windows and the battery — which Korean Economic Daily reports is supplied by SK On Co. — has a maximum range of about 240 miles. It will be assembled at a plant in Indiana, the company said, with the first vehicles delivered as soon as late 2026. Kits will be sold separately to modify the truck into a SUV.

“The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” Chris Barman, Slate’s chief executive officer, said at an event late Thursday. “We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered.”

The low sticker price relies on EV tax incentives President Donald Trump aims to eliminate. Slate Auto’s spokesman said the truck will still be competitive and affordable without such federal support, but he did not specify a price without those incentives.

Multiple Hurricane Helene aid programs in North Carolina are clearing key bureaucratic hurdles, state officials said Friday, as thousands in the mountains await help for their homes and farms nearly one year after the storm.

A new state fund created to reimburse farmers for lost crops has received more than 7,000 applications. And Renew NC, the state’s home building and repair program, is one step closer to funding after a key agreement with federal officials this week.

State lawmakers created the crop reimbursement program as part of a March aid bill. It sets out $300 million to pay farmers for crops that were washed away or destroyed last year. Two-thirds of that money is for Helene-impacted farms, and the rest is for other storms in 2024.

Applications for the program closed in May. The Department of Agriculture received around 7,500 applications total when accounting for incomplete or duplicate ones, assistant commissioner Kaleb Rathbone told the governor’s committee on western recovery.

In the months since, officials have sought to verify all of those applications. Farms will be reimbursed for their losses based on a formula outlined in state law. Payment is expected “mid-summer,” according to the department’s website.

“We can’t send money out for a category until we’ve reviewed and calculated the payments, so that nobody gets left behind,” Rathbone said.

The vast majority of applications — around 6,400 — are for farms affected by storms other than Helene. Of the roughly 1,100 Helene-impacted applicants, 500 of them involve farm infrastructure damage.

Applications remain open through the end of the year, meanwhile, for the state’s primary homebuilding and repair program, Renew NC.

Many home repairs out west have already begun — paid for by a combination of homeowners’ own capital, FEMA’s individual assistance payments and philanthropic groups. But Renew NC will be the state’s biggest effort at restoring damaged homes, primarily for low-income families.

Thus far, only single-family housing is open to applications. The state has received 920 applications so far, said Matt Calabria, director of the governor’s recovery office. Around 350 of those have been deemed eligible and will now move into scheduled inspections.

State officials do not yet have access to the $1.4 billion in federal grant funds that will fuel the program. But they signed an agreement with federal officials this week, Calabria said, a key step toward unlocking the money. Other requirements remain, like environmental reviews, before the money is made available.

But Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, brought one of its SU7 sedans to Detroit for 6 months of testing. When it was time to return the car to China, Farley said he didn’t want to part with it. Readers may recall that another SU7 — a prototype known as the SU7 Ultra — set a new lap record for 4-door sedans at the Nurburgring earlier this year, hitting speeds of more than 200 mph on the straights. High praise from Farley, and record setting performance in Germany. Clearly, Xiaomi has built a “compelling electric car,” as Elon Musk begged manufacturers to do a decade ago.

Which raises the question, why did Xiaomi succeed where Apple failed? The New York Times dug into that question earlier this year, and the answer reveals a great deal about what it will take for companies to be successful in the auto manufacturing business in the future and how that business is changing.

The first conclusion that Times reporters Meaghan Tobin and Claire Fu came to was that the “ability to succeed where Apple could not shows how thoroughly China has come to dominate the supply chain for electric vehicles. Chinese companies have mastered electric vehicle manufacturing. By tapping that infrastructure, Xiaomi was able to get components quickly and cheaply.”

Xiaomi & Government Subsidies

Many people complain that Chinese EV manufacturers have benefited from billions of dollars in government support. That level of government assistance has helped them gain control of the supply chain, down to the very minerals inside the batteries of electric cars — car batteries. That in turn has made it possible for BYD and CATL to become the biggest electric battery makers in the world. Those complaints are typified by a comment to the Times story that said, “China has a near slave workforce which are forced to live, sleep and eat in company dormitories 24/7. Their lives revolve around long work shifts and manufacturing output. They have no civil rights under the Chinese government. Their economy isn’t like ours with capitalist freedom. This is why they can dominate any industry they target.”

Such comments are heard frequently when talking about China, but they ignore a couple of important items. First, the US has subsidized many industries by allowing them to avoid the costs of cleaning up the toxic messes they leave in their wake. Such measures are now seen as government overreach. Second, the US invented lithium-ion battery technology, solar panel technology, and computer chip technology via government subsidies, but never followed up on them, preferring to allow others to capitalize on those early breakthroughs. To complain now that others have taken that ball and run with it while the US was mesmerized by horizontal drilling techniques and fracking the Earth to a faretheewell is disingenuous at best.

Third, the US is pretty good at using government to promote new industries when it wants to. The proof is in the $90 billion this failed administration has promised to tech billionaires so they can dominate artificial intelligence. But doing so will require something the US has chosen to de-emphasize — education. As another Times commenter put it, “The supply chain is a long chain of human ingenuity and relations. It is not a mechanical robot who produces [cars]. The US does not have the educated and motivated laborers to do this kind of job, quickly on a large scale.”

Our national preference for ignorance will do more to hobble the US economy in the future than any supposed assistance the Chinese government gives to its domestic manufacturers. In fact, China operates on a much more rigorous form of capitalism than the US ever thought about. It does not bail out those who fail; they simply go out of business. It doesn’t get any more efficient in the allocation of capital than that, though the results can have brutal consequences for those who fail.

Xiaomi Is More Than A Car Company

But there is more to the story. Xiaomi is not primarily a car company. It makes a number of electronic devices, from robot vacuum cleaners to air conditioners. All of them, including the SU7, share the Xiaomi operating system and are controlled by the company’s app. “The SU7 is, in some ways, just another gadget. It can use data collected from other devices about a driver’s daily routine to determine the best time to charge the car’s batteries,” the Times reports. “Xiaomi has really started infiltrating your home,” said Gary Ng, an economist with Natixis Corporate & Investment Banking. “Everything is linked together, and this is something other companies couldn’t do.”

Xiaomi’s experience gained in the manufacture of many consumer products has allowed it to surpass many traditional automakers in China. It makes it possible for the company to bring new models to market quickly and focus on making software that they can continually update, said Stephen W. Dyer, head of Asia Automotive at AlixPartners, a consultancy.

Intense competition at home has pushed many Chinese carmakers to explore export markets in order to absorb some of their excess production. It is just a matter of time before Xiaomi begins to sell its cars outside of China, said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.

Xiaomi’s popularity as a maker of all kinds of consumer electronics gave it a deep well of knowledge about Chinese consumer preferences. On the first day SU7s were delivered, buyers could go to Xiaomi’s app store and get accessories to personalize their cars — things like analog clocks for their dashboards or a row of physical switches that attach to a touchscreen panel. “The strength of the brand puts Xiaomi ahead of a lot of their competitors,” said Tu Le, a managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights. “That’s what it takes to sell cars globally, because it’s not just a consumer product, it’s an emotional product.”

For any sales professionals, that last thought is telling. People buy on emotion and justify their decision later with facts. A company that understands that first principal of sales has a big head start on the competition. Xiaomi found a way to make that connection; Apple did not. And thereby hangs a tale.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-Xiaomi-SU7-Ultra-crop.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 16:02:51.528223

(AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/09/As-electric-bills-rise-evidence-mounts-that-data-centers-share-blame.-States-feel-pressure-to-act-scaled-e1754765270582.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 16:04:18.414432

In 2019, they made the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) a focal point, which promised a green-energy utopia. At the same time, they used their power to shutter energy plants, like Dunkirk NRG. The result, is that New York was left with an aging, shrinking power supply and no realistic plan to meet growing demand.

According to NYISO’s 2025 Power Trends Report, New York is losing generating capacity and still relying on plants built during the Carter and Reagan years. While our state government promotes and subsidizes renewable energy our energy supply is becoming more compromised. Wind and Solar combined provide less than 6 percent of our electricity.

New York’s energy price fixing scheme is expensive and irresponsible, but it is also increasingly intolerable. As our government imposes mandates for electric cars, buses, trucks and home heating, while knowing full well our grid can’t handle the load. They’ve driven away investment in reliable gas and oil plants, suffocated projects with red tape, and left families footing the bill for skyrocketing energy costs. This isn’t leadership. It’s negligence. And it’s dangerous.

If our Governor and State Legislature had been honest, they would have admitted years ago that New York simply doesn’t have the electricity supply to meet their radical mandates. Instead, they’ve gambled with our economy, our wallets and our safety, and June 24 showed just how close that gamble came to failure. It doesn’t have to be this way.

We should hit pause on the push for total electrification until we have the power to support it. We should invest in common-sense energy efficiency, like weatherizing homes to cut bills and reduce demand. We should modernize our existing plants with cleaner, more efficient technology instead of letting 50-year-old generators limp along until they break. And we must embrace every available source of reliable energy, including nuclear, natural gas and next- generation technologies, without Albany’s endless bureaucratic roadblocks.

Albany Democrats have had six years to get this right. The warning lights are flashing. If we don’t change course now, the next time the grid falters, it may not just be a warning, it may be the lights going out.

PLI Scheme Spurs Growth in Integrated Solar Manufacturing

As of June 30, 2025, data from manufacturers and the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) shows the PLI scheme has helped establish:

*18.5 GW of solar module capacity

*9.7 GW of solar cell capacity

*2.2 GW of ingot-wafer capacity

This reflects a significant step toward building an end-to-end solar PV manufacturing ecosystem in the country.

Phased Implementation Underway

The minister noted that timelines for operationalising awarded capacities depend on several factors, including land acquisition, financial closure, equipment procurement, and installation timelines.

Leading Companies Driving First and Second Tranches

Under the first tranche of the PLI scheme, Letters of Award have been issued to:

*Shirdi Sai Electricals

*Reliance Industries

*Adani New Industries

Together, they are developing 8.737 GW of fully integrated solar PV module manufacturing units. In the second tranche, 11 successful bidders have secured approvals to establish 39.6 GW of fully or partially integrated solar PV manufacturing facilities across India.

National Capacity Expands, Eyes 42 GW by 2026

India’s total installed solar cell manufacturing capacity currently stands at 26.35 GW, with plans to expand this to approximately 42 GW by June 1, 2026, the MNRE confirmed. This aggressive scale-up supports India’s broader clean energy transition and aims to make the country a global manufacturing hub for solar technologies.

Reducing Import Dependence

The PLI scheme has already started to reduce India’s reliance on imported solar modules. According to Commerce Ministry data, India’s solar module imports declined from USD 3.36 billion in FY2022 to USD 2.15 billion in FY2025—a clear indicator of rising domestic capability.

Policy Measures Backing Local Manufacturing

To further support Indian manufacturers, the government has taken several decisive steps. Mandated use of domestically manufactured modules for schemes such as:

*CPSU Scheme Phase-II

*PM-KUSUM Components B & C

*PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana

*Imposed Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on imported solar PV cells and modules

*Exempted customs duties on select inputs used by domestic solar manufacturers",https://chemindigest.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PLI-Scheme-Powers-Solar-Manufacturing-to-18.6-GW-Capacity.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:08:08.630971

Gas demand is beginning to boom thanks to the electricity feeding frenzy from data centers, skyrocketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and the ongoing retirements of aging coal plants being replaced by relatively cleaner-burning gas.
“Now we’re talking about power and data centers and LNG essentially doubling over the next few years.
For instance, since mid-June, natural gas prices and stock values have slumped a bit because of milder weather and rising gas storage levels.
“It’s a pretty exciting time for natural gas,” said Expand CEO Nick Dell’Osso in the second-quarter earnings call.","Natural gas has always been the overlooked little brother to crude oil that drives the fossil fuel industry dating back to the famed Drake Well in 1859 in Pennsylvania, which launched the U.S. oil and gas industry.

The dynamics have changed now—especially in the heart of the gassy Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. Gas demand is beginning to boom thanks to the electricity feeding frenzy from data centers, skyrocketing liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and the ongoing retirements of aging coal plants being replaced by relatively cleaner-burning gas.

Many of the nation’s top gas producers, including Expand Energy, EQT, Range Resources, and Antero Resources, all have major Appalachian footprints and market cap values that have spiked by 25% to 75% the past 12 months.

Meanwhile, crude oil-weighted stocks are almost all down, mired in a prolonged slump of middling pricing, weaker demand growth, and surging OPEC production hikes.

“With the resource-rich potential in this [Marcellus] basin and the growing demand component for AI and data centers and power, it really is setting us up well to help shape this AI revolution that’s going to take place here in the United States,” Range Resources CEO and President Dennis Degner told Fortune.

A decade ago, the gas industry’s fortunes focused on seasonality and how cold each winter would prove, Degner said. “Now we’re talking about power and data centers and LNG essentially doubling over the next few years. Those are all big, diverse demand components that really get us excited about the durability of our business model.”

The Appalachian region—primarily the Marcellus and Utica shale plays in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio—produces just over one-third of the nation’s gas—and very little oil—with proximity to Virginia’s growing Data Center Alley and, now, more AI infrastructure expected within Appalachia.

After a couple of decades during which U.S. power demand remained relatively stagnant, domestic electricity consumption is expected to surge by 25% from 2023 to 2035 and roughly 60% from 2023 to 2050, driven largely by AI and data centers, according to the International Energy Agency.

Likewise, record-high LNG exports will roughly double by 2030. Based on new construction underway or greenlit along the U.S. Gulf Coast, LNG exports are expected to rise from 15 billion cubic feet per day in 2024 to at least 30 billion daily by the end of 2030.

“It’s really night and day when you look at the gas names versus the oil names,” said Gabriele Sorbara, energy analyst at Siebert Williams Shank & Co. “The fundamentals for gas are very strong. You’re going to have massive tailwinds.”

Appalachia’s tech boom

Antero chairman and CEO Paul Rady said in his earnings statement that the industry now expects natural gas demand to soar 25% by 2030, led by LNG growth and then by data center power thirst.

That’s an astonishing jump for a U.S. sector that pumps out 107 billion cubic feet of gas per day—already double the amount since the nation’s shale gas boom kicked off 20 years ago.

The top gas producers are all exceeding their production estimates this year with goals to continue ramping up for at least the next two or three years. But they’re doing it without huge spending hikes because of the operational efficiencies gained through drilling and completing wells.

Range Resources, for instance, aims to grow its production 20% by the end of 2027. But Range is doing it while only operating two drilling rigs. For comparison, Big Oil giant and leading Permian Basin producer Exxon Mobil has at least 35 rigs operating in the huge West Texas oil basin.

“These [Marcellus] wells are just massive,” Sorbara said.

Instead, the question marks focus on the exact extent of demand growth, the timing, and the gas pricing, making gas players relatively conservative when it comes to ramping up production, building new pipelines, and inking fixed-pricing deals with data center developers.

For instance, since mid-June, natural gas prices and stock values have slumped a bit because of milder weather and rising gas storage levels. But that’s not slowing the bullishness.

Range sends about half of its Pennsylvania gas toward the U.S. Gulf Coast and LNG exports but, because of pipeline constraints, additional growth is almost all coming from regional data center demand.

In July, Trump touted $92 billion in energy and AI investments in Pennsylvania from hyperscalers, power generators and more. Range, for instance, has a new partnership with Imperial Land industrial park developer in Pennsylvania to fuel new gas-fired power generation for data centers.

Pennsylvania’s Homer City complex will soon become the nation’s largest gas-fired power plant. The massive 1.9 coal plant east of Pittsburgh is being converted to natural gas with up to 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity to serve a sprawling data center campus.

The largest Marcellus gas producer, EQT, recently inked deals to provide gas to Homer City and to Pennsylvania’s planned Shippingport Power Station, also being converted from coal. And EQT is providing pipelines services to fuel planned gas plants in West Virginia in the heart of coal country.

“The cluster effect of these AI data centers and these ecosystems will only continue to build on themselves,” EQT CEO Toby Rice said in his earnings call. “As momentum grows in our operational footprint, we think the opportunity could get larger.

“One of the reasons why people are selecting this region to build their data centers is because they’re building on top of a lot of gas infrastructure,” he added.

There may be a current bottleneck on gas turbines for building power plants, but manufacturing is ramping up and most of the hyperscalers’ projects are a few years from coming online.

The nation’s top natural gas producer is little-known Expand Energy because it was formed just 10 months ago through the combination of Chesapeake Energy and Southwestern Energy. Expand has huge presences in both Appalachia and northern Louisiana’s gassy Haynesville Shale near the LNG hubs.

“It’s a pretty exciting time for natural gas,” said Expand CEO Nick Dell’Osso in the second-quarter earnings call. “You have people recognizing the value that gas plays in the economy, the efficiency that gas creates for the growth in power demand, which is all tied to our growing economy fueled by the innovation associated with AI.”

The gas players are increasingly confident they’re not going to boom and bust. The Marcellus has ample reserves for decades so long as they don’t overproduce.

“We can do this for decades to come, and now you’re talking about a [data center] demand component that’s coming that’s heavily dependent on reliability, repeatability, and the [gas] inventory,” Range’s Degner told Fortune. Of course, Range thrives on all three, he emphasized.

By 2023, natural gas and coal exports exceeded the region’s imports, with export values reaching 29 million tonnes of natural gas equivalent and 146 million tonnes of coal equivalent, respectively.

For fossil fuel companies and lenders to the fossil fuel industry, retiring those assets early would require them to forego cash flows.
ASEAN leaders must increase the share of green energy in the ASEAN Power Grid initiative.","As Southeast Asian countries undertake their 2025 Nationally Determined Contribution climate action plans, the region stands at a pivotal moment. The question is whether ASEAN leaders will seize this opportunity to accelerate renewable energy deployment or whether they will reinforce their reliance on fossil fuels.

The global energy landscape is experiencing a seismic shift. Since 2021, electricity generation from coal and gas has remained stagnant, while solar power generation has grown significantly, signalling a decisive move towards clean electricity as ageing fossil fuel plants phase out. At the heart of this transformation is China’s manufacturing dominance in solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and batteries, positioning the nation as a central force in the global green energy supply chain.

But Southeast Asia has relied heavily on fossil fuels to power its development. Only 15.6 per cent of ASEAN’s total primary energy supply was renewable energy in 2022. For a more balanced perspective, it is worth noting that in ASEAN, the cost of electricity from hydro, solar and geothermal is becoming cheaper than bioenergy and coal, reflecting a growing momentum in the power sector. In the region, solar power capacity increased from 11 gigawatts in 2019 to 26 gigawatts in 2023. But coal remained dominant in the region’s energy mix, accounting for 30.5 per cent and natural gas — often cited as a ‘transition’ fuel — contributed 19.7 per cent.

Despite early calls for a phase-down, baseline scenario projections forecast that coal and natural gas will remain substantial components of ASEAN’s energy mix up until 2050 — though the region can expect advancements in renewable energy technologies, declining costs and growing renewable energy investments.

Southeast Asia is emerging as a significant exporter of liquefied natural gas and coal. By 2023, natural gas and coal exports exceeded the region’s imports, with export values reaching 29 million tonnes of natural gas equivalent and 146 million tonnes of coal equivalent, respectively. The region ranks among the top global liquefied natural gas exporters, shipping to China, Japan and South Korea.

But while ASEAN is projected to become a net importer of natural gas by 2027, coal exports are anticipated to continue until at least 2050, though their balance will likely decline.

ASEAN governments are caught between safeguarding the revenues they raise from coal and gas exports — and preparing for when those markets dry up or become costly imports — and reaching for a cleaner, more secure future.

Yet the human and environmental costs of continued fossil fuel reliance grow harder to ignore. Cities like Jakarta and Bangkok wake up under haze while farmers in the Mekong Delta watch fisheries collapse as river ecosystems experience both drought and flood. Without targeted and systematic decarbonisation efforts, climate events are expected to increase in frequency and severity.

But change is not easy. For fossil fuel companies and lenders to the fossil fuel industry, retiring those assets early would require them to forego cash flows.

Renewable energy investment in ASEAN is influenced by factors including costs, environmental awareness, social norms, energy consumption habits and the attribution of responsibility for environmental outcomes.

Yet, there is reason for cautious optimism. Sun and wind resources are abundant in Southeast Asia and solar panel and wind turbine costs continue to fall. Ambitious targets already exist — ASEAN aims to lift renewable capacity to 35 per cent in installed power capacity by 2025, a goal that would require a 15 per cent jump from the region’s post-Paris baseline. If ASEAN governments hold firm on policies like competitive auctions, feed-in tariffs and streamlined permitting, they could unleash a wave of investment in renewables.

On the finance side, new partnerships are taking shape. Blended finance models — mixing concessional loans from development banks with private capital — can lower risks for early renewable projects. Indonesia and Vietnam are adopting Just Energy Transition Partnership financing packages despite the United States’ withdrawal from these agreements leading to a reduction in funding. With well-structured deals, coal sector workers can access retraining programs and social support, while stranded asset funds buy out plants and channel resources into green industries.

But a truly regional approach could be most potent. ASEAN leaders must increase the share of green energy in the ASEAN Power Grid initiative. By harmonising regulations and sharing research and development on battery storage between member states’ business sectors, ASEAN countries can smooth variable output and cut costs for everyone. Joint procurement of panels, turbines and pumped hydro could deliver bulk discounts — just as the European Union does in various sectors. Operationalising Article 6 of the Paris Agreement by establishing a regional carbon market mechanism would enable member states to mobilise climate finance.

As countries sharpen their climate pledges in the run-up to COP30 in Belem, they should enshrine precise coal phase-out dates, stop developing new coal power plants and establish firm renewable energy ratio targets. Stronger Nationally Determined Contributions would not only signal global ambition but unlock new pools of multilateral funding and spur domestic reforms that would boost investor confidence.

Southeast Asian leaders’ decisions will determine whether the region can break free from the chains of fossil fuel dependency and join the global renewable energy movement to achieve the ASEAN 2045 Vision.

Kwatra also said that he held a discussion with Graham on increasing energy trade with Washington.

“Spoke to Senator @LindseyGrahamSC and shared with him the Indian perspective on our energy security, including increasing energy trade with the United States,"" the Indian envoy said in a post on X.

It is noteworthy that Graham was one of the Senators who had issued warnings to countries doing business with Russia that US President Donald Trump would impose massive tariffs on their goods.

In an interview with Fox News, the US senator had said, “Trump is going to impose tariffs on people that buy Russian oil—China, India, and Brazil,"" arguing that the countries were helping fund the war in Ukraine as they accounted for around 80 per cent of Russia’s crude exports.

“If you keep buying cheap Russian oil to allow this war to continue, we will tariff the hell out of you. And we’re going to crush your economy, because what you are doing is blood money,"" he added.

His warning had come weeks before Trump’s 25% reciprocal tariff announcement for India. The US President intensified his tirade against New Delhi later, with an additional 25% tariff announcement for buying Russian oil. While the reciprocal tariffs have come into force, the additional duties will take effect starting August 27.

Meanwhile, India has defended its energy strategy, saying that its crude oil purchases from Russia are “a necessity compelled by global market conditions"" and not a political endorsement of Moscow.

It further asserted that the country will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security.

“India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,"" the statement said, underlining the country’s commitment to stable and affordable energy access for its citizens.

The MEA termed the levies as “unjustified and unreasonable"" and called out the double standards of the United States and the European Union over their trade ties with Russia. The statement highlighted that the US continues to import uranium hexafluoride from Russia for its nuclear industry.

CARMEL — Indiana electric cooperative lineworkers are traveling to Guatemala today to re-energize approximately 670 homes in seven villages in Central Guatemala as part of an international initiative to bring electricity to developing areas in Guatemala.

“Project Indiana: Empowering Global Communities for a Better Tomorrow” will bring electricity to a part of the Central American country where it has been out of service for nearly two years.

The crew will spend August 8 through 17 inspecting and repairing the electric distribution system that provides electricity to the homes served by the Coopersa cooperative in Guatemala. This region’s power is produced by a hydro generator that was built approximately 20 to 25 years ago and has been inoperable for approximately two years.

Over the last year, Project Indiana has worked with the cooperative and a local business with industry expertise to pinpoint the problem, identify funding sources, order the necessary parts and facilitate the repair.

The electric distribution system in one of the seven villages served by this cooperative — Sepamac — was first built in 2015 by a crew of Indiana electric cooperative lineworkers.

The project crew is composed of:

Jamie Bell, NineStar Connect.

Ethan DeWitt, Northeastern REMC.

Clint Heeke, Southern Indiana Power.

Cody Campbell, South Central Indiana REMC.

This is Indiana electric cooperatives’ seventh trip to Guatemala. In August 2012, 28 Hoosier lineworkers from 17 of Indiana’s electric cooperatives spent four weeks working across the mountainous terrain to bring electricity to 184 homes, a church and a school in three villages.

In April 2015, 14 lineworkers battled extreme heat and the rugged land to bring electricity to 164 homes, a school and a church. In 2017, 14 lineworkers endured extreme temperatures to power 68 homes, a school, a church and a health clinic.

In 2019, 14 lineworkers brought electricity to nearly 90 homes, two churches, and a school and ensured that every home they wired for electricity had a properly vented wood-burning cooking stove installed to replace the open fires villagers have used for years. In 2023, 14 lineworkers brought electricity to 26 homes and a school.

Because clean energy projects are being deployed worldwide, costs are plummeting, helping drive further growth and adoption.
China leads the world in solar power and generation, with more than 830 terawatt-hours of electricity produced in 2024, per Ember Energy.
António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, stressed the urgency for tech giants to switch to clean energy to power their operations by 2030.
The sun is rising on a clean energy age,"" Guterres said at a recent conference.","Dirty fuels could be on their way out sooner than we think. As the cost of renewable technologies continues to drop, the United Nations secretary-general believes a society powered by sustainable energy is on the horizon.

As The Guardian reported, a recent analysis by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that over 90% of renewable energy projects are more cost-effective than their fossil fuel counterparts. In 2024, renewables helped avoid nearly $470 billion in dirty fuel costs, signifying their capacity to promote a cleaner, safer world and boost energy security.

Because clean energy projects are being deployed worldwide, costs are plummeting, helping drive further growth and adoption. China leads the world in solar power and generation, with more than 830 terawatt-hours of electricity produced in 2024, per Ember Energy. It also dominates the market for solar panel manufacturing and exports, supplying a large portion of the world's solar panels.

All this growth is spurring large investments in clean energy, with The Guardian reporting that investors contributed a staggering $2 trillion last year, representing a 70% increase over the last 10 years.

At the same time, energy demands are soaring in part because people are using more air conditioning as the climate warms and because of the tremendous growth of data centers to power artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. António Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, stressed the urgency for tech giants to switch to clean energy to power their operations by 2030.

Meanwhile, billions of dollars in subsidies are still given to fossil fuel giants, but Guterres is optimistic that society will wean itself off polluting fuels sooner rather than later as renewables become more cost-competitive. Along with being better for the economy, clean energy is a major win for the public, as it leads to improved health as well as job creation and investment opportunities for individuals and firms alike.

According to the Department of Energy, the global market for renewable energies is expected to be worth around $23 trillion by 2030, which translates to ""millions of well-paying, stable jobs, creating a reliable, lower-cost domestic supply chain, and supporting opportunities in communities across the country.""

Fossil fuel stocks have been underperforming for at least a decade, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, and while green energy stocks are volatile because of interest rate fluctuations and changes in government policies, the long-term outlook for renewable energy remains positive.

""We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age,"" Guterres said at a recent conference.

Bill Hare, founder and CEO of Climate Analytics, a global climate science and policy institute, added, ""Any investment in new fossil fuels now is a fool's gamble, while joining the race to renewables can only bring benefits — not just jobs and cheaper energy at stable prices, but energy independence and access where it's needed most.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/renewable-energyimage-rec6nPEaDtrmvTTwg.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 14:05:52.322818

For two years in a row, PJM’s process for ensuring the grid has sufficient power plant capacity has resulted in record high prices, which will get passed on to consumers. The results are tied to rising electricity demand for data centers and a bottleneck in approving grid connections for new projects.

Almost everything about these events is bound up in layers of complexity.

To explain what’s happening, my colleague Rambo Talabong put together some charts and I spoke with energy policy experts. Together, we aim to make this situation understandable.

PJM, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, oversees the grid and electricity markets in a territory that stretches from New Jersey to Chicago. The organization has roots in a 1920s partnership between utilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

“It’s a bunch of utilities who have come together and said, ‘We can provide more reliable, less expensive electric service to customers if we work together and have a mutual aid pact,'” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has a background working in utility regulation and the energy industry. “When a customer in New Jersey can buy power from a power plant in New Jersey, or a power plant in Pennsylvania or a power plant in Ohio, it’s going to be cheaper than if they were just buying from power plants from New Jersey.”

One of the ways PJM manages its system is by holding an auction in which power plant owners compete to see who will offer the lowest prices to be available to the grid at all times.

The result is a “capacity price,” which is the price set to ensure that there are enough resources to meet the region’s needs on the hottest days of summer. The price sets the level of payments to participating power plants, which is an important income source for them in addition to what they make from selling electricity.

Last year, the auction produced a result so unusual that this topic, usually reserved for the business press, became general news. The new price, which took effect two months ago, was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an increase from $28.92 per megawatt-day in the previous delivery year.

The most recent auction was last month, yielding an even higher price, $329.17 per megawatt-day. This price will take effect next June.

Since a megawatt-day (which is 24 megawatt-hours) is a unit that most people don’t use or understand, it’s easier to put these results in terms of how many billions of dollars power plant owners stand to receive in aggregate. The change from two years ago is dizzying, going from a low of $2.2 billion to the most recent result of $16.1 billion.

Governors across PJM territory have voiced their displeasure. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said, “What PJM has laid out is a slap in the face.”

Why did costs go up so much? There are many reasons, but the main one is that electricity demand is soaring, largely due to the development of data centers. The upward curve in PJM’s long-term forecast is in contrast to the prior decade-plus of flat growth.

“Supply and demand,” said Daniel Lockwood, a PJM spokesman, when asked about the reasons for rising costs. “Unprecedented and continuing growth in demand from the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.”

Silverman from Johns Hopkins agreed that this is, by far, the leading factor.

When demand is flat, old and inefficient power plants often struggle to compete, leading plant owners to close the plants that are losing money or barely profitable. Since 2000, PJM has seen a shift as coal-fired power plants reached the end of their lives and were replaced by natural gas plants and some renewables.

The retirement of old coal plants was good for the environment, but the rapid loss of those plants has helped to intensify the supply crunch that’s now happening.

But plant retirements are only part of the picture.

One of the reasons PJM is struggling to secure enough power plant capacity is the organization’s challenges in connecting new plants to the grid.

PJM has an online queue in which owners of prospective power plants get in line to gain approval to hook up to interstate power lines. Ideally, this would be a fast process, but the queue has turned into a quagmire of long waits, meaning the grid isn’t getting some of the new power plants that would otherwise be ready.

Most of the affected projects are solar arrays, the results of a solar boom across much of PJM territory.

Some caveats: Some of the projects in the queue are highly speculative and unlikely to get built, so the numbers can be misleading. Also, some projects are held back by more than just PJM, with challenges getting local permits and other factors.

As of June, there were 63 gigawatts of projects waiting in PJM’s interconnection process that should be completed by the end of 2026, according to Lockwood, the PJM spokesman. He noted that there are 46 gigawatts of projects that have agreements to plug into the grid today, but some aren’t being built because of factors beyond PJM’s control, such as siting, permitting and financing.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have said PJM often acts as an obstacle to reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

“The power grid operator’s policy decisions too often favor outdated, expensive power plants and needlessly block low-cost clean energy resources and battery projects from connecting to the grid and bringing down prices,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, in a statement. “This extended price spike was preventable.”

So, how much is a household’s electricity bill rising because of all this?

I asked several of the largest utilities in PJM for specifics. Their answers had wide variations, which helps to show differences in rate structures, state regulations and other factors that affect how and when the PJM charges reach consumers.

PSEG, the largest utility in New Jersey, notified customers in February of an impending 17 percent rate increase that was largely due to the rise in PJM charges. As of June, a household using 650 kilowatt-hours per month now paid $183, which was $27 more than before.

ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has increased its residential bills by roughly 10 percent because of the surge in PJM charges that took effect in June. A typical household, which uses 609 kilowatt-hours per month, is paying $117, which is $11 more than before.

Dominion, which is the largest utility in Virginia and also has PJM customers in North Carolina, said its customers were largely insulated from PJM costs because the company gets most of its electricity from power plants that it owns. This is different from most large utilities in PJM, which do not directly own power plants and use market-based systems to obtain electricity for customers.

The total monthly cost for PJM capacity, even after the increase, would be less than $2 per month, according to a Dominion spokesman.

Just like PJM’s capacity prices have gone up, they can come back down. But for that to happen, some of the market fundamentals will need to change. I don’t expect that to happen any time soon.

So you’re probably going to keep hearing about PJM in the context of explanations for high electricity prices.

GM will import Chinese batteries despite Trump’s tariffs

General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, is moving forward with its plans to import electric vehicle (EV) batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) to power the upcoming version of its Chevrolet Bolt.

According to sources familiar with the matter, GM will rely on CATL’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for around two years, while its battery manufacturing joint venture with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution prepares to begin local production of the same battery type in Tennessee by 2027.

The new generation Bolt, which General Motors plans to begin assembling at its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas later this year, will arrive in dealerships in 2026. It will be the most affordable electric vehicle in GM’s lineup, priced at around $30,000.

Despite the 80% tariff on Chinese EV batteries, GM views the arrangement as a necessary measure to keep its pricing competitive and its production timelines on track.

“For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,” General Motors said in a statement. “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model.”

Auto maker has to handle cost pressures and tax policy

According to Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Telemetry, LFP batteries are roughly 35% cheaper to produce than nickel- and cobalt-based alternatives.

LFP battery chemistry was first developed in the U.S. in the late 1990s, but Chinese companies like CATL and BYD have since commercialized and dominated the production and supply of these batteries.

Ford, GM’s key rival, is currently licensing CATL’s LFP technology and manufacturing process for a new factory in Michigan. That facility will supply batteries for a planned small electric pickup truck.

Tesla previously used CATL’s LFP batteries in some Model 3 units until it ceased the arrangement following an escalation in U.S. tariffs earlier this year.

Currently, GM sources batteries for all 12 of its EV models, including the $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV and the $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq from U.S.-based manufacturing. None of those vehicles utilizes the cheaper LFP chemistry.

The adoption of these cost-effective batteries, coupled with other efficiencies General Motors has achieved in EV production, could allow the new Bolt to be “marginally profitable” or “close enough,” even with the tariff burden.

Adding further rationale to GM’s move, the U.S. EV tax credit policy that provided a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases will be scrapped starting next month. Previously, the new Bolt would have been ineligible for the incentive due to the use of Chinese-made batteries, but with the credit now eliminated for all qualifying vehicles, GM’s Bolt will no longer be at a comparative disadvantage in the marketplace.

The Bolt was first introduced in 2016 and discontinued in 2023. The model is expected to make a comeback as part of GM’s goal to expand affordable EV options. A board member, Jon McNeill, hinted that the Bolt could be put on sale in the low $20,000s after factoring in the tax credit. With the incentive gone, the base price is expected to settle around $30,000.

Speaking at its Institutional Investors Meeting for Q1 FY26, the company outlined its goal to increase module manufacturing capacity from 10 GW to 26 GW and solar cell capacity from 5.4 GW to 16 GW by FY27.

The expansion blueprint also includes establishing 10 GW of ingot-wafer capacity, a 3.5 GWh battery energy storage system (BESS) facility, 3 GW inverter production, and a 300 MW hydrogen electrolyser plant. These moves aim to position Waaree as an integrated “full-stack energy solutions provider,” capturing up to 90 percent of the customer wallet share.

Waaree’s order book currently stands at 25 GW worth INR 49,000 crore, with a project pipeline exceeding 100 GW. In Q1, 67 percent of revenue came from the Indian market and 33 percent from exports. The company is also ramping up its U.S. operations, expanding local manufacturing from 1.6 GW to 3.2 GW, to meet demand driven by AI data centers, EV adoption, and manufacturing reshoring. The strategy ensures compliance with Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules and maintains eligibility for 45X tax credits.

The company reported profit after tax surged 93 percent year-on-year to INR 773 crore, revenue rose 31.5 percent to INR 4,597 crore, and EBITDA jumped 83 percent to INR 1,169 crore, with margins improving 700 basis points to 25.4 percent. Quarterly production hit an all-time high of 2.3 GW.

The company is promising “breakthrough electric vehicles” made in America.

A “Model T Moment” for the EV Age Ford is clearly leaning into the symbolism.","Ford is promising a revolution. The company plans to make a big announcement on August 11 about its electric vehicle future, an event it is hyping as a “Model T moment.”

In a blog post, Ford invoked the spirit of its most iconic creation, the car that “put the world on wheels” by making transportation “accessible to the masses.” The message is clear: Ford believes it is on the verge of launching a breakthrough EV that is both capable and, crucially, affordable. But what is it?

A new clue, uncovered by the site Ford Authority, suggests that Ford’s futuristic revolution will be powered by a ghost from its past. Just days before its big announcement, Ford has filed a new trademark for the name “Ranchero,” specifically for use on “Electric vehicles,” namely “pick-up trucks.”

For Ford, this is a familiar playbook. The company has mastered the art of raiding its own archives, using beloved, gas-guzzling names from its history to sell a radically new electric future. They did it with the Mustang Mach-E, weathering a storm of outrage from purists to turn it into a best-selling electric SUV. They did it again with the F-150 Lightning, attaching their most trusted truck name to their flagship EV pickup. And with the Maverick, they revived another classic name to win over a new generation of buyers.

The Ranchero trademark filing signals that Ford is about to do it again. But this time, the stakes are even higher. The company is promising “breakthrough electric vehicles” made in America. According to reports, Ford is developing a low-cost electric platform meant to underpin a range of future models, starting with a midsize pickup. That strategy could give Ford a weapon in the fight for EV affordability, a challenge even Tesla hasn’t fully solved.

The Ranchero nameplate hasn’t been seen on U.S. roads since 1979, but its history is unlike anything else in Ford’s lineup. Launched in 1957, the original Ranchero blurred the lines between car and truck, offering the comfort and style of a sedan with the practicality of a pickup bed. It quickly found a following among farmers, tradespeople, and California surfers alike.

It competed head-to-head with Chevrolet’s El Camino, part of a wave of so-called “car-truck hybrids” that traced their lineage back to Australian “utes” of the 1930s, multipurpose vehicles that could haul hay bales in the morning and churchgoers in the afternoon.

A “Model T Moment” for the EV Age

Ford is clearly leaning into the symbolism. In the blog post, the company’s heritage team invoked the birth of the Model T, the 1908 car that put the world on wheels by making personal transportation accessible to the masses. Born in secrecy on the third floor of Ford’s Piquette Plant, the Model T was designed to be universal: affordable, repairable, and adaptable for everything from climbing Pike’s Peak to serving as a snowmobile. Ford says it wants to recreate that breakthrough, this time with EVs.

“Now Ford is going back to its roots for another Model T moment,” the company wrote. “Ford leaders will share more about our plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.”

If the Ranchero is part of that vision, it could bring back the practicality and personality of the car-pickup hybrid for a new generation. This time powered by electrons, not gasoline. And if history is any guide, the electric version of the Ranchero could bridge the gap between work and play in a market where most EV pickups still aim for size and luxury, not versatility and price.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/09/A-Ford-F-150-on-a-sales-lot-in-Miami.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 15:02:56.089575

This boastful comment came from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, as he announced plans to quash a key 2009 ruling that reins in planet-warming burning of fossil fuels. Under threat now is a directive that has worked to reduce risk and protect public health in the U.S., called the “endangerment finding.”

This announcement triggered a 45-day public comment period, with a September 15 deadline. Here is where you can submit your comments.

For regular readers of this sustainability and environment column, you may recall my May 31 alert. At that time, I described draft documents leaked to the press that argued that fossil fuel burning “does not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution,” as I warned that a proposal was on the horizon. The EPA proposal is wider ranging than I anticipated, seeking to remove restraints on stationary source greenhouse gas (GHG) power plant emissions as well as non-point source polluters such as cars and trucks.

While EPA arguments seize on the ubiquity of carbon dioxide in our world and question the efficacy of the endangerment finding anyway, do not be fooled. This effort to repeal and repel the realities of 21st-century climate change may again signal nostalgic regression to yesteryear. Yet, it has been clear for many years that carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs from fossil fuel-burning activities drive human-caused climate change and endanger public health.

Back in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. was making scientific and policy progress on climate change. In 1957, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower established the President’s Scientific Advisory Committee (PSAC) to advise on policy-relevant scientific issues. It also was the International Geophysical Year that marked international scientific partnerships and cooperative efforts to study transboundary environmental problems like climate change. In 1965, a PSAC Environmental Pollution Panel was convened by U.S. President Lyndon Johnson. Their final report noted, “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air and the lead concentrations in ocean waters and human populations.” They wrote that atmospheric carbon dioxide “will modify the heat balance of the atmosphere to such an extent that marked changes in climate.”

They concluded: “The combustion of coal, oil, and gas in our homes, vehicles, and factories results in the discharge into the air of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and partially burned hydrocarbons. Some of these gases, together with gasoline and natural gas vapors, undergo chemical change in air and in sunlight, and become the noxious constituents of smog; others, like carbon dioxide, are accumulating in such large quantities that they may eventually produce marked climatic change.”

The panel recommended investments to alleviate negative impacts of local air pollutants and GHG emissions.

This time also marked the establishment of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1960. NCAR — based here in Boulder — was designed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to serve as a hub for modeling, improving and coordinating atmospheric research, including “the CO2 question.” In 1959 — in creating NCAR — NSF remarked that human “activities in consuming fossil fuels during the past hundred years … have been on a sufficient scale to make it worthwhile to examine the effects these activities have had upon the atmosphere.”

While scientists have been examining links between CO2 and climate change for over a century, in 1969, U.S. Congress held a hearing that led to the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. CAA provided guidance for the newly established EPA to set emissions limits and standards on air pollution, including GHGs. A legal test of CAA culminated in a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that the EPA did have authority and responsibility to regulate GHG emissions because GHGs were determined to be air pollutants that endangered public health and welfare. That 2007 Supreme Court decision led to the 2009 finding that’s currently under threat.

While the company explores alternative materials for its products, the energy that powers its factories and production lines proves just as crucial.

This dual focus shapes its approach to sustainability, where cleaner energy supports the shift to circular production.

Energy transition plays key role in LEGO's green mission

LEGO sets out to reduce its carbon emissions by relying more heavily on renewable energy.

The company powers all its factories using renewable sources and commits to reaching net zero by 2050.

To back this aim, it has invested in two solar parks in Texas and has signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with solar energy firm Enel North America.

The solar parks are expected to produce enough energy annually to match the electricity use of more than 100,000 homes in the US.

This helps LEGO meet its renewable energy target while supporting the grid.

By investing directly in renewable infrastructure, the company aligns energy use with its wider sustainability targets.

“This campaign is a way to celebrate the progress we’re making on our sustainability journey and to recognise the durability of the LEGO brick that fans have come to know and love,” says Annette Stube, Chief Sustainability Officer at the LEGO Group. “With half of the materials we buy to make LEGO bricks now produced with renewable sources, we’re proud of how far we've come.""

She adds: “As we continue to transition to more sustainable initiatives, we remain committed to the highest standards of safety, durability and quality, ensuring our bricks are always ready for generations of play.”

LEGO matches these actions with broader industry collaboration. The company joins RE100, a global corporate initiative focused on 100% renewable electricity. Through this group, it shares knowledge and best practices with other businesses aiming to reduce their emissions.

Supporting the next generation through sustainable action

Beyond bricks and buildings, Lego links its climate commitments to its purpose: to inspire and develop children.

The company plans to spend US$1.4bn over four years on environmental initiatives.

This includes money for renewable energy projects, sustainable materials research and upgrades to production lines.

It also sets targets to reduce emissions across all scopes – including direct emissions from factories (Scope 1), emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) and all other indirect emissions across its value chain (Scope 3).

LEGO reports that around 98% of its emissions fall into the Scope 3 category, covering everything from raw materials to product transport.

The business is transparent about the challenge of reducing those emissions, noting it will require innovation and cooperation across the supply chain.

To that end, LEGO supports suppliers to switch to renewable electricity and improve efficiency.

LEGO’s sustainability goals are now built into business decisions.

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”

“With every stroke of the pen and deletion, Trump can try to eliminate environmental and climate justice from his administration, but he won’t erase our communities,” Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said in a statement. “We are a testament that the fight will continue because everyone should have access to a clean, healthy environment and a better quality of life.”

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative released a 55-page report detailing how the Trump administration has altered the availability of environmental information in the last six months.

Information about environmental justice and climate change have disappeared from federal websites, according to the organization.

“The pace and severity of this administration’s attacks on environmental information in its first six months have been far worse than in the first Trump administration,” Izzy Pacenza, lead author of the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative study, said in a news release.

The Environmental Data and Governance Initiative’s website governance team monitored more than 4,000 federal environmental pages to find changes for the report. According to its data, the organization found 70% more website changes in Trump’s first 100 days in office in 2025 compared to during his first term in 2017.

The organization is monitoring 20% of the webpages it tracked for changes during the first Trump administration.

Information about climate change has been altered and removed, including from the U.S. Global Change Research Program website and informational resources from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website.

Climate change information remains “virtually unaltered” on the Environmental Protection Agency’s website, according to the report.

“The Trump administration’s changes to public information are part of a broader agenda to reshape the form and function of the federal government,” according to the report.

Changes relating to environmental justice and diversity, equity and inclusion have been made most frequently, according to the report. Information about environmental racism has been “entirely excised” from federal websites, according to the report.

Environmental racism is the intentional pollution and waste facilities in communities primarily made up of people of color, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. Those communities are disproportionately exposed to fumes, toxic dust, ash, soot and other pollutants, according to the NRDC. Gary was one of the communities visited by EPA officials in 2022 due to its history of heavy industry and proximity to five Superfund sites. At the time, residents were encouraged to keep tabs on environmental data.

Removing language about environmental racism denies facts and generates misinformation, as well as undermines the collective ability to address issues.

“Trustworthy information is critical for a functioning democracy,” Gretchen Gehrke, study lead author, said in a news release. “These removals reflect a broad deregulatory agenda by this administration to disavow the intersecting issues of environmental justice and climate change.”

Carolyn McCrady, member of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, responded to the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative Study’s findings, calling federal cuts relentless, ruthless and lawless, especially for communities of color.

“While (they are) depriving organizations, cities and states of the funds needed to repair environmental damage, they are also destroying the laws that provided protection since the inception of the EPA,” McCrady said in a text. “But the assault will only strengthen the resolve of people to fight to protect and preserve the very foundation of life in these targeted communities. No one is giving up.”

Earlier this year, in Indiana, Gov. Mike Braun signed two executive orders that target the environment, including one to make state regulations consistent with national ones and one prohibiting the use of the phrase “environmental justice” in permitting, enforcement and grant decisions.

“…the concept of ‘environmental justice’ has become increasingly politicized and has often led to the introduction of subjective, non-scientific factors into environmental policy and regulation…” according to one executive order.

Northwest Indiana activists previously told the Post-Tribune that Braun’s executive orders were concerning, and targeting environmental justice would be harmful for the public health and wellbeing of region communities.

In July, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a plan to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding at an Indianapolis auto dealership, which Braun and other Indiana officials supported in person. The 2009 Endangerment Finding found six greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare of current and future generations.

The American Lung Association announced in April that Hoosiers are breathing some of the nation’s most polluted air in its “State of the Air” report. The Indianapolis metro area ranked at the 54th worst in the nation for ozone pollution and 21st worst for particle pollution.

In Northwest Indiana, the American Lung Association gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. The organization also found particle pollution can cause lung cancer.

“Indiana ranks as the worst state for pollution,” Williams said. “Northwest Indiana is the epicenter of these emissions. This reality is getting worse with each rollback, each attack on those most vulnerable.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PTB-L-USSTEEL-PERMIT-0425-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-09 13:05:42.296971

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""

“This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills,” Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., stated Friday. “Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal—it’s a betrayal by this administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”

The repeal of the program, however, directly implements orders from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law a month ago. Among multiple other green energy policies, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which the Solar for All program falls under.

The program, funded by taxpayer dollars via the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, has already promised funds to 60 grant recipients across the U.S. The money was meant for the creation or expansion of solar programs meant to lower electricity bills for approximately 900,000 low-income households and increase their access to solar-produced energy.

The abrupt rescinding of the funds, though allowed for by law, will disrupt plans in 49 states. However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that “very little money” has actually been spent and that recipients are still “very much in the early planning phase, not the building and construction process.”

“But the bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin added.

Republicans targeted dozens of similar federal green energy programs and grants in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act arguing that such subsidies create a false demand for unreliable sources of electricity that have minimal positive impact on the environment.

The Solar for All program in particular wasted taxpayer dollars, Zeldin said, by diluting the billions of dollars through pass-through entities, with middlemen taking a 15% cut of total funds “by conservative estimates.”

Additionally, the program received an exemption from the Build America, Buy America law, which requires federal agencies to use American workers, products and infrastructure for projects funded by American taxpayers.

States including Ohio, Illinois, Arizona, Missouri, Virginia and Michigan had each been awarded more than $100 million from the Solar for All program and have already planned on how to disperse the promised funds.

Democratic governors were quick to condemn the EPA’s decision, with Gov.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59/20250809T121407/fbd1a651-f7ed-42cb-bedc-9a518507ed59_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 14:06:45.325815

This legislation was designed to reduce US dependence on Chinese supply chains, especially by discouraging the use of Chinese-made batteries, while also investing in cutting-edge technologies for the future, with a strong focus on clean energy.

However, with the EV tax credits set to expire on September 30th, a major player like BMW is reconsidering his strategies, finding it more cost-effective, at least in the short term, to source low-cost batteries from China once again.

BMW, and another big one like General Motors, would have preferred to use US-made batteries for their upcoming EVs if federal incentives hadn’t ended prematurely. The $7,500 consumer tax credit was crucial to offset the high costs of EVs, driven mainly by battery prices, while manufacturers worked to ramp up local production and supply chains. But then, US clean energy programs stalled.

Today, BMW (and GM) rely heavily on China’s proven battery manufacturing expertise. The Wall Street Journal reported GM will buy lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from CATL, the world’s largest battery maker, for the next-gen Chevy Bolt EV. Despite facing tariffs of roughly 80%, CATL’s scale and expertise may still offer GM a financial edge. BMW faces a similar challenge. Its battery supplier, Automotive Envision Supply Corporation (AESC), a Japanese company with plants in China, halted expansion of two facilities earlier this year due to political and market uncertainty.

In it, Rickards warns that America’s greatest national asset isn’t digital or financial—it’s physical. And it's been neglected for decades.

“We’ve had this rich endowment, as I call it, right under our feet. Yet for years, we refused to touch it.”

Why U.S. Energy Independence Was a Mirage

In the presentation, Rickards outlines how past administrations celebrated “energy independence” while importing critical materials from China and restricting access to the nation’s most resource-rich regions.

He points to large-scale deposits of copper, lithium, uranium, and rare earth elements sitting untouched across vast stretches of federal land.

“We have all these essential materials right under our feet. Incredibly… the United States is the only nation in the world that locks them up.”

The Real Bottleneck Isn’t Oil—It’s Access

Rickards says the problem isn’t finding energy or minerals—it’s bureaucracy. He calls out a decades-long pattern of permitting delays and federal restrictions that have stalled major projects for years—even decades.

“There’s a huge copper deposit in Arizona… enough to supply 25% of what we need. It’s been sitting there for 29 years.”

“The Thacker Pass Lithium Mine in Nevada is the largest known deposit of its kind… shut down since 1978.”

A Nation Sitting on a Resource Superhighway

According to Rickards, nearly one-third of the U.S. landmass is federally owned—and much of it contains strategic minerals needed for everything from national defense to electric vehicles and grid infrastructure.

“Roughly 28% of all land in the U.S. belongs to the public. And it contains world-class mineral deposits.”

He argues that tapping even a fraction of this land would give America a decisive edge in supply chains, manufacturing, and military strength—especially as tensions rise with foreign powers.

The Next Phase of American Strength Is Subsurface

Rickards believes the next evolution of U.S. leadership won’t be decided on the stock market or in Silicon Valley, but in places like Nevada, Texas, and Alaska—where deep reserves of strategic materials remain largely untouched.

“For decades… the U.S. government has blocked us from tapping into our birthright. But that’s all about to change.”

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) continues to be a focal point of debate among investors, reflecting a mix of optimism and skepticism. The company’s stock has been volatile, influenced by CEO Elon Musk’s fluctuating popularity and strategic shifts. Recently, Tesla has been focusing on expanding its capabilities beyond electric vehicles, venturing into AI and robotics. Notably, Tesla’s Q2 2025 earnings highlighted significant developments, including the rollout of robotaxi operations in Austin and record profits in its energy division. These moves are seen as potential billion-dollar opportunities, with plans to produce 1 million Optimus 3 humanoid robots in the next five years. Despite these ambitious goals, Tesla faces challenges such as tariff concerns and the loss of consumer tax credits, which have pressured its margins.

The company’s decision to disband its Dojo supercomputer team has raised concerns about its position in the AI race. However, Tesla’s recent rideshare license in Texas marks a significant step toward launching its robotaxi service, a move that has positively impacted its stock. As Tesla transitions from an automotive company to a technology powerhouse, it continues to attract both bullish and bearish views from investors. The stock currently holds a consensus Hold rating, with a 12-month average price target suggesting a slight downside. As Tesla navigates these developments, its future remains a topic of keen interest in the financial markets.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/884ea72f8a3868a03348539b3275a949-750x406.png,N,,2025-08-09 20:07:34.622750

The storage system has an energy content of 25 MWh. Other smaller projects in California followed later.

Four plants around San Antonio

Now, B2U Storage Solutions wants to scale up the business model and is planning to set up four large battery storage facilities with second-life batteries near the Texas city of San Antonio over the next twelve months. Together, these are expected to have a storage capacity of 100 MWh. B2U has already started construction of the first facility in Bexar County near San Antonio.

The company considers Texas a very suitable location, as there are already many solar parks. Once commissioned, B2U’s systems can store electricity at times of day when the state’s huge solar plants are running at full capacity and prices are low, and feed it back into the grid at times when there is little sun and peak demand. On the one hand, the battery storage systems have a stabilising effect on the grid and on the other, good money can be earned from the price differences. “Texas has been a very strong market with ever more volatility,” said CEO Freeman Hall to Canary Media. “And that’s the strength of storage: they use volatile conditions to their advantage.”

Better durability than expected

Another exciting question is how long second-life batteries from electric cars will last during daily charging and discharging. B2U’s first project in Lancaster, California, was initially designed to get 2,000 charge cycles out of the first batch of early Nissan Leaf batteries, says CEO Hall, but these batteries have now exceeded this target.

Another positive aspect is that of the 2,000 battery packs that B2U has installed in stationary storage units to date, technicians have only had to remove a single-digit number for maintenance work, says Hall. This has given the company the confidence to use the batteries a little more intensively. Thanks to real-time monitoring of the batteries, B2U is also “not as concerned about degrading the batteries,” Hall continues: “They’re turning out to be pretty strong workhorses that don’t degrade as people thought they might.”",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/08/solar-park-second-life-battery-storage-b2u-santa-barbara-california.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:52.181661

EVs can drive in the rain -- no car company would make one you can't.

You won't be stranded without a charger -- there are nearly 200k public charging stations available.

EVs are faster than gas cars -- performance wise, electricity wins.

It should come as no surprise that EV sales have risen over 10% each year since 2014, and even though they might not reach that number in 2026 due to tax credits ending in September, there are still some out there that are unsure about the validity of the platform.

I have my own opinions about how these companies are operating, but there's no denying that, as a day-to-day vehicle, EV cars are a responsible purchase. However, there are some out there who still believe some things that weren't even true back when EVs first hit the market well over a decade ago now. A myth is defined as a ""widely held but false belief or idea."" If we want to have a good dialogue around EVs, these five myths need to die a quick death sooner than later.

1 ""EVs can't drive in the rain""

Who would make a car that couldn't?

This first one stems from a pretty basic fear more than anything else -- the fear of electricity and water in the same space. I'll grant that this is warranted. After all, nobody wants to go swimming during a lightning storm for a very good reason, but in that same vein, what manufacturer would make a car that you couldn't drive in the rain? That makes no sense to me. Sure, I've welded a few rear differentials in my time, and those were sketchy in the rain at best, but most EVs are on all-wheel-drive platforms, anyway. There's quite literally no real difference between using a drill in the rain and what an EV does with its motors.

This fear is more rampant than you might think, though. In a truly shocking study, nearly 20 percent of drivers thought that they couldn't take an EV through a car wash. Come on, people -- we've got to be better than that. No car company would produce something that can't be used in the rain, full stop.

2 ""You'll be stranded without a charger""

They're more available than you might think

When EVs first hit the market, I'll relent that the infrastructure simply wasn't where it needed to be for the vast majority of people. However, this is 2025, and even though some like to think it hasn't, time always marches on. Now, there are nearly 200,000 public charging stations in the US alone, and nearly every major metropolitan area has a plethora of stations where EV owners can charge up in a hurry. Additionally, most gas stations built to support interstate travel have implemented them along most major highways, making road tripping in an SUV more doable than ever before.

These figures only represent the amount of public charging options available. There are estimated to be just as many if not more private chargers at homes and businesses across the country.

Arguably the best thing about owning an EV, though, is that you can simply opt to charge it yourself at home. Some companies offer free home charger installation with the purchase of an EV, but even if you do have to pay for one out-of-pocket, it sure beats the long-term money you'll spend on traditional gasoline going from place to place.

3 ""EVs are slower than gas cars""

This was never true, and the math backs it up

As someone who grew up going to the racetrack, and still spends quite a lot of time there, I so want this to be true. However, reality has other ideas, as EVs are far and away more impressive than their internal combustion counterparts at just about every turn. The real performance beauty comes when molding the two together, such as what's being done right now in Formula One, but when it's a straight-up head-to-head contest between electric and gas power, there really isn't any competition.

Electricity wins that match-up more times than not. It takes serious firepower to stack up to even basic levels of EV acceleration, and that's before getting into the high-performance models like the Tesla Model S, Lucid Air or the Rimac line. For instance, Carwow posted a video recently of a Kia EV6 GT, which is by no means a chart-topper in terms of performance, beating a new Lamborghini in a standing 1/4 mile drag race. Don't believe me? Then it's a good thing I've got evidence.

4 ""Cold weather kills your range""

These aren't AAA batteries we're talking about

This one is further down the list because, admittedly, freezing temperatures do hamper the EV range, but not nearly as much as some naysayers would have you think. Much like the block heaters in pickup trucks, most EV companies now release cars with heat pump technology to maximize range under even the most strenuously cold circumstances. We've talked about this issue before, and there is plenty of room to work around.

In a Recurrent study, researchers found that on models with heat pumps installed, the maximum range dropped by around just 10 percent on some of the most popular EV models on the market, like the Tesla Model X and Model S. While some lower-tier cars like the Volkswagen ID.4 did see a more significant drop-off, it wasn't tested with a heat pump. Simply put, if you live in an area of the country that regularly sees freezing temperatures in the winter months, buy an EV with a heat pump, and the problem will essentially fix itself. If you have a home charger installed alongside it, you probably wouldn't even notice a difference in the performance of your car, regardless of temperature.

5 ""You can't tow with an EV""

One look at torque figures will tell a much different story

For a while, EVs were limited to the sedan and SUV space, which led some to believe that towing with an EV was a futile venture. However, that could not be further from the truth in 2025. In fact, there are now brands on the market, like Rivian, that solely produce EV trucks and SUVs designed to fit into a more rugged lifestyle than the traditional EV buyer lives. Major automotive brands like General Motors and Ford also produce full-sized pickup trucks in EV form now with astounding torque figures.

This is a myth that simply isn't founded in logic anymore.

I'm not sure how much more proof we need that some of these myths need to go by the wayside. In 2025, it still feels like EVs are battling the same things that they did at their inception, despite making big strides towards being a more consumer-friendly option off the lot. I'm by no means the biggest proponent of EVs that there is on the planet, but if we ever want to have a real, open discussion about their validity, we need to get our facts straight, and these five myths are preventing anyone from doing just that.",https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/model-s_68.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 16:02:13.087848

An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.

It’s not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation’s biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That’s pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms” that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes - residential, commercial and industrial - are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% - or $9.3 billion - of last year’s increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a “massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new - presumably higher - power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers - at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook - or in the dark.

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn’t force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they’re paying their fair share of transmission costs “will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities - which must get their rates approved by regulators - can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.”",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/08/09/Electricity_Prices_Data_Centers_38875_c61-0-3242-1856_s1200x700.jpg?546181bf4129e33721e2a4efaaef9f0032d2145e,N,,2025-08-09 12:05:35.977266

My threshold for what constitutes ""enough"" range has increased since I took the road trip.
That's not ideal for a road trip when you go from 100% city driving to less efficient highway cruising.
Tesla Supercharger Access Wasn’t A Game Changer One of the reasons I felt confident embarking on my first EV road trip was Tesla Supercharger access.","I've owned an EV for more than a year. I scored a deal on a 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SEL AWD. I've enjoyed the car. I've put more than 5,000 all-electric miles on it. I've evangelized about how hassle-free EV ownership can be. What I had not done was the most anxiety-inducing part of EV ownership: taking a road trip. Not a really long drive. But a 600-plus-mile round-trip trek with my wife and kids in tow, requiring planning and multiple charging stops. I finally got the chance a few weekends ago, when friends invited us to their cottage in a picturesque part of Northern Michigan best left unmentioned to New Yorkers.

The experiences in this piece are those of the author and in no way mean to suggest that everyone's experiences will be similar or that infrastructure difficulties will always be this way.

My trip was neither perfect nor painless. But it wasn't a complete disaster. My family made it home with relationships intact. But my experience proved eye-opening. I'm not quite ready to bail on EVs and buy a hybrid. But I have compiled a few, hopefully helpful thoughts on the infrastructure and what I'll be looking for when I buy my next EV.

Range Is Important For EVs

This point is obvious. But it's worth reiterating: the more range your EV has, the less stressful your road trip will be. My threshold for what constitutes ""enough"" range has increased since I took the road trip. The EPA estimates that my 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 SEL will achieve 260 miles of range on a single charge. It’s probably a hair less after a year of ownership. But we can use that for the sake of the argument. Typically, I charge to 80 percent. That gives me a little over 200 miles of range to play with in optimal conditions. I don’t commute. My kids attend school within walking distance of our home. I have a Level 2 home charger. I can get to the airport and almost anywhere in Metro Detroit using less than 50 miles of range, round trip. Range is never an issue.

Road trips are atypical. I charged to 100% before leaving. However, after that first leg, I was left with about 200 miles of range to use between stops when charging to 80% – in theory. The car's functional range, presuming one doesn't wish to drain the battery completely, is less than that. For me, double-digits remaining was when the anxiety began creeping in. I started cutting my speed, rationing the air conditioning, and monitoring the delta between the range and distance remaining like a hawk. Hitting my first charging stop with the car showing 30 miles of range left was cutting it closer than I would have liked.

Not everyone can afford a Lucid Air or a Rivian Max Pack. However, even increasing the range from 250 miles to above 300 miles with a vehicle like the front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Equinox EV can reduce anxiety and, potentially, make the difference between needing a second stop or shortening your trip by half an hour to 45 minutes by avoiding it.

2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 AWD Range Versus Rivals

Range Calculators Are An Underrated Feature

My Ioniq 5 predates the 2025 refresh. The car's performance is top-notch. However, the software to manage that performance is lacking. The Ioniq 5's range calculator determines the range with a heavy weight on previous driving. That's fine during everyday usage. That's not ideal for a road trip when you go from 100% city driving to less efficient highway cruising.

When I began my drive with a 100% battery charge, my car told me I had 344 miles of range. That estimate presumed I would continue city driving in warm weather and traveling more than four miles per kWh. I knew the car would not achieve that figure. But I figured 216 miles to the first charging stop would be a safe bet. We made it with 30 miles remaining after 220 miles.

My anxiety stemmed not so much from the range but from not being able to trust what the car was telling me. The delta between my remaining range and the charging stop held steady for about the first hour or so of the drive. Then it began plummeting, particularly when the remaining range fell below 200 miles. I departed our food stop with 121 miles of range and 67 miles to the charger. That delta dipped to just 30 miles by the time I parked at the charger.

The ability to plan ahead is only as good as your data. I would have loved a feature like the integrated Google Maps in GM EVs that can map you to your destination, factor in the charging stop, and provide a relatively accurate estimate of how much battery life would be left when you arrive.

Tesla Supercharger Access Wasn’t A Game Changer

One of the reasons I felt confident embarking on my first EV road trip was Tesla Supercharger access. Hyundai sent me a free NACS adapter for my Ioniq 5. Stations are well-dispersed and maintained. Stations have numerous chargers. It felt like that network would be a reliable security blanket, making road tripping easier. It wasn't.

Adding Tesla Supercharger access didn't add places for me to stop. Other fast-charging providers in Michigan are, for the most part, not filling the gaps. Companies like Electrify America are simply placing their chargers adjacent to Tesla Superchargers. In that scenario, there's no reason to use Tesla's charging. My Ioniq 5 can charge more than twice as fast on a 350 kW charger. And paying by tapping my credit card was easier.

The one time I needed Tesla Superchargers to come through it became a near nightmare. I pulled into Bay City, MI, with about 80 miles left to travel and about 95 miles to go. It was 96 degrees. I had not noticed on the PlugShare app before leaving that all Electrify America chargers there were out of service. Tesla's eight supercharging bays were open for use. The trouble is that traffic was heavy. Most EVs on the road are Teslas. And all the bays were full.

Ford's Blue Oval Network Was My Salvation

I waited in line for a few minutes before a bay opened up. I pulled in. The problem was that Tesla's cord was too short. It only reaches Tesla ports on the left rear of the vehicle. The Ioniq 5 has its charger on the right side. My options were to wait by the one bay I could angle my car into or wait for two consecutive spaces to open up and claim them both. I did find salvation, but it came at a Blue Oval Network charger at a Ford dealer a mile away.

Better Infrastructure Around The EV Charger Could Make A Huge Difference

Charging time is important. But it’s only part of the time you spend off the highway. The distance to the charger and poor infrastructure around it can increase the stop time. Most EV fast chargers in Michigan reside at large big-box retailers like Meijer (or ""Meijer’s"" if you’re a Michigander). That’s good in a sense: Meijer stores are already strategically located at hubs. But they are typically off the main drag, around a mile or two from the highway. Driving to and fro can add three to five minutes to the stop length on both ends.

Having the charger at Meijer is great for bathroom access and potential grocery shopping. But they are typically located away from the restaurants and fast food outlets just off the highway. So, you can’t just get lunch in the dead time while charging. A typical stop could look like this: drive a half-mile east, wait in a drive-thru line for 10-15 minutes, then drive 2.5 miles back across the highway in the opposite direction (five or so minutes) to reach the charger. Spend 15-20 minutes charging. Spend another 3-5 minutes driving back to the highway.

Real time spent can be upwards of 40 minutes. Food near the chargers or chargers at food outlets could significantly reduce that time. And the time savings may even be worth having to scarf down $13 Elon dogs.

When EV Infrastructure Worked, It Was Great

But for the aforementioned snafu in Bay City, my charging experiences were pleasant. My Ioniq 5 charged like a beast on Electrify America chargers, reaching a peak of 220 kW. Going from 13% to 80% took a little over 20 minutes.

I also found a bank of 160 kW fast chargers at City Hall in Cheboygan, MI. None of them were in use on a Saturday night. I left the car on the charger while we got the kids ice cream and stopped for an outdoor beer. It was 100 percent full when I returned an hour or so later. It also allows me to tap my card to pay, rather than using an app. The extra charging allowed us to take a detour to a lighthouse on the way home.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ioniq-5-road-trip-lead.JPG,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:32.197064

""The great concern is about natural gas,"" said Bodman.
Several Louisiana-based natural gas processors still are not functioning, ""and the status of many of them is uncertain,'' Bodman said.
""It's also important to note that natural gas utilities purchase natural gas in the spring and summer that they store for later use during the colder months.
Meanwhile, another energy company on Tuesday revised its third quarter and full-year oil and natural gas production figures because of Katrina.","Two senior Bush administration officials warned Tuesday of possible natural gas shortages because of the slow recovery following Hurricane Katrina, and their statements were mirrored in the Minerals Management Service report, which showed shut-in gas volumes had barely inched down in 24 hours to 3.720 Bcf/d, or 37.20% of daily gas production offshore, compared with Monday's shut-in report of 3.784 Bcf/d. Leaping into the breach, the American Gas Association (AGA) quickly announced that it expected no supply disruptions this winter.

The cumulative shut-in gas production since Aug. 26 is 95.476 Bcf, equivalent to 2.616% of the yearly production of 3.65 Tcf of gas in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM).

Shut-in oil production as of midday Tuesday was 846,720 bbl/d, equivalent to 56.45% of the normal daily oil production in the GOM, which was 1.5 million bbl/d. The cumulative shut-in oil production since Aug. 26 is 19.690 million bbl, equivalent to 3.596 % of the yearly 547.5 million bbl of oil production offshore.

As of Tuesday, 10.62% of 819 manned platforms and 1.49% of 134 rigs currently operating in the Gulf remained evacuated.

Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman and Interior Secretary Gail Norton, touring the Gulf Coast region on Tuesday, told reporters that gas shortages are possible because of the slow recovery to damaged production and related facilities both on and offshore. The two flew to Baton Rouge, LA from Houston after meeting with several senior energy executives Monday night to discuss their recovery efforts following the hurricane.

""The great concern is about natural gas,"" said Bodman. Less is known about the damage to the gas supply system than the effect on crude oil production because of possible offshore pipeline damage still not discovered and flooded gas processing facilities onshore.

Several Louisiana-based natural gas processors still are not functioning, ""and the status of many of them is uncertain,'' Bodman said. With the United States headed into the winter heating season, gas inventories are at ""lower levels than we would like."" The U.S. has no emergency gas reserve similar to the strategic oil reserve, he noted.

About 90% of the Gulf oil platforms are expected to be capable of production by the end of September, said Norton. However, damage to onshore facilities may reduce oil output offshore, and in turn slow processing onshore, which may have to be rerouted.

Norton said, ""There is more concern about gas because we don't have an international market"" to use for additional gas supplies.

Offshore gas production's return to normal ""depends on things like Highway 23,"" she said. Highway 23 runs south from New Orleans along a narrow peninsula highway running parallel to several refineries, gas processors and pipelines, which is where Katrina came onshore.

Among the gas facilities located along Highway 23 is Dynegy Inc.'s Venice, LA plant in Plaquemines Parish, which was flooded, and has a capacity of 1.3 Bcf/d. Another Dynegy gas processing plant, the Yscloskey facility in flooded St. Bernard Parish along the highway, can process 1.85 Bcf/d. Another damaged gas processor, Enterprise Products Partners LP's plant in Toca, may be returned to service in a few weeks, said spokesman Randy Burkhalter. The plant has a 1.1 Bcf/d processing capacity.

The highway and the region remain under water in several places, and the area also is blocked by many obstacles, including wrecked boats, Norton said. She based her comments on aerial photographs taken of the damaged region.

The comments of the two administration leaders drew no reaction from the natural gas futures market, which already had factored in an extended downtime, but it did get a rise out of the AGA, which represents 195 utility companies who would rather not have the general public push the panic button.

In response to Norton's and Bodman's comments the AGA late Tuesday said, ""Katrina has created disruptions in the flow of natural gas from the eastern region of the Gulf of Mexico, further tightening the natural gas market and pushing both current and projected prices sharply higher. However, natural gas utilities have a supply portfolio that extends well beyond the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas utilities rely on natural gas from a variety of sources to provide service to their customers, including the western Gulf of Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, the mountain West, Appalachia and Canada. In addition, a small but growing amount of natural gas is imported from overseas in liquefied form. It is estimated that gas supply volumes today are roughly 94% of the pre-Katrina levels.

""It's also important to note that natural gas utilities purchase natural gas in the spring and summer that they store for later use during the colder months. According to the latest statistics from the federal Energy Information Agency, natural gas storage currently is ahead of the five-year average for this time of year. Assuming that the production, processing and delivery system for natural gas continues to improve, or at least does not deteriorate, AGA anticipates no unusual supply disruptions this winter.""

Meanwhile, another energy company on Tuesday revised its third quarter and full-year oil and natural gas production figures because of Katrina. PetroQuest Energy Inc. dropped its third quarter production guidance to 46-49 MMcfe/d from a previously issued guidance of 49-53 MMcfe/d, ""primarily due to production downtime during Hurricane Katrina, production that remains shut in as a result of the hurricane and a deferral of initial production at the company's Pebble Beach prospect due to the hurricane.""

PetroQuest production that remains shut-in is approximately 2.3 Mcfe/d, and ""is contingent on third-party pipelines and processing facilities."" PetroQuest still expects initial production from its Pebble Beach prospect in October. After full inspections were completed, the company found no reservoir damage and only minor superficial damage sustained to surface facilities.

Additionally, PetroQuest revised full-year 2005 production guidance to 47-50 MMcfe/d, down from previous guidance of 50-55 MMcfe/d because of hurricane-related issues, as well as a deferral of production from the company's Main Pass facilities. Main Pass production is contingent on third-party pipelines and processing facilities being put back into service. The company expects to complete its lateral line connection in October and production to resume at Main Pass in November.

Originally seen as a simple and affordable mobility option, LSEVs are now evolving into smart, connected vehicles playing a critical role in last-mile connectivity, green logistics, and even urban planning.

These vehicles are lightweight, inexpensive, and exempt from license and registration requirements. That makes them especially appealing to students, senior citizens, gig workers, and cost-conscious commuters. But what’s more significant is how these so-called “slow” scooters are driving a much faster transformation in the way India moves, plans, and powers its cities.

Accessible, Affordable, and Smart by Design

LSEVs offer one of the easiest entry points into the electric mobility space. With lower price tags compared to high-speed EVs and virtually no paperwork required in many states, they democratize access to clean transport. Riders save not just on upfront costs, but also operational ones with running costs estimated at just ₹0.20/km, a fraction of traditional petrol scooters.

These LSEVs can go up to 50- 100 kms on a single charge. Despite their simplicity, today’s LSEVs come with features once found only in premium vehicles. Many models include smart dashboards, regenerative braking, GPS tracking, and app-based controls for battery monitoring and geofencing (the use of GPS technology to create a virtual geographic boundary) helps a fleet trigger a response when a vehicle enters or leaves a defined area. That makes them not only economical, but intelligent.

Making Fleets Smarter and Greener

What truly sets connected LSEVs apart is their utility in fleet operations. With built-in IoT systems and real-time GPS connectivity, operators can monitor vehicle usage, manage cost, schedule maintenance, and optimize delivery routes.

This enables more efficient logistics, especially for last-mile connectivity. Also, shared mobility companies and delivery services are deploying thousands of such connected scooters across urban centers. The result is lower fuel costs, better route planning, and measurable sustainability outcomes

Charging Infrastructure Is Catching Up

One of the early limitations for EVs i.e. access to charging is rapidly being addressed. In Delhi, policies now mandate a charging or battery-swapping station every 5 km. Across India, new Swapping as well as charging infrastructure is being installed in residential areas, malls, metro stations, and parking lots. What’s more, battery-as-a-service (BaaS) models allow users to swap batteries in under Two minutes, an ideal solution for fleet operators or gig workers who can’t afford high upfront cost as well as long charging downtimes. This convenience is critical for scaling adoption.

Everyday Mobility Meets Urban Sustainability

From the everyday urban user perspective, LSEVs are a functional option for everything from daily tasks, commuting to work, dropping kids off at school, or just a quick jaunt around the neighborhood. Their size allows for quick parking and maneuverability, and their quiet and non-polluting operation is often more suitable to urban and high-density living.

For commercial delivery fleets, LSEVs are quickly becoming the vehicle of choice with operating ranges consistently above 100 Km per charge and low maintenance costs. With fuel prices increasing and urban congestion continuing, the case for electrification has never been better.

Building Smarter Cities, One Scooter at a Time

Beyond their everyday utility, connected LSEVs are playing a subtle but powerful role in the evolution of smart cities. These scooters generate anonymized data on movement patterns, traffic bottlenecks, and energy use insights that urban planners can use to improve transport infrastructure, reduce congestion, and plan EV-ready zones.

Their environmental benefits are also cumulative. The more such vehicles hit the road, the lower the emissions, noise pollution, and traffic burden in our cities. They are helping to shift India’s mobility model from reactive to responsive from just commuting to communicating.

The Road Ahead

India’s electric mobility future isn’t being built only by high-speed vehicles or premium cars. It’s being shaped day by day by low-speed, smart scooters that quietly do the heavy lifting of daily transport, delivery, and data collection. With battery technology improving, infrastructure expanding, and policies aligning, connected LSEVs are no longer the side story. They are the first step in building a new kind of city one that’s cleaner, quieter, and more connected.

A lot of people want to get a hold of James Talarico these days. The 36-year-old Texas state representative and seminary student is a rising Democratic star. You—like 5.6 million others—may have seen him in your social-media feed, calling a proposal to place the Ten Commandments in every public-school classroom “un-Christian” and the mark of a “dead religion.” Or perhaps you caught his recent two-and-a-half-hour conversation with Joe Rogan—who told him he should run for president. (He’s thinking about running for Senate.)

He’s also on the lam. The state speaker of the house ordered arrest warrants for Talarico and dozens of Democrats who left the state last weekend to prevent a vote on a mid-decade redistricting plan that would likely give Republicans five more congressional seats. “Right before we got on the flight to leave Texas, we all gathered in an interfaith prayer, holding each other’s hands, because this is not just a political struggle, it’s also a spiritual struggle,” Talarico says. I spoke to the legislator via Zoom from an undisclosed location outside Chicago on Thursday, hours after Republican Sen. John Cornyn—a man he may end up running against next fall—announced that the Trump administration would assign FBI agents to help “hold these supposed lawmakers accountable.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Tim Murphy: Sen. John Cornyn says the FBI has agreed to help locate you. How does it feel to officially be wanted by the FBI?

James Talarico: Well, I mean, I think Senator Cornyn is trying to stay relevant in his primary battle with Ken Paxton. So I understand the gimmick, but I think it should trouble us that any politician is trying to use the resources of the state to arrest or remove duly elected legislators who are exercising their constitutional right to break quorum. The Texas State Constitution gives us this tool in our toolbox as the minority to check the abuses of the majority, and so we’re not doing anything wrong. And there’s about 200 years of history in this country of legislators breaking quorum, including Abraham Lincoln. You know, we’re here in Illinois, in the Land of Lincoln. And that’s appropriate because, because Abraham Lincoln broke quorum in 1840 as a state senator by jumping out of the window of the Illinois State Capitol. And thankfully, I didn’t have to jump out of any windows back in Texas. But this is not unusual. It is a tool the minority has. And so for Greg Abbott to threaten to remove us from office, for Ken Paxton and John Cornyn to be threatening our arrest, it is unacceptable in a democracy, and this is a page out of an authoritarian playbook we’ve seen in other countries, and it should be alarming to all of us, regardless of our political party.

TM: So what’s at stake here? Why are you here—wherever you are?

JT: Trump is asking Texas Republicans to redraw the maps that they just drew in 2021 to get him five more seats to protect his majority in Congress, because he’s worried about losing it in the next election, and it’s because his policies are unpopular, right? He’s starting wars and wrecking the economy. He’s protecting pedophiles. He’s kicking millions of people off their health care to fund tax breaks for billionaires, and those policies deserve to be evaluated by the American people and the only way we can hold the most powerful politician our country accountable is through free and fair elections, especially in the midterms, and that’s what’s at stake here. And it’s not just a Texas problem. It’s an American problem.

TM: What persuaded you to actually leave? Because it seems like there was a bit of debate among Democrats, and not all of your colleagues actually have left the state.

JT: When Donald Trump asked Georgia Republicans to find him 11,000 more votes after he lost the 2020 election, they said, No, sir. But when Trump asked Texas Republicans to find him five more congressional seats ahead of the 2026 elections, they said, How about Thursday? So the responsibility to defend and fix this representative democracy of ours fell to Texas Democrats, and 57 of us answered the call, and we’re proud to do so, regardless of what consequences we may face.

TM: Can you tell me a little bit about where you are, as much as you’re able to say?

JT: Well, we’re here in Illinois, and in a nondescript hotel room, as you can see, and that’s for security reasons. As you may have read, we had a bomb threat called into our hotel, and Ken Paxton has put out a tweet asking his followers to “hunt us down.” And so, you know, we’re trying to keep all of our members safe, all of our staff members safe, as we do this important work of fixing this democracy of ours so that it can work for every Texan and every American.

TM: What was that bomb threat like?

JT: It was early in the morning. I woke up to the bomb threat, and a lot of my colleagues did. And it was certainly scary, because we all had to evacuate, and law enforcement swarmed the premises, and we were outside for hours. But I think it’s a reminder that what we’re doing is very important. They wouldn’t be trying to bomb you if you’re not doing something consequential. And we feel that we are at the front lines of protecting and hopefully advancing the American experiment, because if people—Democrats, independents and Republicans alike—can’t hold their elected officials accountable in a midterm election, if they’re not able to change their government from the bottom up, if they’re not able to elect the representatives of their choice, then we no longer have representative democracy and and we’re not ready to accept that.

TM: Texas legislators make something like $7,200 a year. You’re not swimming in inherited wealth or anything like that. Are you putting everything on your card while you’re up here or is somebody else paying for the hotel room? How does this work financially?

JT: It depends. You know, we’re facing financial penalties, fines from the state legislature for breaking quorum. It’s about $500 a day. Those we’re going to pay ourselves, which certainly won’t be easy to do depending how long this lasts, but we will be paying those fines ourselves. Travel, food, lodging—that we’re able to pay out of our campaign accounts, out of the caucus’ account. And thankfully, you know, we have been flooded with grassroots donations from all across Texas, from all across America. You know, $5, $10, $15—regular people funding this operation of ours. And it’s appropriate because we’re fighting for the people, not just Democrats, but independents and Republicans too, and it’s appropriate that those people are the ones funding this effort.

TM: What did you expect from this episode, versus what you’ve gotten? Because it seems a bit more intense than what you went through in 2021.

JT: I think that’s right. I’ve been frankly shocked at how Texas Republicans have conducted themselves, you know, endangering the safety of their colleagues, threatening to remove those colleagues from their duly elected positions and then, you know, people like Donald Trump sending in the FBI to find us. So that kind of rhetoric, those kind of actions, should be deeply disturbing to every American, regardless of their political affiliation, because we’ve seen how this authoritarian playbook works out in other countries, and it doesn’t lead anywhere good.

TM: There’s been a lot of legal threats swirling around this, from Ken Paxton, John Cornyn, Donald Trump, Greg Abbott. How much of this is kind of jockeying for the primary, as you mentioned, and how much of this is like real legal threats that you’re concerned about?

JT: It’s hard to tell. And you know, we think they’re on pretty dubious legal ground but unfortunately, our courts have become highly politicized. They’ve been bought by big money, particularly in Texas, and so it may not matter what the law says. It may just matter what the politics requires, and so we’ll see how this plays out. But my colleagues and I are not going to be deterred. We are here to fight for our constituents and fight for all Texans. We’re here to fight for free and fair elections for every single person in this country and we’re participating in a long American tradition of standing up to bullies, of speaking truth to power, of civil disobedience, of good trouble.

TM: There’s a push to have Democrats respond in kind with redistricting elsewhere. It’s something that Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has called for. Do you think that that’s something that Democrats can actually level the playing field with or is that a losing battle against a party that controls a lot more states?

JT: Our ultimate goal is to get the politics out of redistricting everywhere. We should ban gerrymandering across this country, in every state, red states and blue states alike. It’s why I filed a bill in the Texas legislature to create an independent, citizen led redistricting commission so that voters can choose their politicians instead of politicians choosing their voters. That said, if one side is intent on cheating—which is exactly what Texas Republicans are doing and what Donald Trump is doing by redrawing the maps in the middle of the decade at the direct request of the most powerful man in the country—they are attempting to rig the next election. There’s no other way to describe it. And so if that’s the case, if one side’s going to cheat, all bets are off. And Democrats should not unilaterally disarm, but we should maintain our vision for how we can ultimately fix this democracy so it can work for regular people all over the country.

TM: Do you really think that you can stop this particular redistricting effort from advancing, if you come back and Greg Abbott just calls another session and another session after that?

JT: If every American who took a brave stand throughout our history did it because they knew they were going to win, we’d probably have a very different country right now. Sometimes you have to stand up, even if you’re not sure if you’ll be successful. But I can just tell you, over the last four days of this special session and of this quorum break, we have shined a national, an international spotlight on this power grab in Texas, and that, in and of itself, is a victory. People and the media are talking about this in a way they weren’t before. Sometimes the media needs conflict to be able to report on the news, and so we’re happy to provide that to make sure that all Americans are informed about what’s happening in their name and what’s happening in their government, and how the most powerful politician in the country is trying to rig the upcoming midterm elections. But if we can inspire blue states to respond in kind, if we can inspire acts of courage across the country to stand up to these would be tyrants, then we’re going to consider that a victory.

TM: What would you like to be working on in a special session if you were back in Austin, not not dealing with redistricting?

JT: I think the top of the list is relief for those flood victims and their families in the Texas Hill Country, an area of the state that means a lot to me personally, where I’ve spent a lot of time, where my family has lived, and so we need to get that relief to that community, and we’ve got to prevent a disaster like that from happening ever again in our state. We showed up two weeks ago at the beginning of this special session, and we begged our Republican colleagues to prioritize flood relief and disaster mitigation, and they refused to do so. They held 12 hearings on redistricting, and they held two hearings on flood relief. They didn’t even file a flood bill, and so instead, they put flood victims and their families at the end of the agenda and used them as leverage to try to rig the next election and pass these correct maps. It’s cynical politics at its worst. It’s deeply immoral, and it should outrage all of us, regardless of our party.

TM: You’ve been floated as a candidate for US Senator and governor. Have you narrowed that search at all, or the timeline for that?",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250808-james-talarico2000px.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:56.671978

Climate-driven disruptions—from wildfires to hurricanes—are no longer distant threats but recurring realities reshaping financial markets. For utility stocks, which form the backbone of energy and water infrastructure, the stakes are particularly high. While the sector has shown resilience in 2025, with the Morningstar US Utilities Index up 12% year-to-date, underlying vulnerabilities are growing. Meanwhile, a new wave of infrastructure innovators is emerging, leveraging technology and policy to build systems that not only withstand climate shocks but thrive in them. For investors, this duality presents a critical choice: mitigate risk by avoiding climate-vulnerable utilities or capitalize on the opportunities in resilience-driven innovation.

The Growing Financial Risk of Climate Vulnerability

Utility stocks, long prized for their defensive characteristics, are now facing a perfect storm of climate and regulatory pressures. Natural disasters are exacting a heavy toll. For instance, CenterPoint Energy's $1.8 billion in restoration costs from Hurricane Beryl in 2024 underscores the operational and financial fragility of climate-exposed utilities. Similarly, Southern California's 2025 wildfires, projected to be the most expensive in history, highlight the sector's exposure to regional climate risks. Utilities in high-risk areas—such as Florida and the Southwest—are particularly vulnerable, with restoration costs often exceeding revenue streams and requiring regulatory approval to pass expenses to customers.

Regulatory shifts further complicate the landscape. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act's accelerated timeline for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy tax credits has forced utilities to rush projects online by 2027. While this drives short-term growth in renewables, it also creates bottlenecks in supply chains and regulatory approvals, delaying critical infrastructure upgrades. Meanwhile, interest rates remain a headwind. At 4.7%, the 10-year Treasury yield now outpaces utility dividend yields (3.3%), the largest discount since 2008. This inversion signals a loss of appeal for income-focused investors, compounding pressure on utilities to innovate or risk obsolescence.

The financial risks are not abstract. Avista Corp.'s Q2 2025 earnings decline of 41%—driven by devalued clean technology investments—illustrates the volatility of utilities struggling to balance climate adaptation with profitability. Even as core operations show resilience, the sector's long-term viability hinges on its ability to future-proof infrastructure against a rapidly changing climate.

The Investment Opportunity in Resilience-Driven Infrastructure Innovators

Amid these challenges, a new class of infrastructure innovators is redefining the rules of the game. These companies are not merely mitigating climate risks; they are transforming them into competitive advantages. Consider BETA Technologies, a leader in battery-powered aircraft. With a backlog of 600 orders from clients like Air New Zealand and the U.S. Air Force, BETA's zero-emission solutions are gaining traction in both commercial and defense sectors. Its financial performance—driven by contracts with high-profile partners—demonstrates the scalability of climate-resilient technologies.

In the energy space, Fervo Energy is pioneering geothermal power, with a project slated to deliver 400 megawatts of carbon-free electricity by 2028. Backed by the U.S. Air Force and private investors, Fervo's approach combines advanced drilling techniques with AI-driven resource mapping, reducing costs and accelerating deployment. Similarly, Heirloom, a carbon removal startup, has shipped the first carbon credits under the Frontier fund, attracting investments from Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy and Stripe. Its direct air capture technology offers a scalable solution for corporate net-zero commitments, aligning with regulatory pressures and investor demand for measurable impact.

These innovators share a common trait: they address climate vulnerabilities through technological and operational agility. For example, HA Sustainable Infrastructure Capital (HASI) has grown managed assets to $14.6 billion by focusing on high-yield, ESG-aligned projects, including solar and storage. Its 25% year-over-year increase in Adjusted Recurring Net Investment Income (ARNII) to $85 million underscores the financial viability of resilience-driven strategies.

Strategic Implications for Investors

The contrast between climate-vulnerable utilities and resilience-driven innovators is stark. While the former face declining margins and regulatory uncertainty, the latter are capturing market share by solving the very problems that threaten traditional infrastructure. For investors, this divergence demands a recalibration of risk-return profiles.

Diversify Exposure to Resilience-Driven Sectors: Allocate capital to companies that integrate climate resilience into their core operations. This includes geothermal energy (e.g., Fervo), carbon removal (e.g., Heirloom), and advanced grid technologies. These firms are positioned to benefit from both regulatory tailwinds and growing demand for sustainable infrastructure.

Prioritize ESG Alignment: Utilities with strong environmental, social, and governance (ESG) credentials—like HASI—are better equipped to navigate climate risks. ESG metrics are increasingly predictive of long-term financial performance, particularly in sectors exposed to regulatory and physical climate shocks.

Monitor Policy and Interest Rate Dynamics: The IRA's tax credits and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's deadlines will shape the energy transition. Investors should track how utilities and innovators adapt to these timelines, as well as how interest rate trends affect borrowing costs for infrastructure projects.

Conclusion: Building a Climate-Resilient Portfolio

The 2025 landscape is defined by a tension between risk and opportunity. Climate-vulnerable utilities, despite their defensive appeal, are increasingly exposed to volatility from natural disasters, regulatory shifts, and interest rate pressures. In contrast, resilience-driven innovators are leveraging technology and policy to create infrastructure that is not only climate-proof but economically robust.

For investors, the path forward is clear: shift capital toward companies that are redefining resilience in the face of climate-driven disruptions. By doing so, they can mitigate risk while capturing the upside of a sector poised for transformation. In an era of uncertainty, the most successful portfolios will be those that anticipate the future rather than react to it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 02:08:16.382729

Editor’s Note: The above guest column was penned by Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association and former Texas Agriculture Commissioner.","New data from S&P Global reveals the Permian Basin’s dramatic emissions progress, as Texas continues to deliver energy security for America and our allies

World-leading production and unmatched environmental progress define the Permian Basin. In one of the most prolific oil and natural gas basins in the world, Permian Basin operators have slashed methane emission intensity by more than half in just two years, reinforcing Texas as the global standard bearer in energy leadership. This groundbreaking achievement, detailed in a new report from S&P Global Commodity Insights, is far more than a statistical blip; it’s a testament to the hard work, proactive efforts, and constant innovation of Texas oil and natural gas operators.

This dramatic reduction in methane intensity is a direct result of our industry’s focus on deploying cutting-edge technologies, implementing best operating practices, and making substantial investments in infrastructure and innovation. From advanced leak detection and repair programs to strategic use of artificial intelligence and the modernization of equipment, our industry is leading the charge in minimizing emissions.

In fact, this remarkable progress has occurred even as volumes in the Permian Basin have continued to increase, demonstrating that environmental progress and robust production can and do go hand in hand. And the stakes have never been higher. Energy security is national security, and by producing energy cleanly and efficiently, our state is strengthening its position as a reliable energy provider both to our nation and our allies around the globe.

Industry-led partnerships like the Texas Methane & Flaring Coalition and the Environmental Partnership have been in essential in bringing scores of operators together in a collaborative manner with the shared goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030 through identifying and advocating for best practices. By working together, we will continue to champion policies that foster innovation and allow our industry to lead by example.

Despite efforts by opponents to dismantle the Texas oil and natural gas industry, our industry is responding with an unwavering commitment to environmental stewardship—proving that no one produces, transports, refines, or exports energy to higher standards. This is the same industry that contributes $27 billion annually in state and local taxes and royalties, directly funding our schools, universities, road infrastructure, and countless other essential services, while supporting billions in payroll and millions of jobs.

The Texas oil and natural gas industry is busy benefiting every Texan, every day, whether you live in the oil patch or not. This new data is a powerful affirmation of our progress, and a clear signal that the Lone Star State is, and will remain, at the forefront of energy leadership for generations to come.

Counting the procession of acting IRS heads that followed Werfel’s departure (Werfel was forced out by President Donald Trump when Long was nominated), Long was the sixth person to run the IRS since the beginning of the year. He will be replaced by Scott Bessent, who will serve as Acting Commissioner at the same time he serves as the Secretary of the Treasury.

It’s not just those at the top who are exiting the agency. As I reported earlier, the IRS workforce dropped from 103,000 employees in January 2025 to approximately 77,000 in May 2025 (a 25% reduction).

The departures of leadership and the general workforce come just as the IRS is gearing up for next year's tax season–the start date has not been determined. Long raised eyebrows last month when he suggested that the filing season should start around Presidents Day (February 16). The IRS quickly walked that back, noting, “The IRS looks forward to another successful tax filing season next year, and we will announce the timing of its opening in the regular course.""

The IRS has also announced that, despite new tax breaks for tipped and overtime income that take effect, retroactively for all of 2025, there will be no changes to withholding tables for 2025 or changes to certain information returns, including Form W-2, Forms 1099, Form 941 and other payroll return forms for 2025. Employers and payroll providers should continue using current procedures for reporting and withholding.

According to the IRS, these moves are ""intended to avoid disruptions during the tax filing season and to give the IRS, business and tax professionals enough time to implement the changes effectively.” But not all tax professionals agree. Among other questions raised by the move, with no changes to Form W-2, it’s now unclear how that income will be reported for purposes of claiming the deduction for overtime (overtime is currently not separately stated on Form W-2).

Another issue related to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that’s making news: recent headlines suggesting that certain tax issues could lead to the loss of U.S. citizenship. This fear is now being amplified on various platforms and stems from a case involving Vanessa Ben, a Houston woman facing denaturalization over her admission of tax fraud prior to naturalizing. Taxpayers should be cautious of overly alarmist narratives or unscrupulous tax professionals who may be seeking to profit from the overwhelming sense of panic. False tax returns, for example, may constitute tax fraud if the return was filed with intent to evade taxes. Distinguishing between honest errors and willful misconduct is key.

Tax evasion was also in the news this week following a guilty plea from Timothy McPhee, a Colorado man who promoted the use of an illegal tax shelter. A tax shelter is a financial strategy used to reduce taxable income. Not all tax shelters are illegal—Iegal tax shelters include tax-favored accounts like retirement account. But illegal tax shelters—those created to generate unintended tax “benefits”—are created for the purpose of evading tax.

McPhee promoted an abusive tax shelter made up of a private family foundation and three trusts: a business trust, a family trust, and a charitable trust. The trusts were successively layered, meaning that each trust named the next trust in the series as its beneficiary. McPhee taught clients who purchased the tax shelter how to use the trusts and foundation to evade paying federal income taxes on nearly all their income.

More than two hundred taxpayers nationwide purchased the abusive tax shelter. These clients collectively sheltered approximately $159 million in income, which resulted in the underpayment of about $45 million in federal income taxes.

While willful behaviors can land you in big tax trouble, you can also fall into tax trouble. As meme stocks have made something of a comeback this summer, investors risk running afoul of the too-often neglected “wash sale” rule.

Here’s how that can happen. When you’re buying and selling stocks quickly, you may trade winners and losers within days of each other. But when you sell a stock or other security at a loss and then buy the same security—or a similar one—within 30 days before or after the sale, it’s considered a wash sale. The loss is then disallowed, meaning you can't use it to offset any capital gains. That can result in an ugly tax bill.

Buying and selling within a short time frame may be done deliberately as part of a strategy that some taxpayers use to reduce their tax bill. Sometimes referred to as tax-loss harvesting, the goal is to sell stocks that are losing money and use the loss to offset the money-makers. That still works, so long as you don’t run afoul of the wash sale rules.

Importantly, the transaction doesn’t have to be intentional to trigger the wash sale rule. Dividend reinvestment and employee stock plan acquisitions may create a wash sale, as could buying and selling quickly. It’s important to keep good records and double-check at tax time to see whether your transactions might count as wash sales. Or better yet, avoid wash sales when you trade. The rules involving wash sales and a lot of other tax rules too, are complex, so even when you’re aware of them, it’s easy to fall into a tax trap. A financial or tax advisor may be able to help you avoid the pitfalls—and a hefty tax bill.

Speaking of double-checking, eagle-eye readers may have noticed that last week’s email edition of the newsletter had some duplicated paragraphs. When I put together the newsletter each week, it gets edited and then moved over into two different applications–one for the email newsletter and one for the online version.

Questions

This week, a reader asks:

There are a lot of dates in the One Big Beautiful Act. With school starting soon, can you tell me when the new 529 provisions kick in? Is it next year?

A section 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for education expenses. As written, earnings in 529 plans grow tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified education expenses are also tax-free.

The new tax law allows up to $10,000 in tax-free distributions this year from section 529 plans to be used for additional educational expenses in connection with enrollment or attendance at an elementary or secondary school, including private schools and religious schools. Those expenses include tuition, curricular materials, books and other instructional materials, online materials, and tuition for tutoring. Expenses may also include educational therapies for students with disabilities provided by a licensed or accredited practitioner or provider, including occupational, behavioral, physical, and speech-language therapies.

Finally, it also includes test fees for achievement tests, Advanced Placement (AP) exams, and college admissions exams (such as the SAT) and fees for dual enrollment in an institution of higher education (college courses that count for both high school and college credit).

The law also allows tax-free distributions to be used for additional qualified higher education expenses, including “qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses”—this is similar to the criteria for the Lifetime Learning Credit.

Account owners can begin using 529 funds for the new expenses as of July 5, 2025. So, if you have expenses to pay, you can make your withdrawals now. A little extra good news? Beginning January 1, 2026, the expense limit will rise to $20,000 per year.

Statistics, Charts, and Graphs

How did the IRS spend $79.5 billion in supplemental funding allocated by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA)? Here’s a hint: It didn’t.

While Congress IRS initially earmarked $79.4 billion in supplemental funding to be spent over ten years as part of the IRA, that didn’t last long. Congress subsequently clawed back more than half of that funding, leaving the agency just $37.6 billion, which is expected to last through September 30, 2031. Of the $41.8 billion rescinded by Congress, all of it was taken from money previously earmarked for enforcement.

As of March 31, 2025, the IRS has spent approximately $13.8 billion of that money.

The remaining funding has been earmarked to help improve taxpayer services, modernize technology, and increase compliance and enforcement actions. As you can see from the charts, which shows the split between funds that have been spent versus what remains, by percentages, funding skewed towards enforcement and taxpayer services.

As of March 31, 2025, the IRS has spent money on the following activities:

Operations Support - $6 billion of $25.3 billion

Business Systems Modernization - $2.7 billion of $4.8 billion

Enforcement - $2.7 billion of $3.8 billion

Taxpayer Services - $2.2 billion of $3.2 billion

Energy Security - $63.6 million of $500 million

The IRA funding was intended to supplement, not replace, the agency’s annual appropriation. Notably, the IRS has received the same annual appropriation each year since the IRA took effect, with no adjustments for inflation. As a result, approximately $2 billion in IRA funds has been used to supplement the IRS annual appropriations, since, according to the IRS, appropriations did not cover normal operating expenses.

A Deeper Dive

Would former President Ronald Reagan have embraced President Trump’s tariffs?

Tax historian Joseph Thorndike says no, writing, “Ronald Reagan was no fan of tariffs. In fact, he was an ardent (if inconstant) champion of free trade and open markets.”

Thorndike suggests that efforts to persuade taxpayers that the opposite is true is historical revisionism. In particular, he notes, it brushes aside Reagan’s many public statements extolling the virtues of free trade — and denouncing the politics of protection.

“A creative, competitive America is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs,” Reagan declared in one typical statement. “We should always remember: Protectionism is destructionism.”

As Reagan began his presidency in 1981, the United States was facing a range of challenging economic pressures; rising unemployment and high interest rates were making things hard for many Americans. Some of these problems were linked — both in reality and in the public mind — to international trade, and the new president faced immediate pressure to aid industries struggling in the face of tough foreign competition.

That feels familiar.

“The intensification of foreign competition meant that the political pressures for import restrictions increased dramatically,” explained Douglas Irwin in Clashing Over Commerce, his indispensable history of U.S. trade policy. “The Reagan administration responded by limiting imports in many sectors, but also resisted congressional pressure to do more, particularly with respect to Japan.”

But Reagan's methods were different from those of the current president. Thorndike notes that Reagan pursued international agreements to reduce trade barriers and provide mechanisms for resolving trade disputes and embraced those institutions when attempting to resolve trade disputes over the course of his presidency. And, Thorndike says, Reagan was especially optimistic about the benefits of free trade on the North American continent.

That doesn’t mean that Reagan didn’t take a pro-American stance. He declared, “I believe that if trade is not fair for all, then trade is free in name only. I will not stand by and watch American businesses fail because of unfair trading practices abroad. I will not stand by and watch American workers lose their jobs because other nations do not play by the rules.”

Thorndike says this was tough talk — and good politics, too.

Trivia

We’ve seen a string of IRS Commissioners and Acting IRS Commissioners in 2025. On the other end of the spectrum, which IRS Commissioner holds the record as the longest-serving IRS Commissioner?

(A) David Blair

(B) Guy T. Helvering

(C) Joseph S. Miller

(D) Green B. Raum

Find the answer at the bottom of this newsletter.

Positions And Guidance

The IRS has published Internal Revenue Bulletin 2025-33.

In a letter submitted to the Treasury and the IRS, the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) submitted comments on the recently enacted section 174A, which addresses the treatment of domestic research and experimental (R&E) expenditures (domestic research costs). The AICPA is urging Treasury and the IRS to issue immediate guidance that would allow eligible small business taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic research costs on their originally filed 2024 federal income tax returns rather than being required to capitalize those amounts.

Noteworthy

A Pennsylvania proposal, which unanimously passed the House and has moved to the Senate, would update state law to explicitly exempt privately-owned campgrounds from local amusement and admission taxes.

Consumers are rushing out to buy electric vehicles (EV) before the $7,500 tax break for EVs expires. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates the tax credit after September 30, 2025. According to Cox Automotive data, consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest monthly sales tally on record. The July figures represent a 26.4% increase from June and nearly 20% increase year-over-year.

Trivia Answer

The answer is (B).

Guy T. Helvering holds the record as the longest-serving IRS commissioner, with a tenure of ten years and four months, from June 6, 1933, to October 8, 1943. David Blair served eight years, Joseph S. Miller served six years, nine months, and Green B. Raum (yes, that’s a real name) served six years and nine months.

The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 set a five-year term of office for IRS Commissioners. Charles Rossotti was the first IRS Commissioner impacted by the new law—he served the full five years, from November 1997 to November 2002.

If approved, the changes would effectively rescind all greenhouse gas regulations for motor vehicles and engines.
Collectively, those two findings serve as a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.
If the proposal is approved, EPA will no longer have authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
Other potential rollbacks The vehicle emission regulations aren’t the only EPA standards on the chopping block.","When President Donald Trump came into office for a second term, he vowed to roll back environmental regulations he considered burdensome to commerce. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to go a step further than just easing regulations. In July, the agency issued a rule proposal to rescind two key scientific conclusions underpinning the basis for many greenhouse gas emission rules under the Clean Water Act.

If approved, the changes would effectively rescind all greenhouse gas regulations for motor vehicles and engines. Some ag advocacy organizations see this development as beneficial to U.S. farmers. Jordan Dux, senior director of national affairs at the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, said mandatory Tier 4 diesel emission systems add “tens of thousands to equipment” price tags.

That cost burden doesn’t evaporate away from the dealer lot.

“A vast majority of repairs that new agriculture equipment undergo are emissions-related,” Dux said. “Those systems go down and shut the whole tractor down. Producers can’t work during crunch time. When it comes to planting and harvest, that crunch time is important.”

Greenhouse gas emission standards

Citing several recent advocacy trips to Washington, Dux expressed optimism that the regulations might relax in the coming months.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposal July 29 to rescind two Obama-era scientific findings regarding greenhouse gases, the Endangerment Finding, and the Cause or Contribute Finding.

Codified in 2009, the first determined that “current and projected concentrations of six key well-mixed greenhouse gases” in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations:

The Cause or Contribute Finding concluded motor vehicle emissions contributed to greenhouse gas pollution, threatening public health and welfare. Collectively, those two findings serve as a prerequisite for implementing greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.

“The Obama administration moved mountains when they did their endangerment finding. That was the genesis for EPA regulation of greenhouse gases as a pollutant. The Trump administration is working to overturn that, if you will,” Dux explains.

Argument against emission regulations

According to Zeldin, the two findings have been used to “justify over $1 trillion in regulations.” He also believes his rule change will ultimately lower the cost of living and give consumers more choices. He also questions the science underpinning the original laws.

“In our work so far, many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said when he announced the change. “We heard loud and clear the concern that EPA’s GHG emission standards themselves, not carbon dioxide, which the Finding never assessed independently, was the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods.”

Dux said, besides inflating new machinery prices, the emission regulations have a downstream impact on used equipment. Machinery built before 2009, which does not require an emission system, is in higher demand and maintains a higher value. He said American farmers would broadly benefit from regulatory rollbacks.

“We live in very competitive global economy when it comes to agriculture. We want to make sure that U.S. farmers and ranchers have a fair playing field when it comes to producing product at a profitable level,” he said, noting several recent advocacy trips to Washington.

If the proposal is approved, EPA will no longer have authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The rule proposal was added to the Federal Register on Aug. 1 and is now subject to a 90-day public comment period.

Other potential rollbacks

The vehicle emission regulations aren’t the only EPA standards on the chopping block. In March, the Trump administration announced plans to pull back on the Biden-era Waters of the United States rule, which defines the scope of federal protection for the nation’s waterways under the Clean Water Act. As it stands now, Dux said the WOTUS regulation cedes too much control to federal agencies over farming practices.

“The federal government requires producers to apply for a permit to do pesticide applications or planting or anything that disturbs an area that maybe only runs with water during a heavy rain,” Dux said, noting regulatory agencies are “under no obligation to grant that permit. That’s the bigger issue. It really comes down to federal control over private property, and the ability of the federal EPA to say ‘no’ to a producer when he wants to do basic farming, planting, harvesting and crop protection product application.”

Additionally, Dux highlighted a recent “massive overhaul” of federal pesticide regulations, which he expects to greatly benefit farmers.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt6445ceb789b304d5/66f1e2e93331ef1af83516fa/Getty_Images_Scott_Olson_combine_and_grain_cart_at_harvest_1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-09 14:05:43.205069

The American Clean Power Association (ACP), the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), and Advanced Energy United issued the following statement after jointly filing a rehearing request, urging the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to reconsider its recently issued protocol aimed at assessing risks to grid reliability and security:

“As demand for energy surges, grid reliability must rely on sound modeling, reasonable forecasts, and unbiased analysis of all technologies. Instead, DOE’s protocol relies on inaccurate and inconsistent assumptions that undercut the credibility of certain technologies in favor of others. Americans deserve to have confidence that the government is taking advantage of ready-to-deploy and affordable resources to support communities across the country. Clean energy technologies are the fastest growing sources of American-made energy that are ready to keep prices down and meet demand.

Providing a roadmap that offers a clear-eyed view of risk is critical to meeting soaring demand across the country. The Department of Energy report missed the opportunity to present all the viable types of energy needed to address reliability and keep energy affordable. We urge DOE to reevaluate and enable those charged with securing and future-proofing our grid to meet the moment with every available resource.”

CHAGRIN FALLS, Ohio (AP) — A significant share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions comes from heating, cooling and powering homes — about 15%, according to one estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. So if you want to reduce your carbon footprint, the home is an effective place to start.

There are so many factors involved in a household’s energy consumption, including whether you have gas or electric heat and how you use your kitchen appliances, washer and dryer. It’s often overwhelming to figure out where to begin.

That’s why experts recommend a home energy assessment conducted by a professional. The room-by-room examinations help homeowners determine energy use, discover inefficiencies and create a plan to reduce both. In addition to helping the environment, improving efficiency saves money over the long term.

The assessments typically last several hours and cost anywhere from $100 to more than $1,000. Until the end of the year, the Inflation Reduction Act, a major U.S. climate law passed in 2022, helps cover the cost. Congress recently rescinded many of those benefits, which will be phased out.

I’m a climate reporter, so I’ve written about responsible energy use more than a few times. But in May, after years of apartment-dwelling, I moved into the first home I’ve ever owned.

So, I signed up for a home energy assessment.

My home, outside of Cleveland, is more than 100 years old. When I blast the air conditioning, it’s still hot and humid upstairs. I can hear birds chirping outside no matter how hard I shut the windows. And there’s a giant pipe in my basement held together by duct tape and prayers.

My assessment delivered pretty bad news. But with it came with lots of room for improvement. Here’s how the day unfolded:

The HVAC tests

Tim Portman, owner of the HVAC company Portman Mechanical in northeast Ohio, started with an hourlong interview about my goals of having a more comfortable and climate-friendly house. Then he headed into the basement to test my furnace, air conditioner and water heater.

The water heater pressure was normal, so Portman said there was no major risk of a water burst. However, the pressure in both the furnace and air conditioner was too high.

Which reveals my first problem: They are too big for the duct work. That’s inefficient, and it wears on the equipment. Making matters worse, Portman noticed a bunch of unnecessary turns in the ducts.

He equated it to having great water pressure in a kinked garden hose.

“If you don’t get the kink out of that garden hose, you’re never going to have a good experience,” he said.

The highlight of my basement woes was a giant pipe that feeds heating and cooling to the rest of the house. It just … wasn’t connected. It was jammed together like two straws without a junction. It bugged him enough that he paused to fix it.

And who am I to stop him?

The blower door

After the basement, Portman assembled a contraption called a blower door. He jammed a bunch of airtight plastic in my front doorway, shoved a big fan through the middle and turned it on so that it was blowing air out of my house.

“It literally sets up a vacuum in the house. So anywhere where there are leaks, you can see where those leaks are,” he said.

Seconds later, my home got hot and musty as the fan pulled outdoor air through all the leaky seams. Portman guessed the primary culprit immediately. I followed him upstairs into what felt like a sauna near the opening to the attic.

“You literally have hot, humid air — and your attic’s warmer than outside — just pouring into the second floor,” Portman said.

The blower door measures how many cubic feet of air flow through per minute. In a well-sealed house, the number should be less than or equal to the square footage. In my 1,500 square-foot (139-square-meter) house, the blower door number was 4,500. Three times as leaky as it should be.

Portman called it a worst-case scenario.

“It’s like driving your car around with the AC on and the windows rolled down,” he said.

The thermal camera

Next, Portman grabbed a thermal camera. The goal, since it was 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) outside, was to see if leaks would show up as hot spots on the camera.

There were a lot. On the screen, yellow revealed a hot spot. The coolest spaces were dark blue. The leaky door frame around the attic lit up bright yellow.

“Do you think that’s a problem?” Portman joked.

“Oops,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said. “Oops is the right answer.”

There were a few unsurprising finds, including a leaky bathroom fan and gaps around the hundred-year-old windows. Downstairs we also found major gaps in the living room’s exposed beams.

Thermal images proved Portman’s theory that my walls were not insulated. That’s because my house still has some knob and tube wiring, a system of ceramic supports and porcelain-wrapped wires that’s a relic of the early 20th century. Because of how it heats up, only certain insulation can be used with it. It can also be very expensive to remove.

In the basement, the camera revealed major gaps next to pipes and some other just … random holes. They were maybe where wiring used to be, or just hollow spots in the old wooden framing. But the air seepage was strong enough to make the cobwebs flutter frantically, as if reflecting my dread discovering them.

The verdict

After his review, Portman’s first recommendation was to call an electrician about the old wiring.

“Getting knob and tube out of your house opens the door to have insulation in your walls,” he said.

Once that’s addressed, Portman said I need to upgrade my electrical panel to support an eventual switch to a heat pump and an electric water heater, though those appliances don’t fit my budget this year.

One electrician I spoke to by phone guessed it would cost $30,000 to remove the old wiring. But another said as long as he inspects the wiring and doesn’t find any dangerous modifications, I could leave it and replace the panel for roughly $3,000.

I went with the second guy.

Through the end of 2025, federal tax credits will help subsidize weatherization upgrades, including insulation, windows, doors and electrical panels.

In the meantime, my husband and I have a different homework assignment: use a caulk gun and spray foam to plug the holes that we found on the thermal camera.

Between July heat waves and January cold snaps, sealing a house in the Cleveland area isn’t just good for the planet. It’s a good investment.

That includes credits for upgrades like rooftop solar panels, upgraded windows, and electric heat pumps, which could save people thousands of dollars.

According to The New York Times, you can still claim some savings if you take action before the end of the year. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which covers 30% of the cost of things like insulation and the previously mentioned upgrades, is still available. The max is $2,000 for heat pumps or water heaters, plus up to $1,200 more for other upgrades.

Installers say not to wait since permitting and inspections can take weeks.

""You might only have until October or November,"" Brett Bouchy, CEO of solar company Freedom Forever, said, per the Times.

More specifically, according to Canary Media, the Big Beautiful Bill puts more than 600 gigawatts' worth of solar at risk, including the wind and battery projects that could have come to fruition after 2027. The Times article explained specifically that credits for rooftop solar installations are now scheduled to expire 180 days after the bill's signing instead of sticking to continuing through 2032.

Twelve states have since had to pause their energy rebate programs. As early as March 2025, CPR News reported that Colorado paused a $140 million federally funded program that was meant to help low- and middle-income households upgrade. Although a federal court overturned the freeze and funds were restored, state officials have warned there is still no firm launch date for those home upgrade discounts.

For people who don't owe enough taxes to use those credits, two rebate programs from 2022 — the HEAR Program and the HOMES Program — that were funded with $9 billion can still be used. Together, these rebates can add up to as much as $14,000 per household according to the report.

One covers electric upgrades like heat pumps, induction stoves, and new wiring for households that are making less than 150% of their local median income. The other is for efficiency upgrades in homes under 80% of the local median income.

During a news conference at Embaras bar and grill in Villa Grove, owner Ryan Garett said his energy costs have skyrocketed in just one month.

“You get a $3,000 bill when you’re not really expecting it. It raises your costs $1,000 in a month, you can’t budget for that,” Garett said. “You can’t plan for that. And then, it has a trickle down effect. We’re at the point where we’ve had to cut back on hours for some of our employees and take up those hours ourselves because we can’t, you know, keep up with payroll to pay that stuff.”

State Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville, said while Gov. J.B. Pritzker blames the increased costs on grid operators and President Donald Trump, Democrats need reverse course.

“The very communities the governor and his allies claim to help have been abandoned under [the Clean and Equitable Jobs Act] and its predecessor to the Future Energy Jobs Act of 2016, Illinois has been shutting down affordable, reliable coal and natural gas plants, so sources that actually work and are critical to grid stability,” Halbrook said. “But why? To appease the climate alarmists who think we can power Illinois with windmills and wishful thinking.”

State Rep. Chris Miller, R-Oakland, said it’s time to ditch the “green energy scam.”

“We have over 200 billion tons of big, beautiful coal available. All we have to do is go get it,” Miller said. “It would be a tremendous driver for jobs and opportunity. This whole CEJA thing, this whole green energy scam needs to be thrown in the garbage where it belongs.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition put the blame on increased energy prices on the Trump administration’s roll backs of tax incentives for “clean energy” and “Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.”

“As new federal policies make our power dirtier and more expensive, it is crucial that Illinois lawmakers can step up to the plate this fall and pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability (CRGA) Act to protect families from utility bill spikes, preserve and grow our clean energy workforce, and maintain our national leadership on climate action,” the coalition said in a news release.

The acquisition includes the Northvolt Ett, Ett Expansion, and Northvolt Labs facilities in Sweden, as well as Northvolt Drei in Germany.
“Lyten is actively progressing discussions with Northvolt North America, the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec and other key local stakeholders,” the company wrote on Aug. 7 in a statement.
In November of 2024, Lyten also acquired Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California.
“It underscores the promising foundations established through the Northvolt project and Quebec’s potential role in the growth of the North American battery ecosystem,” she said in a statement.","Lyten, an American company, has announced it hopes to purchase the Northvolt battery plant in Quebec.

This comes after the company shared on Aug. 7 that it entered into a deal to buy Northvolt’s assets in Sweden and Germany.

The acquisition includes the Northvolt Ett, Ett Expansion, and Northvolt Labs facilities in Sweden, as well as Northvolt Drei in Germany. Lyten will also acquire all of Northvolt’s remaining intellectual property. The value of the transaction has not been disclosed.

The San Jose, Calif.-based company now has its sights set on Quebec.

In its press release announcing the acquisition of the Swedish and German assets, it said it’s “committed to pursuing the acquisition” of the Northvolt Six project in the Montérégie region.

The $7-billion factory is expected to be built between Saint-Basile-le-Grand and McMasterville.

“Lyten is actively progressing discussions with Northvolt North America, the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec and other key local stakeholders,” the company wrote on Aug. 7 in a statement.

The U.S. company, founded in 2015, currently manufactures lithium-sulphur batteries in the Silicon Valley and markets them to the drone and defence markets.

The company’s takeover in Sweden and Germany follows its purchase of another Northvolt plant in Poland in early July, and the Swedish company’s product portfolio and intellectual property for battery energy storage systems weeks later.

In November of 2024, Lyten also acquired Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California.

In a post on X, Quebec Economy Minister Christine Fréchette said the Quebec government intends to meet with Lyten representatives to hear “what they have to offer.”

She added the province has “leverage to regulate or refuse” the purchase, adding “it’s our responsibility to rigorously assess this new situation.”

Karen Chang, interim CEO of Northvolt North America, said she’s “encouraged by strong interest expressed by Lyten” in the subsidiary.

“It underscores the promising foundations established through the Northvolt project and Quebec’s potential role in the growth of the North American battery ecosystem,” she said in a statement.

Northvolt filed for bankruptcy in Sweden on March 12. This came following an “exhaustive effort to explore all available means to secure a viable financial and operational future for the company,” the North American branch said then.

At that time, Fréchette had said she hoped the company would find another buyer willing to take over its activities in North America.

The Quebec government invested $270 million in Northvolt’s Swedish parent company before it filed for bankruptcy in Europe.

Impact on Renewable Energy Sectors Renewable energy companies, particularly those reliant on federal grants and regulatory frameworks, face significant headwinds.
Renewable energy sectors, especially cleantech manufacturing and infrastructure deployment, are labor-intensive and often depend on unionized workforces for skilled labor.
The EPA's union policy shifts could exacerbate labor shortages, as union-backed training programs and grievance mechanisms are weakened.
While the immediate effects on renewable energy and labor markets are disruptive, the long-term trajectory will depend on the resilience of state-level initiatives and the adaptability of private-sector players.","The termination of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) contracts with federal unions under the Trump administration represents a seismic shift in labor relations and regulatory priorities. This move, justified under a March 2025 executive order invoking national security, has effectively dismantled collective bargaining rights for over 8,000 EPA employees. While the administration frames this as a necessary step to streamline operations, the broader implications for renewable energy and labor market-linked equities are profound and multifaceted.

The Political and Economic Context

The EPA's decision to terminate contracts with unions such as the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Association of Government Employees (NAGE) is part of a broader anti-union agenda. By revoking collective bargaining agreements, the agency has shifted power dynamics in favor of management, allowing for greater flexibility in workforce restructuring. This includes the reclamation of office space used by union representatives and the prohibition of union activities during work hours. The move has been met with fierce legal resistance, with AFGE vowing to challenge the decision in court, arguing it violates the First Amendment and undermines the EPA's environmental mission.

The ripple effects extend beyond labor relations. The EPA's restructuring, including a 23% workforce reduction and the elimination of environmental justice (EJ) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, signals a strategic realignment toward deregulation and cost-cutting. This aligns with the Trump administration's broader “Great American Comeback” initiative, which prioritizes fossil fuel expansion and reduced federal oversight.

Impact on Renewable Energy Sectors

Renewable energy companies, particularly those reliant on federal grants and regulatory frameworks, face significant headwinds. The cancellation of the Solar for All program—a $7 billion initiative under the Inflation Reduction Act—exemplifies this. Designed to support solar adoption in low- and middle-income households, the program was a critical driver of job creation and infrastructure development. Its termination not only disrupts existing projects but also erodes confidence in long-term federal support for clean energy.

The labor market implications are equally stark. Renewable energy sectors, especially cleantech manufacturing and infrastructure deployment, are labor-intensive and often depend on unionized workforces for skilled labor. The EPA's union policy shifts could exacerbate labor shortages, as union-backed training programs and grievance mechanisms are weakened. This may drive up costs for renewable energy projects, which already face challenges from supply chain bottlenecks and trade protections like 2024 solar and battery tariffs.

Investment Implications and Strategic Considerations

For investors, the key lies in navigating the dual forces of regulatory uncertainty and sector-specific resilience. Renewable energy equities tied to federal grants, such as First Solar or Sunrun, may face near-term volatility as legal challenges over Solar for All unfold. Conversely, companies with diversified revenue streams—such as NextEra Energy, which operates utility-scale renewables—may be better insulated from policy shifts.

The labor market dynamics also warrant attention. While the EPA's actions could reduce union influence in federal agencies, state-level initiatives in states like New York and California are likely to sustain demand for clean energy jobs. Investors should monitor state-level incentives and workforce development programs, which may offset federal retrenchment.

The Path Forward

The legal battles over the EPA's union terminations and Solar for All cancellation will be pivotal. A favorable ruling for unions could restore collective bargaining rights and stabilize labor markets, while a victory for the administration may accelerate the erosion of federal worker protections. Investors must weigh these outcomes against the broader trend of political polarization and its impact on regulatory consistency.

In the renewable energy sector, the focus should shift toward technologies and projects less reliant on federal grants. Energy storage, hydrogen production, and circular economy innovations are emerging as resilient areas, offering long-term growth potential. Additionally, companies that prioritize partnerships with educational institutions and apprenticeship programs may better navigate labor shortages and skill gaps.

Conclusion

The EPA's union policy shifts under Trump reflect a broader ideological clash over the role of government in labor and environmental regulation. While the immediate effects on renewable energy and labor markets are disruptive, the long-term trajectory will depend on the resilience of state-level initiatives and the adaptability of private-sector players. For investors, the key is to balance caution with strategic foresight, prioritizing sectors and companies that can thrive in an era of regulatory flux. The coming months will test not only the durability of clean energy transitions but also the adaptability of capital markets in the face of political uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 14:04:48.505261

Dubbed the ""devastation bill"" by its detractors, the text recently adopted by lawmakers would have loosened environmental licensing laws for projects considered ""strategic"" by the state.

For some permits, all that would have been required is a simple declaration of the company's environmental commitment.

Lula instead reinstated the current strict licensing rules for strategic projects, such as a controversial oil mega-project at the mouth of the Amazon river, but set a one-year deadline for them to be approved or rejected.

His veto also ensures that several Indigenous territories and the Atlantic Forest, which stretches along the east coast, will continue to enjoy special protection, Environment Minister Marina Silva told reporters.

SOS Atlantic Forest, a non-governmental organization that had garnered over a million signatures calling for a veto of the law, hailed Lula's decision as ""a victory"" for environmental protection.

Greenpeace also praised the leftist president's action on the issue.

But the executive coordinator of APIB, Brazil's largest Indigenous rights group, told AFP he was disappointed that the president had not struck down the entire bill.

Lula's veto must now be ratified by Congress, which is dominated by conservatives.

Lula's environmental credentials are under close scrutiny in the run-up to the annual UN climate summit, which he will host in November in the Amazon city of Belem.

While seeking to take a leadership role on climate change on the global stage, Lula has faced criticism at home for backing drilling in the Equatorial Margin, along the country's northern coast.

He argues that the revenue from the oil field is necessary to finance Brazil's energy transition.

Silva said Lula's objective was to ensure that ""the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation.""

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution,” the Oregon delegation wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought. “Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.”

The $86.6 million grant went to the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) to deploy a statewide Solar for All Program in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon. The funds—which were awarded under the historic Ley de Reducción de la Inflación and fully obligated—are intended to help create Oregon’s only statewide residential solar incentive program, but without them, working families across the state will struggle to harness the power of clean solar energy.

The lawmakers emphasized, “If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year.

Como Ranking Member of the Senate Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee and a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, Merkley has led the charge to hold the EPA accountable for its disastrous funding freezes that have previously targeted the Solar for All program. He continues to use his position as the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees funding for the EPA to ensure the agency follows the law and has the necessary resources to carry out its mission of protecting human health and the environment.

“The EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program is a blatant failure of its duty to uphold enacted spending laws and ensure Americans have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Congress has yet to receive satisfactory responses and justifications for many of your unlawful and illogical actions. This is unacceptable and the agency must comply with the law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the livelihoods of all Americans and the environments where they live,” the delegation directed.

Mr. Zeldin and Mr. Vought:

We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution. Solar for All funds help families across the nation access reliable energy at an affordable price. Solar energy is one of the cheapest and most reliable forms of energy, and solar deployment is critical to meeting the nation’s rapid growth in energy demand. Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.

In 2024, the State of Oregon received an $86.6 million award from the EPA to develop a statewide Solar for All program. These funds, awarded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are fully obligated. Since January 2025, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) has worked diligently in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon to design a cost-effective program with a focus on efficient procurement and project planning while also building strong partnerships with local community-based organizations across the state.

If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year. Your recent actions have jeopardized these crucial services and stripped thousands of Oregonians of access to this cost-effective program.

If allowed to spend the federal funds it was legally awarded, the State of Oregon has plans to establish a program that would support solar panel installation on multi-family buildings and the development of community solar projects, while also investing in workforce development activities to ensure a robust and efficient solar industry in Oregon. This program would be the only statewide residential solar incentive program and without it, residential solar will not be a cost-effective option for low-income Oregonians. Now that the EPA has terminated federal Solar for All funds, thousands of low-income Oregonians will suffer from higher utility costs and less resilient energy sources.

The Solar for All program is crucial to meeting future energy needs in the Pacific Northwest while lowering household costs for working-class families. In Oregon, customers have suffered from exponentially increasing energy bills, with some utilities raising prices on residential households by 50% since 2020. Nationwide, the Solar for All program is on track to help more than 900,000 people install solar and reduce their electricity bills by at least 20 percent. The Solar for All program is designed to shield middle- and low-income families from these extreme price increases that place additional financial strain on households that are already struggling to pay their bills.

The EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program is a blatant failure of its duty to uphold enacted spending laws and ensure Americans have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Congress has yet to receive satisfactory responses and justifications for many of your unlawful and illogical actions. This is unacceptable and the agency must comply with the law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the livelihoods of all Americans and the environments where they live.

It predicted that, largely thanks to data centers, energy demand in the state would nearly double by 2030.
The most strenuous opposition to the Texas data center bill came from other Republicans.
While online services depend on data centers to keep operating, major tech companies can switch some workloads between locations.
The tech industry is exploring ways to reduce the burden that data centers place on electric grids.","The American electrical grid is creaking under growing demand from data centers that power websites, streaming platforms and Silicon Valley’s artificial intelligence boom. A new law in Texas introduced an unprecedented remedy: cut power to the energy-guzzling facilities in times of emergency.

Lawmakers who championed the law say giving the Texas grid operator that option will help avoid deadly blackouts like those that followed a 2021 winter storm in which more than 200 people died. State regulators are now hashing out how to implement data center shutoffs with industry leaders.

The willingness of Republicans in a red state that is a major hub for data centers to impose new regulations on the facilities underscores how even those enthusiastic about participating in the AI revolution can be hampered by the limits of the country’s aging infrastructure.

The narrow prospects for adding new energy sources to the grid may be cut further by President Donald Trump’s recently passed tax law, even as data centers contribute to rising electricity rates.

Texas, with its wide open spaces, cheap energy and pro-business policies, is a natural home for data centers, warehouse-like buildings stocked with powerful computers that can consume comparable power to a small city.

The Lone Star State hosts data centers built by Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft. Abilene, in western Texas, is home to the first site of the Stargate AI data center project that, according to a January announcement hosted by Trump, aimed to “immediately” spend $100 billion.

Trump has made more data centers a national priority, recently seeking to accelerate their construction with a new national AI plan and an executive order that eases federal permitting.

But the fatal 2021 storm that left millions of Texas residents in the dark without heat while industrial operations stayed online provides a stark reminder of the dangers of overstretched energy infrastructure.

Last year, Texas power officials informed lawmakers that energy demand on the state’s grid could double in six years, threatening its reliability. The forecast set off a panic that led to the drafting of the law allowing data centers to be cut off in emergencies.

“We never want to risk another (Storm) Uri, where over 200 Texans died because they lost their electricity,” said Texas state Sen. Phil King, who co-wrote the bill, in a Feb. 27 hearing about the legislation, using an unofficial name for the storm. “That can never, ever happen again.”

An implementation process that began with a public meeting before the Texas Public Utility Commission late last month will determine when and how power can be cut to data centers under the new law, which was signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in June. The process will also specify new requirements for how the facilities pay for power and grid infrastructure upgrades.

Tyler Norris, a fellow at Duke University, said the process will be closely watched by lawmakers and energy leaders around the country as they grapple with electricity demand forecasts that are “physically impossible to meet.”

“It’s hard to overstate the significance in terms of the direction this is likely to push the data center industry,” Norris said. “When you have periods of system stress – demand exceeding supply – you get into load shedding … Unless a data center is providing a critical national security function, there’s going to be a push to curtail the data center first.”

‘The Wild West of data centers’

Days after Trump announced Stargate in an Oval Office live stream in January, OpenAI executives flew to Austin to discuss the project with state officials including Gov. Abbott. Stargate is a joint venture between the ChatGPT maker, business software giant Oracle and Japanese investor SoftBank. (The Washington Post has a content partnership with OpenAI.)

Texas leaders – like their counterparts in states including Ohio, Virginia and Arizona – have welcomed data center projects and the tax revenue they promise.

Two of the lobbyists OpenAI brought along to the Austin meeting, Daniel Hodge and Luis Saenz, had previously served as Abbott’s chief of staff. After the meeting, OpenAI’s global policy director Chris Lehane wrote a LinkedIn post thanking the governor for a “big Texas welcome.”

Behind the scenes, Republican state senators King and Charles Schwertner were preparing State Bill 6. It introduced measures aimed at ensuring tech companies pay their fair share for power transmission costs, and required any data center seeking a grid connection after Dec. 31 to build a switch that can be used to cut supply in an emergency.

The legislation was spurred by an ominous forecast in June 2024 testimony from the chief executive of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the nonprofit that manages the Texas electric grid. It predicted that, largely thanks to data centers, energy demand in the state would nearly double by 2030.

Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick called the forecast “shocking” in a social media post that month. “We want data centers,” he wrote, “but it can’t be the Wild Wild West of data centers.”

As the bill made its way through the Texas legislature, tech companies voiced concerns, including Crusoe and Lancium, partners of OpenAI and Oracle on the Stargate project in Abilene.

At a February hearing, Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, an industry group, warned of the “significant consequences” of even a “momentary interruption” to data center customers, which he said include governments, law enforcement, hospitals and banks.

Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, and Google are members of the Data Center Coalition.

The most strenuous opposition to the Texas data center bill came from other Republicans. In interviews and editorials this spring, Vance Ginn, a conservative and former Texas lobbyist who briefly worked for the White House Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term, argued that the regulation could make his state less attractive to tech industry dollars.

Ginn’s comments were followed by criticism from right-wing pundits and influencers who saw a potential threat to the Trump administration’s plans to see America dominate AI. At the time, Lt. Gov. Patrick’s office told Fox News he was aligned with Trump’s vision for AI in Texas.

“We have made clear we are in lockstep with President Trump on his goal to make America the premier destination for AI, data centers and cryptocurrency,” Patrick’s communications director Steven Aranyi told the Post.

Abbott signed the bill on June 20. His press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, said the governor acted “to ensure that, as Texas grows, ERCOT can effectively manage energy to meet rising demand.”

“Thanks to this law and increased investments in energy infrastructure, innovators know Texas has the tools needed to lead,” he said in an emailed statement.

White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement that Trump’s goal is to create “a golden age for American technological dominance” and that “state legislators and utility regulators need to be more open to facilitating data center development in a manner that ensures a productive and symbiotic relationship between grid operators, developers, and hyperscalers that does not impose unreasonable and onerous restrictions on the American tech companies on the frontier of AI development.”

New data centers are still incubating in Texas, where former Gov. Rick Perry announced plans for a nuclear-powered facility near Amarillo to be called the Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus. OpenAI has said it’s expanding Stargate in Abilene with a deal to add facilities that consume another 4.5 gigawatts of power.

Ginn, the former Trump staffer, said he remains concerned the new law creates “structural barriers to growth, innovation, and voluntary grid support at times we need it most.”

More flexible AI

The new regime for data centers in Texas could push tech companies to rethink how they operate the facilities.

In an extreme weather event, Texas must be able to “load shed as quickly as possible,” said Clif Lange of the South Texas Electric Cooperative. At the public meeting last month, he acknowledged that “bad things can potentially happen” when power to industrial customers is cut, but said some must find a way to be flexible.

While online services depend on data centers to keep operating, major tech companies can switch some workloads between locations. The facilities are also used for less time-sensitive work that can be paused or postponed.

The tech industry is exploring ways to reduce the burden that data centers place on electric grids.

Google on Monday announced deals with two utilities, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Indiana Michigan Power, that will see the internet company reduce its energy demand during periods of peak use by adjusting AI workloads running in its data centers. Chipmaker Nvidia has backed startup Emerald AI, which is developing software to help other data centers do the same thing.

Robin Hytowitz, a researcher with the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute, which is studying how data center flexibility could help electrical infrastructure, said the new Texas law is “the first state bill that really gave clarity around some of that emergency use.” It probably won’t be the last.

New Jersey is considering a law that would offer financial incentives to data centers to be more adaptable.

California state Sen. Steve Padilla has proposed legislation aimed at insulating residential grid customers from rate hikes due to data center demand. “We’ve got to try to figure out what happens when one of these things plugs in and starts drawing off the grid, and suddenly we have scarcities created that drive up cost on a scale that we haven’t seen before,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2025-08-09 12:05:00.028418

Chris Stark CBE, Head of Mission Control for Clean Power by 2030.","Britain must copy China and become a net zero “electrostate”, Ed Miliband’s top civil servant has said.

Chris Stark, the Energy Secretary’s “Head of Mission Control for Clean Power by 2030”, said the UK needed to match the speed of electrification seen in China in order to become a new global super-power as the world moves towards net zero.

Writing in The Telegraph, he said: “China, still the world’s largest consumer of coal, is now moving towards a cleaner future: laying vast networks of transmission lines, rolling out the world’s biggest fleet of electric vehicles, and deploying solar and wind at a scale that now dwarfs the rest of the world. We ignore these changes at our peril.”

Mr Stark argued that the world was moving from an era where petrostates, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, exerted significant global power thanks to their control of fuel sources, to one where clean energy economies will be dominant.

He wrote: “This isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s about cold, hard economics. India, Sweden and China and many other countries recognise the future is electric – the blueprint for a more efficient economy and the basis for economic dominance in the decades to come. Britain should be among these new electrostates.”

Mr Stark is one of the UK’s most influential experts on energy and climate, and was formerly chief executive of the Climate Change Committee, the Government’s advisory body.

He is now one of Mr Miliband’s closest allies, leading the “control centre” set up by the Energy Secretary immediately after Labour came to power intended to “turbocharge the Government’s mission to provide Britain with cheaper and clean power by 2030”.

His suggestion that Britain must copy China is likely to prove controversial.

China is already the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases and is still building coal-fired power stations. International Energy Agency data shows that its annual coal consumption rose from 1.3m tonnes in 2000 to 5bn tonnes now.

Claire Coutinho, the Conservative former energy secretary, now shadow energy spokeswoman, said: “China, unlike Labour, isn’t planning for a system that relies on wind and sun – they are still 60pc powered by coal and building more of it as well as every other type of energy. Living standards depend on having lots of cheap energy. That’s why we should back the North Sea and build a lot more nuclear.”

China has also been widely criticised for using “forced labour” to accelerate its renewable energy programme, with its Uyghurs minority forced into labour camps to make solar panels. Mr Miliband had ignored the issue till a backbench rebellion earlier this year forced him to legislate to ensure UK supply chains remained free of slavery.

Additionally, UK electricity costs four times more than gas, so such a shift could adversely impact bills. Ms Coutinho said: “If you want people to use electric cars and home heating, then it’s simple. You need to make electricity cheap.”

Mr Stark claimed that becoming an “electrostate” would eventually cut UK energy bills – currently among the world’s highest.

He said: “Our once-in-a-generation investment in our electricity grid across the country will allow renewables and nuclear to fulfil their promise of lowering bills for households and businesses, ensuring Britain is no longer hostage to volatile global gas markets.”

Britain must become an ‘electrostate’ like China

By Chris Stark

Two hundred years ago, Britain lit the fuse on the Industrial Revolution.

Coal, steam and steel transformed our economy, powered factories and propelled Britain’s global dominance. The countries who mastered these technologies have been the global leaders.

Today, the world is on the brink of another transformation – one that will be every bit as profound – this time powered by clean abundant electricity.

The global race is on to be among the first ‘electrostates’: nations whose economies run on abundant, affordable, low-carbon power, rapidly reducing their dependency on volatile, insecure oil and gas. And the stakes are clear: last year, $2 trillion poured into clean energy, double the investment in fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.

Look at Norway, where almost every home is heated with electricity and nine in 10 new cars are electric. Sweden is producing fossil-free steel, aiming to dominate the industries of the 21st century.

But it is Asia where we see the biggest changes, as growing energy demand drives a rapid shift towards clean energy. China, still the world’s largest consumer of coal, is now moving towards a cleaner future: laying vast networks of transmission lines, rolling out the world’s biggest fleet of electric vehicles, and deploying solar and wind at a scale that now dwarfs the rest of the world. We ignore these changes at our peril.

This isn’t just about cutting emissions. It’s about cold, hard economics. India, Sweden and China and many other countries recognise the future is electric – it’s the blueprint for a more efficient economy and the basis for economic dominance in the decades to come. Britain should be among these new electrostates.

It makes economic sense but it is also an opportunity for better lives for people in Britain, whether that be warmer homes, cleaner air, new jobs and control over our energy.

That’s why over the past year I’ve been tasked with laying the foundations to lead this global race through our clean power by 2030 mission. We have approved clean energy projects that could power over two million homes, attracted over £50bn in private sector investment for clean energy industries, and backed nuclear power at scale – signing off a multi-billion-pound deal for Sizewell C that will deliver clean power for the equivalent of six million homes and support 10,000 jobs at peak construction.

This complements work to launch first-of-a-kind carbon capture projects in the UK and introduced plans to upgrade millions of homes with clean technologies to cut bills for homeowners and renters.

These are big and bold energy policy decisions that are required for Britain’s reindustrialisation. We’re going to be powered by electricity in the decades to come, so we need to start acting like it.

This past week our annual renewables auction opened for applications. The Contracts for Difference scheme has been a notable British success in securing clean energy, creating jobs, strengthening local economies and attracting investment.

Britain’s greatest asset is our abundant offshore wind. Take Hornsea Two. Supported through the scheme, it now powers over 1.4 million British homes and supports 600 jobs in places like Grimsby and Hull. The Sofia offshore wind farm in the North Sea is projected to contribute £760m to the UK economy – up to £181m of that in Yorkshire and the Humber alone.

These mega projects are drivers of growth. That’s why investment in clean energy is so important. Our mission is the start of a new era of clean energy abundance, where plentiful British wind and solar drives down energy costs, creates jobs, and gives our industries a global competitive edge.

Britain has a head start on the shift to clean power, but if we can’t match – and in some areas beat – the pace of other countries’ deployment, we risk the industries of tomorrow taking root elsewhere.

We have every advantage – world-class engineering, a strong track record in renewables and some of the best natural resources for abundant power anywhere in the world. With the clarity of our clean power mission, we aim to secure the commitment of our clean industries and build their confidence to invest in Britain.

This is the next chapter of Britain’s industrial story. The scale of investment will bring new economic opportunities to communities in Wales, Teesside, Norfolk and the Humber. It will support new energy jobs in Scotland as our oil and gas resources begin to dwindle. Our once-in-a-generation investment in our electricity grid across the country will allow renewables and nuclear to fulfil their promise of lowering bills for households and businesses, ensuring Britain is no longer hostage to volatile global gas markets.

Two centuries ago, Britain’s embrace of coal and steam shaped the modern world. An industrial boom, based on domestically sourced energy and astonishing technological innovations. Fast forward to 2025, it is now clean power that provides the economic opportunity of the century.

The more renewable and nuclear power we can connect to our grid, the quicker we will displace imported gas and decouple consumer prices from expensive imports. The faster we adopt electrical technologies, for our heating and cooling, for our transport and our industry, the easier it will be to maximise the use our domestic energy resources.

The electrostates have already committed to a future powered by the wind, the sun and nuclear. That is Britain’s path too. We must not watch from the sidelines as others claim the rewards.

Conclusion: The Future Is Electric, But Not Without Nuance The Tesla Model Y emerges as the clear winner in long-term cost efficiency, driven by energy savings and maintenance advantages.","The energy transition is reshaping the automotive landscape, and investors must now weigh not just upfront costs but the long-term financial implications of electric vehicles (EVs) versus traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. This analysis compares the Tesla Model Y and the Subaru Forester over a 10-year ownership horizon, focusing on total cost of ownership (TCO), energy transition trends, and strategic investment considerations.

1. Initial Cost and Incentives: A Tale of Two Markets

The Tesla Model Y starts at $44,990 for the Long Range RWD variant in 2025, while the Subaru Forester begins at $31,415 for the Base trim. However, incentives tilt the scales. The Model Y qualifies for a $7,500 federal EV tax credit (if sourced and assembled in North America), effectively reducing its net cost to $37,490. This credit expires on September 30, 2025, creating urgency for buyers.

The Forester, lacking an EV tax credit, relies on the car loan interest tax deduction under the 2025 ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA). While this deduction allows up to $10,000/year in interest write-offs, only 1% of buyers qualify due to strict income and loan terms. For most, the Forester's lower base price remains its primary advantage.

2. Maintenance and Fuel Costs: Where EVs Shine

Electric vehicles outperform ICE vehicles in maintenance efficiency. The Model Y's annual maintenance costs average $949, compared to the Forester's $1,279—a 31% savings. Over 10 years, this translates to $3,300 in cumulative savings, driven by fewer oil changes, spark plugs, and transmission services. Tesla's 8–10 year battery warranty (covering 100,000–150,000 miles) further reduces long-term repair risks.

Fuel/charging costs tell an even clearer story. At $0.12–$0.24/kWh, the Model Y costs $500–$800/year to charge for 15,000 miles. Over a decade, this totals $5,000–$8,000. The Forester, burning $3.70/gallon gas at 25 mpg, incurs $2,220/year in fuel costs, or $22,200 over 10 years—nearly three times the EV's energy cost.

3. Insurance and Resale Value: The Hidden Trade-Offs

Insurance for EVs is 15% more expensive on average, with the Model Y costing $2,000–$4,000/year versus the Forester's $1,900. Over 10 years, this adds $10,000–$20,000 in higher costs for Tesla, offsetting some of its operational savings.

Resale value, however, favors the Forester. The Model Y is projected to retain 21% of its original value after 10 years (resale: $10,791), while the Forester's historical performance suggests 30–35% retention (resale: $9,425–$10,995). This gap narrows as EV adoption grows, but ICE vehicles still hold an edge in used markets, particularly in regions with limited charging infrastructure.

4. Energy Transition: The Long Game

The 2035 energy transition policies are pivotal. Electrification is expected to reduce electricity costs and stabilize energy prices, while gas remains volatile. By 2035, EVs could be cheaper to own than gas vehicles in 90% of U.S. states, per the 2035 Report 2.0.

For investors, this means Tesla's market share in EVs (and its stock performance) will likely outpace traditional automakers. Meanwhile, Subaru's ICE-focused strategy may face headwinds as ZEV mandates tighten.

5. Strategic Investment Takeaways

For Short-Term Holders (0–3 Years): The Forester's lower upfront cost and higher resale value make it a safer bet.

For Long-Term Holders (5–10 Years): The Model Y's $14,200–$17,200 savings in fuel and maintenance outweigh higher insurance and depreciation, especially with tax credits.

Energy Transition Playbook: Invest in EV infrastructure (e.g., charging networks) and renewable energy stocks to capitalize on the shift. Avoid overexposure to ICE automakers, as regulatory tailwinds favor electrification.

Conclusion: The Future Is Electric, But Not Without Nuance

The Tesla Model Y emerges as the clear winner in long-term cost efficiency, driven by energy savings and maintenance advantages. However, its higher insurance costs and depreciation must be balanced against the broader energy transition narrative. The Subaru Forester remains a reliable, cost-effective ICE option for the near term but risks obsolescence as ZEV mandates accelerate.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 13:03:19.184645

With specific competitors facing operational and market challenges, First Solar is well-positioned to strengthen its leadership in the U.S. renewable energy sector. However, given the cyclical nature of the solar industry, FSLR may not be ideally suited for a long-term buy-and-hold strategy. Even so, the medium-term prospects remain highly attractive, and my outlook is confidently Bullish.

Strong Q2 Results Stabilize the Bull Case

In Q2, First Solar achieved earnings per share (EPS) of $3.18, which significantly beat the consensus estimate of $2.66. This is a modest decline from the $3.25 reported in Q2 2024. Revenue came in at $1.10 billion for the quarter, which means it meaningfully surpasses the consensus estimate of $1.05 billion. The revenue figure represents a moderate increase from the $1.01 billion reported in the same quarter last year.

The cornerstone of the bull case is management’s decision to raise full-year guidance to $4.9–$5.7 billion, up from the prior range of $4.5–$5.5 billion. Full-year EPS guidance was also tightened to $13.50–$16.50, compared to the earlier $12.50–$17.50 range.

This upward revision, along with strong quarterly results, was driven primarily by higher module sales volumes and improved average selling prices. Management emphasized that the Inflation Reduction Act’s Section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credits continue to provide a direct profitability boost for U.S.-produced modules—although phase-outs are now set to accelerate.

Unlike many competitors, First Solar has minimal exposure to China and operates a supply chain that is largely U.S.-based. This structure enables the company to comply easily with the “Foreign Entity of Concern” (FEOC) rules under the OBBBA, which are far more challenging for peers with less transparent supply chains. Firms that fail to meet FEOC requirements will soon have limited or no access to the 45X tax credits, giving First Solar a significant competitive advantage.

First Solar’s Valuation Remains Attractive

Based on my analysis, First Solar stock is currently fairly valued. That means the investment case is still active due to normalized EPS growth of 55% expected for Fiscal 2026, and 20% annually for Fiscal 2027 and 2028. However, it’s worth keeping in mind that as the solar industry has cyclical tendencies, it’s essential to monitor how long the current demand for solar power capacity expansion lasts. For the time being, FSLR’s latest revenue figures showed the best revenue print since 2020, according to TipRanks data.

The good news is that with so much AI demand and the advent of robotics at scale on the horizon, energy is going to be in short supply. With reshoring trends and the cost efficiencies of solar power, I think First Solar has a powerful long-term return horizon.

Sleeping on FSLR is ill-advised because history tells us demand for solar power products is highly dependent on interest rates and macroeconomic health. A real recession in the next four to five years would likely cause FSLR to plummet at the first sign of macroeconomic contraction approaching.

That said, this is no longer a value opportunity; it’s a growth-at-a-reasonable-price stock. So, we’re probably looking at 20% annual returns from here, given that’s what consensus EPS estimates also suggest.

Alternatively, if AI demand causes a long-term surge in solar power demand, annual returns could surge to 25-30% over the next three years. However, that optionality is heavily dependent on solar power being a preferred form of power generation over the likes of coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy, all of which are gaining attention, albeit at different rates depending on geography.

Is FSLR Stock a Good Buy?

On Wall Street, First Solar has a consensus Strong Buy rating based on 17 Buys, zero Holds, and one Sell. FSLR’s average stock price target is $223, which indicates ~20% upside over the next 12 months.

I view Wall Street’s estimates as conservative yet generally reasonable. Current sentiment toward First Solar is neutral-to-positive, with potential upside from rising macro energy demand tempered by near-term limitations in policy-related benefits—though these constraints are impacting competitors more than FSLR.

According to TipRanks’ stock comparison tool, FSLR is the leading contender in the solar energy space:

FSLR is Well-Positioned in Crowded Market

First Solar has been one of my top performers over the past six months, and I believe the upside story is far from over. The position currently represents 4.4% of my portfolio, and factors such as the OBBBA’s FEOC rules—likely to hinder competitors—reinforce my confidence in its medium-term return potential. Additionally, the prospect of rising energy demand driven by the expansion of AI and robotics provides meaningful upside optionality that could lead to performance exceeding current consensus expectations. I remain long and firmly Bullish.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_1289725855-750x406.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 20:10:18.854848

The expected increased federal budget deficit will likely lead to higher interest rates, with anticipated new pressures on Connecticut’s state budget.","It’s 870 pages long and significantly reshapes federal policy across many sectors of the U.S. economy.

Here in Connecticut, the economic impact of the One Big Beautiful Act is expected to deliver a mix of industry investment, direct stimulus, and policy changes that will disproportionately impact our state in the years ahead—for better and for worse.

CBIA’s Chris Davis, vice president of Public Policy, Whittlesey’s Brenden Healy, CPA, and CBIA Foundation director, Dustin Nord, dove into the bill’s details during an Aug. 5 webinar.

They highlighted clear benefits for the state’s economy and budget, individuals, and businesses.

They also addressed economic drags, such as higher state borrowing costs that could come from increased national debt, and areas where more clarity is needed from the federal government.

Key Tax Changes, Incentives

Also called the federal budget reconciliation bill, the OBBBA features sweeping changes to the federal tax code.

To help boost spending in Connecticut from 2025 to 2029, the state and local tax deduction cap will increase from $10,000 to $40,000.

This is significant for the state, Nord explained, because only about 10% of personal income tax filers who itemize currently take advantage of the deduction.

With both high state and local taxes and high incomes in Connecticut, the overlap of individuals most likely to take advantage of the SALT cap increase to $40,000 is definitely disproportionate compared to the rest of the nation.

Ultimately, that means more spending, especially in places like southwestern Connecticut.

The downside, Healy added, is that it’s a temporary measure and the benefit is capped at $500,000 for joint filers and $250,000 for single filers.

“One strategy to consider is to accelerate property tax payments or restructure income to maximize the deduction before the SALT cap phases out,” he explained.

Other Temporary Tax Reductions

Middle to lower income individuals can also benefit from no tax on tips or overtime from 2025 to 2028.

In industries that customarily include tips, like restaurants and hospitality venues, the deduction is up to $25,000.

The deduction for overtime pay is up to $12,500 for a single filer and $25,000 for joint filers, and it only applies to excess pay over the regular rate of pay.

With an income phase out, the size of this stimulus is somewhat unknown, Nord said.

The bill also includes temporary deductions up to $10,000 on interest for auto loans, and a $6,000 deduction for taxpayers age 65 or older.

Additional guidance is expected from the Internal Revenue Service, including which new American autos are eligible.

Business Tax Incentives

Connecticut is one of the nation’s largest investors per employee of private investment in industrial spaces.

The OBBBA introduces measures to support businesses, including expanded research and development expensing and the 100% bonus depreciation.

These provisions are especially beneficial for Connecticut’s industrial sector, particularly biotech and advanced manufacturing.

However, the decoupling of state tax law from federal law could limit the impact of these incentives within Connecticut.

Among the business incentives:

For eligible assets placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025, 100% bonus depreciation is now permanent. This gives businesses across multiple sectors more cash to reinvest in equipment, facilities and hiring.

The limit for Section 179 Expensing has increased to $4.5 million.

Thousands of small businesses are expected to take advantage of a permanent 20 Qualified Business Income deduction for owners of pass-through entities and sole proprietorships.

Immediate deductions for domestic research expenses, retroactive for small businesses to 2022.

A retroactive deduction option for small businesses for 2022-2024 expenses.

The qualified Business Income deduction has been expanded and made permanent.

Housing, Industrial Investment

The bill permanently expands the low-income housing tax credit for builders, increasing it 12% per state, creating more opportunities for community investment.

Significant investments are planned for defense manufacturing and maritime workforce development.

The bill includes $250 million for training in defense manufacturing and $450 million in maritime workforce development and supply chain development, which puts Connecticut at a definite advantage, Nord said.

However, guidance for allocating those funds has yet to be published.

State Budget Pressures

While the OBBBA represents significant opportunities for individuals and businesses, it also introduces considerable fiscal pressures and creates potential economic headwinds.

The expected increased federal budget deficit will likely lead to higher interest rates, with anticipated new pressures on Connecticut’s state budget.

The state’s $3 billion annual interest payments could increase, creating challenges for bond-funded capital programs and infrastructure projects.

Other challenges include potential reductions in Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funding.

Cuts to Medicaid of an estimated $13 billion over 10 years could result in 100,000-200,000 fewer people covered by Medicaid, and cuts to SNAP could strain approximately 400,000 low- income participants.

A new excise tax on large endowments, set at 21%, affects institutions like Yale, which rely heavily on endowment funds for research and development.

The tax could also reduce job growth in the biotech sector and impact venture capital investment.

Energy Challenges

Among a number of changes to clean energy funding, the bill eliminates solar and wind incentives, and New England is heavily reliant on expanded renewables for new power generation.

In addition, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, originally due to expire after 2032, now expires Dec. 31, 2025.

Analysts warn of a steep drop in sales once the tax credit disappears.","Electric vehicle sales in the United States are experiencing a sharp spike as consumers rush to take advantage of tax credits worth up to $7,500 before they expire at the end of September.

The looming deadline, set under legislation backed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in July, marks a dramatic policy shift that will effectively eliminate federal incentives for new, used, and leased EVs after September 30 — a full seven years earlier than originally planned under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Under Biden’s plan, the credits would have remained in place until 2032, part of a broader strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which is the single largest contributor to U.S. emissions. The change now leaves a narrow window for buyers to lock in significant savings, pushing the EV market into a frenzy.

Auto analysts say the surge is unprecedented. Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive, predicts the third quarter could set an all-time record for EV sales.

“People are rushing out to buy because they know the incentives are going away,” she said.

In July alone, Americans purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs — the second-highest monthly sales total on record, just behind December’s 136,000. That’s a 26.4% jump from June and almost 20% higher than a year earlier. EVs made up 9.1% of all passenger vehicle sales for the month, the largest share ever recorded.

Used EVs are also seeing record demand, with nearly 36,700 sold in July, according to Cox data. Certain models have emerged as clear winners, including the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai IONIQ 5. The Equinox EV alone sold 8,500 units in July — the highest single-month total for any non-Tesla EV in the U.S. Tesla, still the market leader, has seen its own sales slip for two straight quarters, down 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 9% in Q1.

The appeal of the tax credits is simple economics. A new EV costs an average of $55,689, compared to $48,078 for a new gasoline-powered car. With the federal credit, the price gap all but disappears, bringing an EV’s cost to around $48,189 — near parity with conventional vehicles. Without that subsidy, the affordability advantage vanishes overnight.

Tom Libby, analyst at S&P Global, warns that the end of the credits will “jeopardize” EV price competitiveness, even as state governments and utility companies continue to offer smaller, localized incentives.

Dealers are making the most of the ticking clock. Tesla’s homepage now blares “$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending” alongside “Limited Inventory — Take Delivery Now,” urging customers to finalize purchases before the cutoff. To sweeten the deal, automakers are stacking additional discounts on top of the federal credit. In July, new EV buyers received an average of $9,800 in extra incentives from dealers, worth 17.5% of the average transaction price, the highest level since before EVs began to gain mainstream traction in late 2017.

But the rush may be short-lived. Analysts warn of a steep drop in sales once the tax credit disappears.

“EV sales are likely to collapse in the fourth quarter of 2025,” Streaty said, predicting that the market will have to recalibrate to a new financial reality.

One possible bright spot could be the used EV market, which has already been growing without much help from incentives. Only about one-third of used EVs sold qualified for the $4,000 federal credit even before the policy change, suggesting demand won’t crater as dramatically. With more used EVs entering the market and fewer subsidies for new ones, analysts expect pre-owned models to attract more buyers in the months ahead.

However, the looming expiration of federal incentives has created a paradox of an artificial boom in sales today, shadowed by the threat of a sharp contraction tomorrow.",https://www.tekedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EV-charger-charging.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:46.368049

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

Without that funding, Klein fears that some renewable energy projects in rural and Indigenous communities may never get off the ground.
Federal funding supports between 40 and 50 percent of the institute’s budget, and abrupt changes this spring meant interruptions to long-term climate research projects that require consistent data collection.
Any funding pauses could interrupt the institute’s ongoing monitoring of ocean conditions and the effects of climate change, according to Duffy-Anderson.
GMRI is part of a broader research ecosystem that is studying the impacts of climate change along Maine’s coast.","A University of Maine initiative exploring ways to bring renewable energy to Indigenous and rural communities was gaining momentum this spring when the Trump administration abruptly cancelled its $1 million federal grant.

The Environmental Protection Agency award is one of dozens of federal grants to Maine research institutions that have been cancelled or paused as the Trump administration cracks down on what it sees as wasteful spending. This includes cuts targeting environmental justice initiatives and climate change research.

The UMaine project, which was in its second year of a Science to Achieve Results award, had pulled together more than 100 people from the Wabanaki Nations and rural communities throughout Maine to discuss local renewable energy goals and pathways to reach them.

Over $900,000 of the award was unused at the time of the cancellation, according to project lead and University of Maine professor Sharon Klein.

“We’ve been really smart with our money,” Klein said. “It was definitely a big blow to get the termination because we felt like we were… kind of just hitting our stride.”

The grant was briefly reinstated on June 5 — only to be revoked again four days later.

“There was no explanation for anything,” Klein said. “You just get these emails. So they’re like, ‘It’s terminated,’ ‘Nope, it’s back,’ ‘Nope, it’s terminated again.’”

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment by publication.

Without that funding, Klein fears that some renewable energy projects in rural and Indigenous communities may never get off the ground. Local opposition to solar and wind projects is common, and the development process is burdensome. She’s still meeting with community members and advising them on grant applications, but she’s spread thin.

“We risk communities being unprepared for the disasters that are coming for them with climate change, because they haven’t had the capacity to… prepare,” Klein said.

While much of the initiative’s efforts have been curtailed by the grant cancellation, one of the positions it funded has been salvaged by a grant from the Maine state government: the coordinator for climate and energy resilience projects with the Wabanaki Nations.

The coordinator, Kelsey Flores, continues to support the first update to the Penobscot Nation’s strategic energy plan in 20 years, training of new technicians to install energy-efficient appliances, and recently secured $15,000 for emergency preparedness kits for households.

Though the swift rescission of the STAR grant caused the cancellation of emerging energy projects, Flores says there’s still hope to bring electric heat pumps, solar and other projects to Wabanaki communities.

The grant cancellation “is affecting almost every initiative that we have,” Flores said, “and we really are trying to restructure things so that we can still move forward.”

The University of Maine isn’t the only research institution that has seen cuts to federally funded climate change initiatives.

Down the coast in Portland, the nonprofit Gulf of Maine Research Institute has had $4 million in federal awards paused or terminated since February, according to the organization’s chief scientific officer Janet Duffy-Anderson.

Federal funding supports between 40 and 50 percent of the institute’s budget, and abrupt changes this spring meant interruptions to long-term climate research projects that require consistent data collection.

One of the early casualties involved the institute’s “energy solutions” program, said Dave Reidmiller, the nonprofit’s chief impact officer. That included an initiative to understand concerns lobster and groundfish fishermen might have with the development of offshore wind projects.

The program received two federal awards — one from the EPA, another from the Department of Energy. Both awards were frozen after Trump took office, halting GMRI’s engagement work with the fishing industry. The DOE grant was restored months later, but the EPA grant was terminated.

“They were really intended to elevate the interests and concerns of the fishing industry in the offshore wind development process,” said Reidmiller. “A core piece of that was making sure that the best available science and technical information was in their hands to weigh in in an informed manner with the federal decision makers.”

In addition to the stop-and-go pauses and termination of existing awards, research institutions across the country have been grappling with a longer review process that federal agencies are now instituting before releasing funds.

This includes funding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where awards over $100,000 have to be reviewed and approved by the head of the U.S. Commerce Department, Axios reported in April.

Any funding pauses could interrupt the institute’s ongoing monitoring of ocean conditions and the effects of climate change, according to Duffy-Anderson. Such interruptions cause mariners to lose access to buoy data that informs how they navigate the ocean, and could diminish the accuracy of GMRI’s long-term forecasts and projections.

“Not only are your weather forecasts going to be probably less skillful and less accurate, but the model forecast for the longer term (models) are going to be inhibited as well,” said Reidmiller. “So it’s a real disservice to anybody who cares about the weather.”

Researchers are concerned about what these changes and the Trump administration’s proposed budget cuts suggest for federal funding opportunities going forward, including at other nonprofit research outfits like the Downeast Institute.

“NOAA in general funds so many important programs across the nation and we hope that funding will continue to flow,” said Kyle Pepperman, associate director of the Downeast Institute. “We are worried but we are also very diversified so we should be able to weather this storm.”

Duffy-Anderson with GMRI was blunt about the impacts reduced funding opportunities would have on her institution and beyond. GMRI is part of a broader research ecosystem that is studying the impacts of climate change along Maine’s coast.

“If we don’t have opportunities for continued research,” Duffy-Anderson said, “it really slows that information exchange and is going to have a significant impact in the future.”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gulf-of-Maine-Research-Center.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 13:04:33.823090

In one of them, protecting bald eagles suddenly emerged as a Trump administration priority.","Bald eagles must be protected to the fullest extent of the law from dangerous wind turbines, President Trump’s interior secretary declared this week.

But four months ago, President Trump called for gutting the very law that applies, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, calling it a burden on oil and gas producers.

Trump administration officials insisted there is no conflict between the two positions and said the president is consistently enforcing laws for all forms of energy development.

“President Trump has taken vast measures to unleash American energy by rolling back regulatory burdens while continuing to enforce the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to protect the Bald Eagle species — a historic symbol of American greatness,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement.

Conservationists said the Trump administration’s embrace of America’s iconic bird is just a pretext for attacking the wind industry, which the president has publicly seethed about ever since he lost a legal battle to stop a wind farm from being built in view of one of his Scottish golf courses.

It also underscores the double standard the Trump administration has for months employed around energy policy. Mr. Trump has declared that the United States faces an energy “emergency” but has taken dozens of steps to throttle the development of wind and solar power. And in easing the way for coal, oil and gas development, the Trump administration has proposed several measures that would weaken protections for eagles and other migratory birds.

“All of the concern for eagles is concentrated solely on wind right now,” said Sarah Krakoff, a professor of environmental law at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Wind energy is responsible for less than 0.01 percent of human-caused bird fatalities, according to the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy lobbying group. Federal data shows wind turbines cause significantly fewer bird deaths than buildings, cats or oil pits. The Audubon Society says that climate change poses a bigger threat to birds than wind power.

When it comes to bald eagles, the leading cause of death varies by region, but power line collisions and lead poisoning are consistently cited as major threats. In Michigan, avian influenza has led to the deaths of at least 18 eagles this year, according to the state’s Department of Natural Resources.

The bald eagle, with its white head and yellow beak, appears on the Great Seal of the United States, flags, currency and military insignia but was only officially designated the national bird in 2024.

It is protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940. The law prohibits anyone from killing, wounding or “taking” eagles (including their feathers, nests or eggs) unless granted a permit by the interior secretary. Violations can result in fines, criminal penalties or even prison time.

The law, along with the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, has been credited with bringing the bald eagle back from the brink of extinction in addition to the banning of the insecticide DDT in 1972.

President Trump has sought to weaken all three laws.

In March the administration announced it would no longer penalize companies for accidentally killing birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and blocked a regulation proposed during the Biden administration that would have enshrined additional protections for birds.

The move was viewed as a major victory for oil and gas companies, which argued the industry was unfairly prosecuted for accidental bird deaths.

The administration also proposed to weaken the Endangered Species Act by excluding the destruction of habitat from the definition of what it means to harm imperiled plants and animals. The oil industry said that would speed up permits and make it easier to drill in the United States.

And in April, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that directed agencies to sunset regulations that stem from the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, along with other federal laws. “By rescinding outdated regulations that serve as a drag on progress, we can stimulate innovation and deliver prosperity to everyday Americans,” the order said.

In recent weeks the administration has issued a barrage of rules aimed at blocking wind and solar production.

In one of them, protecting bald eagles suddenly emerged as a Trump administration priority.

Mr. Burgum directed the Fish and Wildlife Service to review of a regulation that currently allows wind energy companies to obtain a permit to incidentally “take” or harm a certain number of eagles during their operations, provided they take steps to minimize harm.

Mr. Burgum also called on the agency to review violations that have occurred under the law, and “where appropriate,” refer them to the Department of Justice, raising the possibility that wind operators could be criminally prosecuted for eagle deaths.

William Bowerman, a professor of wildlife ecology and toxicology at the University of Maryland, said wind turbines “can have a detrimental effect” on bald and golden eagles but not enough to threaten the overall population.

Some called the new bald eagle policy cynical.

“If they cared about eagles they would create regulatory protections for them,” said Tracy Stone-Manning, president of The Wilderness Society who led the Bureau of Land Management under the Biden administration.

Ms. Krakoff, the law professor, said she believes the Trump administration is likely to lose legal challenges in its effort to crack down on wind, given that many of the same rules have been loosened for oil and gas. “That will be hard to defend as anything other than arbitrary,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/08/multimedia/00cli-eagles-wind-wplq/00cli-eagles-wind-wplq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:11.501657

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is facing growing criticism from scientists who say their “worst fears” were realized when Wright revealed that the Trump administration would “update” the US’s premier climate crisis reports.

Wright, a former oil and gas executive, told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins earlier this week that the administration was reviewing national climate assessment reports published by past governments.

Produced by scientists and peer-reviewed, there have been five national climate assessment (NCA) reports since 2000 and they are considered the gold standard report of global heating and its impacts on human health, agriculture, water supplies and air pollution.

“We’re reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those reports,” said Wright, who is one of the main supporters of the administration’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are the primary cause of the climate crisis.

Wright was speaking days after his agency, the Department of Energy, produced a report claiming concern over the climate crisis was overblown. That energy department report was slammed by scientists for being a “farce” full of misinformation.

Speaking to CNN about the national climate assessment reports, Wright claimed they “weren’t fair in broad-based assessments of climate change.” He added: “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said.

In recent weeks the Trump administration deleted the website that hosted the periodic, legally mandated, national climate assessments. (The most recent report can be read in full on the Guardian website.)

Asked about Wright’s comments on the national climate assessment reports, respected climate scientist Michael Mann said in an emailed comment to the Guardian: “This is exactly what Joseph Stalin did.”

In a statement on Thursday, Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and one of the authors of the sixth NCA report due in 2028 that the administration dismissed earlier this year, said she was dismayed by Wright’s comments: “Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears—that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it.”

“The process for developing the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports is rigorous, ” she added, “with federal agencies and hundreds of scientists constructing this solid scientific foundation that decision makers, businesses and the public rely on to stay safe in a world made more perilous each day by climate change.”

The acquisition covers Northvolt Ett and Ett Expansion in Skellefteå, Northvolt Labs in Västerås, and Northvolt Drei in Heide, Germany. Lyten will also take over the company’s patents and proprietary technology. The transaction follows Lyten’s earlier purchases of other Northvolt assets, including its California Cuberg plant, the Dwa battery energy storage system (BESS) manufacturing site in Poland and Northvolt’s BESS product and IP portfolio.

Northvolt filed for bankruptcy in March 2025, ceasing production in June after failing to secure a buyer in time. The company had accumulated around US$8 billion in debt, with major unsecured creditors including Goldman Sachs and Volkswagen, whose brands Scania, Porsche and Audi had been Northvolt customers. Bankruptcy trustee Mikael Kubu said many creditors would face significant losses.

Matthias Arleth, Northvolt’s former Chief Operations Officer, told Reuters the company had been producing up to 30,000 high-quality battery cells per week at the Skellefteå plant before operations halted. “The quality of the cells was in the 90% yield range,” Arleth said, adding that this output had been a decisive factor in the sale.

“Lyten’s acquisition of the Northvolt assets brings the facilities and Swedish talent to accelerate this mission by years, just at the moment when demand for Lyten lithium-sulfur batteries is growing to meet energy independence, national security, and AI data center needs,” says Dan Cook, CEO, Lyten.

Lyten plans to restart operations in Skellefteå and Västerås immediately after the deal closes. The company is also working with the German government to advance plans for a 15 GWh battery manufacturing facility in Heide and is pursuing the acquisition of Northvolt Six in Quebec, Canada, which is constructing a 15 GWh facility in its first phase.

So far it has spent about $200,000 of the grant, according to energy office spokesperson Afton Vigue.

In a Thursday letter to the state, the Environmental Protection Agency said the recent Republican tax law, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, revoked the $7 billion ""Solar for All"" national grant program.

""Thus, any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,"" the agency said.

But supporters of the national program claim it is being shut down illegally and will hurt Americans struggling with high electric bills.

""Canceling the program deprives Maine of access to affordable solar, energy storage, and the skilled electricians, installers, and construction workers needed to meet our energy and economic needs now and in the future,"" said Dan Burgess, director of the Maine Governor's Energy Office.

""We remain committed to this program and will review all options to preserve it,"" Burgess added.

The office is reviewing the EPA notice and determining next steps in consultation with the Maine Office of Attorney General, the energy office said.

Maine received its Solar for All award last April. So far it has spent about $200,000 of the grant, according to energy office spokesperson Afton Vigue.

The EPA approved the office's Solar for All plan just last month. It intended to introduce the program in early 2026.

The funding was projected to help about 20,000 low income people in Maine lower electric bills through incentives for rooftop solar panels and cooperative solar arrays, according to the office.

It also included funding to train 700 Maine residents in electrical work, construction and other trades, Viggue said.

The Solar for All program was established in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA made awards to 60 states and tribes through the program.

In a statement, Vermont's Independent Senator Bernie Sanders said he introduced Solar for All to help working families save money.

The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.

The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.

The House bill effectively renders moot many of the law’s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.

“The House’s plan coupled with the administration’s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.

The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president’s desk.

WHAT HAS BEEN CANCELED

Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner’s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.

Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies’ plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.

Of the projects canceled this year, most — more than $12 billion worth — came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.

Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.

“If all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I’m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,” said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.

A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county’s position as a global energy leader.

THE U.S. AND THE GLOBAL STAGE

The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden’s environmental and climate-related policy — what he calls the Democrats’ “green new scam” — withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led “American energy dominance” agenda.

Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent “carbon leakage,” or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.

In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi’s energy arm building out transmission and electrification operations in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.

Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed in May, according to E2’s tally.",http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060425_CleanEnergyCanceled_01_Zstock.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 06:59:37.873956

In the U.S., a slower EV ramp means these businesses will retain a customer base for longer, delaying the urgency to adapt.
While this may be seen as a reprieve for some, it also risks leaving service networks less prepared for the eventual acceleration in EV adoption.
In Europe, phased bans on new ICE sales, combined with dense charging networks and purchase incentives, are compressing the adoption timeline.
Costs will continue to come down, technology will improve, and many states will keep pushing forward regardless of federal policy.","In July 2025, the Trump administration moved to slow the pace of electric vehicle adoption in the United States through a package of policy reversals and trade measures. Federal purchase incentives for new and used EVs will end on September 30, the national charging infrastructure program has been shut down, and California’s authority to enforce its zero-emission vehicle mandate has been rescinded. The administration has also imposed steep tariffs on imported EVs and auto parts, while opening investigations that could extend similar duties to critical battery minerals and key EV components. These steps land at a moment when U.S. EV sales are edging toward a tipping point, raising questions about whether policy headwinds can stall a market already shaped by global momentum and shifting consumer economics.

These actions have immediate and long-term implications. They raise prices, reduce consumer incentives, and send mixed signals to automakers that had been ramping up production in expectation of stricter emissions standards. The net effect is a slowdown in the S-curve of EV adoption, with the United States now facing a delay in reaching key tipping points in the transition away from internal combustion.

This piece is part of an intermittent series of articles on the coming tipping points in EV adoption indicated by the complementary systems change observations of diffusion of innovations, logistic growth or the s-curve, and complex adaptive systems, introduced in the first article. The second dealt with changes when 5%–15% penetrations of EVs were reached, something already present in some markets. The third dealt with the critical 15%–40% range, when change is accelerating and the internal combustion services industry starts feeling the impacts. The fourth dealt with the next big transition, the 40%–80% range, when internal combustion service firms start shuttering en masse, requiring significant governmental assistance transitioning work forces. The fifth article explored where Europe is and where it will be, with the conclusion being that it will be well into the deep transformation away from internal combustion vehicles by 2035. After this article on the United States, I’ll likely assess China and India before winding up the series.

Under the new policy environment in the United States, the path from 5% to 15% BEV share of new vehicle sales will likely extend into the late 2020s, a slower climb than the three to four years seen in markets with supportive policies. Automakers may prioritize profitable gasoline and diesel trucks and SUVs in the absence of aggressive fuel economy rules. Without federal purchase incentives, the affordability gap between EVs and comparable ICE models widens, especially with tariffs adding thousands of dollars to the sticker price of many imported EVs and components. This slows consumer adoption, particularly among buyers in middle and lower income brackets who are more price sensitive. Charging infrastructure growth will also be affected, as the freeze on federal funding removes a key support for expanding public charging in areas where private investment is not yet viable.

If this policy stance persists beyond 2028 under continued MAGA-aligned leadership, the result will be a drawn-out progression toward the 40% tipping point where EVs enter the majority of new sales. That milestone, which could have been reached in the early 2030s, would likely slip into the mid-2030s. The gap will be especially visible when comparing the U.S. to Europe and China, where aggressive mandates, incentives, and infrastructure buildouts are keeping adoption on a steeper curve. The U.S. would remain a large market, but increasingly out of sync with global EV trends.

If there is a political shift in 2028 and federal support is restored, the adoption curve could bend back toward the faster trajectory. Restoring tax credits, reimposing strong emissions standards, and resuming charging network funding could see the U.S. move from 15% to 40% EV sales share in four to six years, catching up with the global leaders by the early 2030s. Automakers would still have the product pipelines and supply chain improvements developed for other markets, making a rapid acceleration feasible once the policy environment turns favorable again. However, the years lost to slower growth cannot be recovered, and the market would still be behind where it could have been without the interruption.

An often-overlooked dimension of this slowdown is its impact on the secondary ICE service sector. In countries with faster EV adoption, businesses focused on ICE servicing — muffler shops, oil change franchises, and independent engine repair garages — have already begun to see demand fall, leading to closures or shifts toward EV-related work. Norway’s rapid transition forced many such businesses to retrain or exit. In much of Europe, urban areas are experiencing the same pattern.

In the U.S., a slower EV ramp means these businesses will retain a customer base for longer, delaying the urgency to adapt. While this may be seen as a reprieve for some, it also risks leaving service networks less prepared for the eventual acceleration in EV adoption. The skills, equipment, and investment needed to serve an EV-dominated fleet will still be necessary, and delaying the shift can make the eventual transition more disruptive.

With federal policy turning against electric vehicles and tariffs making imported EVs more expensive, U.S. automakers are likely to double down on selling profitable gasoline and diesel trucks and SUVs into the domestic market. This will keep their ICE production volumes high at home, but it will also mean falling further behind competitors in Europe, China, and other regions where EV adoption is accelerating and automakers are scaling electric platforms aggressively.

By focusing resources on defending domestic ICE sales rather than competing for global EV market share, U.S. manufacturers will further cede leadership in battery technology, supply chain integration, and high-volume electric production to foreign rivals. Over time, this will make it harder for them to sell competitively priced and technologically advanced EVs abroad, reducing export opportunities and narrowing their relevance in the international automotive industry. This in turn will have more domestic impacts.

Comparing the U.S. to other countries underscores how policy and market signals influence the pace of change in both vehicle sales and secondary services. In China, where national policy strongly supports EVs, automakers, suppliers, and service networks are aligning quickly with the electric future. In Europe, phased bans on new ICE sales, combined with dense charging networks and purchase incentives, are compressing the adoption timeline. The secondary service sector there is adapting faster, with growing numbers of EV-specialized repair facilities and declining numbers of ICE-focused shops. In the U.S., the current policy direction risks prolonging reliance on ICE vehicles and the services that support them, even as the rest of the world moves more quickly toward electric mobility.

The EV transition in the United States is still inevitable over the long term. Costs will continue to come down, technology will improve, and many states will keep pushing forward regardless of federal policy. But the timeline to reach critical tipping points is now more dependent on the political cycle. A supportive federal stance after 2028 could reignite momentum and close the gap with other major markets.

Continued resistance could leave the U.S. trailing for much of the next decade, with the impacts felt not only in new vehicle sales but across the entire automotive ecosystem, from manufacturing to fueling to repair and maintenance. The shape of the adoption curve is still being decided, and with it the country’s place in the global shift to electric transportation.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-8-2025-03_00_54-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-08-09 07:00:12.390346

The funding will support the construction of 18 DC fast charger sites and 18 Level 2 charging stations, as announced by the organization.

The financial support originates from Volkswagen mitigation funds, according to Carl Lisek, executive director of Drive Clean Indiana. The DC fast chargers will be strategically placed along Indiana’s Alternative Fuel Corridors, providing round-the-clock access at locations such as travel centers, dining areas, and retail hubs along major highways. These corridors align with the federal National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program’s efforts to bolster EV charging at key transit points.

“Indiana has already invested more than $13 billion into EV and battery manufacturing facilities, and these new charging sites will help support the next wave of Hoosier EV drivers,” said Ryan Lisek, program director at Drive Clean Indiana, during a briefing in Indianapolis.

The Level 2 chargers will be installed in both urban and rural settings, targeting areas where vehicles are parked for longer periods, such as community centers and commercial zones. These sites, chosen for their visibility, are backed by a mix of private and public investments, though contracts with awardees are still in progress.

Previously, the Indiana Department of Transportation identified 39 sites for NEVI-funded DC fast chargers, originally planned for completion this year. After federal NEVI funding was discontinued, several sites, including six from Pilot, were integrated into GOEVIN’s current initiative, with Pilot contributing two additional locations.

Earlier this year, GOEVIN launched its “Closing the Gap Tour,” visiting eight Indiana cities—Evansville, Clarksville, Indianapolis, Muncie, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Lafayette, and Hammond. The tour showcased the state’s existing EV infrastructure, highlighted successful local electric fleets, and encouraged businesses and municipalities to address charging network gaps.

Construction of the new chargers is set to begin soon, with all 36 projects expected to be completed by the end of 2026. This effort underscores Indiana’s commitment to supporting the rising demand for electric vehicles and promoting sustainable transportation solutions statewide.",,N,,2025-08-09 20:12:30.717719

“On average, the charger has delivered less than 8% of that amount, about 22 miles per day.” In a Thursday interview with The Center Square, Myers elaborated on the data.
So, it’s incredibly wasteful.” Project supporters in Tumwater indicated they would partner with a company to collect data on usage for the solar EV charger.
it’s just raw data.” Myers argues that Washington’s EV charger grants encourage waste by distorting the costs and benefits.
“We’ve seen this in lots of places.” Tumwater Communications Manager Jason Wettstein responded to a request for comment about Myers’ criticism.","(The Center Square) – Ten months after Tumwater, Wash., installed a solar-powered electric vehicle charger in a city park, new data obtained by the Washington Policy Center think tank indicates the EV charger has not lived up to promises made by city officials.

As reported by The Center Square last summer, city officials touted the off-grid nature of the pilot program’s charger, which relies on solar power and battery backup to avoid straining the grid. The charging station in Pioneer Park is ADA accessible and includes a 110-volt outlet for charging electric wheelchairs and bikes. It is also free to use by the public.

“This will be especially helpful in areas where we don’t have existing electrical capacity, or we don’t want to trench through things like athletic fields,” Alyssa Jones Wood, the city’s sustainability manager, said at the time. “This is a pilot, so it has the opportunity to scale up if successful.”

The Washington State Department of Commerce awarded Tumwater a $87,052 grant to install the charger and for maintenance. The city matched that grant with $12,742 from its General Fund allocation for Sustainability Initiatives.

“When the system was installed, it was claimed it could provide 300 miles per day,” Todd Myers, WPC’s vice president for research, wrote in a Thursday blog. “On average, the charger has delivered less than 8% of that amount, about 22 miles per day.”

In a Thursday interview with The Center Square, Myers elaborated on the data.

“After 10 months in service, the system has delivered 1,700 kilowatt-hours of electricity to EVs, the equivalent of 6,800 miles worth of charge for a Tesla Model 3, in all that time,” he said.

Myers noted he was extremely skeptical from the beginning that the project could generate anywhere near what the city projected.

“Tumwater, Wash., is not Phoenix, Ariz. It is literally the worst place in America for solar power … and that’s just because it’s cloudy most of the time,” he observed.

He noted the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has a solar radiation map for all parts of the country. Outside of Alaska, Western Washington fares the worst in terms of sunshine received.

“So, they say it is still reducing CO2 emissions. It has delivered 1.7 megawatt hours of electricity. That’s about 1,400 pounds of CO2. That is nothing,” Myers explained. “On current prices, that’s worth about $37. So, you spent $85,000 to save $37 in the first 10 months.”

He noted that even stretching out the benefit over time does not translate into a worthwhile investment.

“Let’s say this lasts for 20 years,” Myers said. “It won’t, but let’s say it lasts for 20 years. That’s less than $1,000 of value that you spent $85,000 extra today for. So, it’s incredibly wasteful.”

Project supporters in Tumwater indicated they would partner with a company to collect data on usage for the solar EV charger.

“When I reached out to Tumwater to ask them, ‘Can you send me the data?’ what they said was that the company that was providing more granular detail on the data went out of business last year,” Myers told The Center Square. “So, all they have are just sort of the raw data from the system that they can download. They don’t have type, and they don’t have who’s using it …. it’s just raw data.”

Myers argues that Washington’s EV charger grants encourage waste by distorting the costs and benefits.

“This is a common problem, which is that cities like to say, ‘Look, we’re on the cutting edge. We’re leaders in this.’ And then they go out and they buy technology and then the technology either fails, or the company goes out of business,” he said. “We’ve seen this in lots of places.”

Tumwater Communications Manager Jason Wettstein responded to a request for comment about Myers’ criticism.

“People across the country are working to find ways to reduce harmful air pollution that is warming our planet and contributing to natural disasters, and learning through pilot projects like this contributes to that important objective,” Wettstein emailed The Center Square.

“A goal of this pilot project was to increase the amount of publicly available EV charging, and this seemed like a cost-effective way to do that. One other aspect that is harder to monetize is the fact that Pioneer Park floods. The Beam unit, unlike other traditional chargers, is flood-proof up to 9.5 feet.”

Myers noted that city and state officials using taxpayer money for environmental projects that don’t pan out provides skeptics with more ammunition.

“This has sort of become a metaphor for Washington state’s climate policy, where we make all these big promises. We do press releases. We brag about what a leader we are. And then a year later, we find that none of those promises have been met, and a lot of money has been wasted for no environmental benefit,” Myers said. “We know how to do things for the environment where we can deliver on the promises and results. Politicians just choose not to, and they need to be held accountable for it.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/02/90246bf0-0d7d-41ca-9c34-377e2eec035e/67ddd1285ccc1.image.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:06:19.478258

Radiant in Deal to Deliver Its Microreactor to USAF

Radiant Nuclear, a startup based in California, announced this week that it signed an agreement to deliver the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) unit of its microreactor to a U.S. Air Force military based in 2028. The value of the contract and the location of the USAF base to receive the microreactor were not disclosed in press materials.

Radiant has received funding awards from the US Department of Defense to evaluate the integration of microreactors at the Hill Air Force Base. The military installation located just off I-25, is 30 miles north of Salt Lake City UT, and 182 miles south of Idaho Falls, ID.

The deal is a first for what is intended to be a “mass-manufactured” microreactor. The customer for the plant is the Defense Innovation Unit, Department of the Air Force. The DIU describes its role as the only DoD organization focused on accelerating the adoption of commercial and dual-use technology to solve operational challenges at speed and scale.

The contract comes soon after the Department of Energy selected Radiant’s Kaleidos reactor to be scheduled to test next year at Idaho National Laboratory’s Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) facility. This will be the first new design of a U.S. reactor to be tested at DOME in almost 50 years.

“We’re proud to be the first agreement designed to deliver mass-manufactured nuclear microreactors for a U.S. military base,” said Radiant CEO and Founder Doug Bernauer.

“In 36 months, Kaleidos reactors will arrive via truck and within 48 hours plug in, power on, and provide resilient, cyber-secure power to our nation’s Air Force for years without refueling. The mandate of the USAF innovation office is to strengthen our national security by accelerating the adoption of dual-use technology for the military. “

Radiant’s nuclear progress has included hiring former US DOE Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Rita Baranwal in June. Her distinguished technical career includes executive roles at the INL and Westinghouse prior to her government service.

About the Radiant Nuclear Reactor

Radiant’s Kaleidos design is a transportable micro-reactor designed to generate 3MWth and approximately 1MWe. The Kaleidos micro-reactor is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) using TRISO fuel, helium gas coolant, and prismatic graphite blocks. Each micro-reactor will be fully contained in a single shipping container.

The reactor is being designed to weigh 70 tons (140,000 pounds) and to fit in an 11 x 11 x 35 container. Radiant says the reactor can set up to be producing power within 48 hours of delviery at a customer site. The reactor has a five-year fuel cycle and a 20-year service life. The refueling cycle is carried out at a remote maintenace facility with the reactor returned to service with fresh fuel.

Radiant Fuel Plans

Radiant plans to use HALEU for its Kaleidos SMR. In 2022, Radiant launched a Request for Proposals for fuel fabricators to produce TRISO fuel, and in 2023 the company entered into an agreement with Centrus Energy to work towards a future supply of HALEU for up to 20 Kaleidos microreactors. In 2023, Radiant also received funding from the US DOE to support activities related to qualification modelling for TRISO fuel.

One Size Does Not Fit All

A standard shipping container used globally in international commerce is 40 feet long, 8’6″ high, 8.0′ wide. A so-called ‘hifgh cube’ would be 9’6″ in height. It weighs about 8,600 pounds empty with a cargo capacity of 58,800 pounds. or about 30 tons. The Radiant reactor shipment dimensions are three feet higher and three feet wider and weighs 40 tons more than the capacity of a standard truck shipping container.

These numbers could present challenges for the location of the Radiant Nuclear factory and maintenance facilities near Casper, WY. Currently, local roads and bridges in Casper, WY, have a weight limit of 72,000 pounds for a five axle truck or half of the weight of a Radiant reactor shipment which is 70 tons (140,000 pounds).

For travel on I-25, which serves Casper, WY, with connections to Cheyenne, WY, and Denver, CO, the U.S. Department of Transportation federal highway weight limit is 80,000 pounds for a 5-axle truck which is 30 tons less than the weight of the Radiant microreactor.

Casper, WY, is served by the BSNF, a Class 1 railroad and is only one of seven railroad companies in the US with this level of service. The railroad might be a an option for transporting the radiant reactor to and from the Wyoming facility.

A BSNF flatbed railcar can carry up to 233,000 pounds or 116 tons which is 46 tons more than the weight of the Radiant shipment. However, the width limit for a shipment on a BNSF flatbed rail car, which has to fit through mountain tunnels and bridges, is 10’6″ which is an unforgiving 4 inches too short for the Radiant reactor. BSNF ships large packages all the time such as Boeing jet airliner fuelages. A dialog with the railroad might yield useful results.

Given the weight and size limits of available rail transportation infrastructure, Radiant’s potential design options may be to either change the configuration of a single load to fit within rail car limits or ship the reactor in rail car in compliant size pieces to be assembled on site or disassembled to be returned to the Wyoming site for refueling and maintenance.

Radiant Funding

Radiant raised $60 million in venture funding including $40 million in Series B fundraising in April 2023 and $100 million in Series C fundraising in November 2024, which it plans to use to test the Kaleidos microreactor at the DOME facility and to support siting for a factory that would eventually produce up to 50 microreactors per year.

Radiant also received two awards from the NRIC program: up to $1.5 million for front-end engineering and experiment design (FEEED) in 2023; and up to $5 million for detailed engineering and experiment planning (DEEP) in 2024.

Radiant Chosen for Testing at INL DOME Facility

The U.S. Department of Energy this week made conditional selections for Radiant and Westinghouse to perform the first tests in the Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) facility at Idaho National Laboratory. The DOME experiments will be the first of their kind in the world and will fast-track the deployment of American microreactor technologies. The first fueled reactor experiment will start as early as spring 2026.

“Microreactors will play a big role in expanding the use of nuclear power in the United States,” said Mike Goff, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy.

DOME will be the first microreactor test bed in the world and leverages existing infrastructure at Idaho National Laboratory to safely house and test fueled reactor experiments that produce up to 20 MW of thermal energy. Data collected from the experiments will be used to commercialize each reactor technology.

Radiant will test the Kaleidos Development Unit to advance the company’s commercial 1.2 MWe high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) design as a potential replacement for diesel generators. Kaleidos is designed to operate for five years before refueling and could provide reliable backup power to large facilities like military bases and hospitals.

Westinghouse to Test eVinci Microreactor at DOME

DOE selected Westinghouse to test the eVinci Nuclear Test Reactor to inform the development of its commercial transportable microreactor that uses advanced heat pipe technology to passively cool the reactor. The eVinci reactor is designed to produce 5 MWe of electricity on sites as small as two acres of land and could be used to power various applications from remote communities to mining operations or data centers.

Scope of the DOME Test Work for Microreactors

The two reactor developers were competitively selected in 2023 to perform initial activities for potential testing in DOME. Both companies are currently working through the multi-phase DOE authorization process to support the design, fabrication, construction, and testing of each fueled reactor experiment.

The Department estimates each DOME reactor experiment will operate up to six months. The testing campaigns are self-funded by the applicants with the sequencing of experiments based on several criteria, including technology readiness, fuel availability, and a regulatory approval plan. Both companies are expected to meet certain milestones throughout the process to maintain their allotted time in DOME and to ensure efficient use of the test bed.

The DOME test bed is currently under construction and on track to receive its first experiment in early 2026. The facility is operated by DOE’s National Reactor Innovation Center, which enables access to the world-class capabilities across the Department’s national laboratories to accelerate the development of advanced reactor technologies.

DOE recently closed its first round of applications for scheduling experiments in DOME. The next call for applications is anticipated to be in the summer of 2026.

Radiant to Manufacture Its Microreactor in Wyoming

(Cowboy State Daily) Microreactor manufacturer Radiant has signed a deal to mass-produce portable microreactors to power U.S. Air Force bases and promote energy independence. The company wants to make them in the tiny town of Bar Nunn, WY, located 10 miles north of Casper. WY, in Natrona County, WY. (map)

Radiant hopes the military contract adds momentum to its efforts to establish a manufacturing presence in Wyoming.

Radiant executives told a town meeting earlier this year that Wyoming’s workforce, strong career and technical education programs and spot as the nation’s largest uranium producer were factors in choosing Bar Nunn. The plan, which supporters see as a “generational opportunity,” promises to bring high-paying jobs, help Wyoming’s economy rely less on fossil fuels and keep skilled young people from moving away. The project also fits with federal goals to speed up nuclear reactor development.

The proposed facility would span approximately 350,000 square feet and create an estimated 75 jobs initially, with the potential to grow to 250 jobs as production scales up.

Factory operations will include;

New reactors assembled, fueled, and tested, and shipped to customers.

Reactors shipped back to factory for maintenance and refueling. Five year cycle.

Spent fuel securely stored above ground in concrete casks pending a permanent federal government solution.

Conceptual Image of a Radiant Maintenance Facility

Radiant has proposed that when its microreactors need refueling, the units, with the spent fuel, will be shipped back to its manufacturing facility. That’s raised concerns in Natrona County, and it has an interim committee with the Wyoming Legislature considering legislation to allow the storage of nuclear waste. (Infographic Radiant presentation to the Wyoming Legislature )

The Legislature’s Joint Minerals, Business & Economic Development Committee plans to meet again to discuss proposed legislation. It tabled a draft bill during a hearing July 30th held in Casper, and the committee has not yet scheduled a follow up meeting.

The draft authorizes, “the siting of temporary high-level radioactive waste storage facilities and installations within this state.”

The Cowboy State Daily newspaper reports that the powerful Wyoming Freedom Caucus, now the majority in the state legislature, has publicly stated an anti-nuclear waste position. This opposition could make it more difficult for Radiant supporters in the legislature to change the law.

The Radiant site isn’t the only nuclear reactor planned to be built in Wyoming, TerraPower has broken ground for non-nuclear site preparation in Kemmerer, WY, a coal town located in the far southwestern corner of the state. There TerraPower plans to build a 345 MWe sodium cooled advanced reactor to replace a coal fired power plant.

It seems likely that with the TerraPower project underway and Radiant poised to launch its manufacturing center in Wyoming that the state legislature will have to come to grips with the facts about safety related to these reactors and dismiss knee-jerk politics by a faction more interested in political influence than in economic and energy related progress. The state has long been a center of uranium mining and is no newcomer to the world of nuclear fuel and it uses.

General Matter Gets DOE Lease at Paducah for Uranium Enrichment

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the signing of a lease with General Matter for the reuse of a 100-acre parcel of federal land at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant for a new private-sector domestic uranium enrichment facility.

General Matter is one of four companies DOE selected in October 2024 to provide enrichment services for the establishment of a U.S. supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium. Building domestic supply chains is critical to the reshoring and domestic expansion of energy for advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence data centers.

The lease provides General Matter with a minimum of 7,600 cylinders of existing uranium hexafluoride (UF6) to supply fuel for future re-enrichment operations. Reprocessing of uranium hexafluoride saves the American taxpayer about $800 million in avoided disposal costs.

The cylinders, some of which have been in storage for decades, have been a disposal headache for DOE. Given the demand for enriched uranium at HALEU levels, re-enriching the tails is a commercial way out of a dead end for the agency.

Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives June 13, 2011 GAO-11-752T.

Statement of Gene Aloise, Director Natural Resources and Environment

General Matter will benefit from a consistent supply of U.S.-origin uranium hexafluoride feed suitable for re-enrichment. Re-enrichment of uranium tails can take place using one of two processes – gas centrifuge or laser based enrichment.

The gaseous diffusion process is consider to be too expensive due to its enormous use of electricity compared to other methods. During the Manhattan Project in the 1940s it took the resources of TVA to provide the plant with enough power to run its operations. The Paduicah plant ceased operations in 2013.

According to the World Nuclear Association, the gaseous diffusion process consumes about 2500 kWh (9000 MJ) per SWU, while modern gas centrifuge plants require only about 50 kWh (180 MJ) per SWU. Enrichment accounts for almost half of the cost of nuclear fuel and about 5% of the total cost of the electricity generated. At its end of life USEC reported the plant consumed a peak electrical demand of 3,040 megawatts of power.

The American Nuclear Society Newswire notes that from 1952 to 2013, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant enriched uranium was the last government-owned uranium enrichment facility operating in the United States. The plant produced LEU originally as feedstock for nuclear weapons materials and later for commercial nuclear power plants.

The DOE has been actively cleaning up the Paducah site since 1988 with the intention of making it available for reuse for industrial redevelopment. Subject to licensing by the NRC, General Matter’s construction is expected to begin in 2026 with uranium enrichment operations planned to begin by the end of the decade.

World Nuclear News reported General Matter was one of four companies selected in October 2024 by the US Department of Energy to provide enrichment services to help establish a US supply of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU).

According to information available at the time, the company had been registered in California earlier in the year, with Scott Nolan named as its CEO. Nolan, a former SpaceX employee, is a partner at venture capital firm Founders Fund which was co-founded by billionaire investor Peter Thiel. While he has extensive experince with high tech firms, he has no experience in the nuclear energy nor the uranium enrichment industries.

The co-founder of the firm is Lee Robinson who worked for the Defense Innovation Unit for about five years. Robinson’s expertise is in banking and finance. In a separate unrelated action this month, that agency entered into an agreement with Radiant Nuclear to deliver its HTGR microreactor to a USAF base.

NRC Regulatory Engagement Plan Pending

Last December General Matter submitted a Letter of Intent (ML24365A102) to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in anticipation of a “forthcoming application for the necessary licenses to support the production and handling of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU).”

The letter is signed by Ashby Bridges, VP of Facilities at General Matter. Prior work includes extensive experience in technical management of nuclear criticality operations at Los Alamos National Laboratory, URENCO, and Westinghouse, among others.

About six months ago, while still in so-called “stealth mode,” General Matter posted a recruitment notice on Linkedin for nuclear engineers with uranium criticality experience.

The General Matter plant has a reported estimated cost of $1.5 billion. The firm is reported to have raised $50 million. The funding round was led by venture capital firm Founders Fund, with partner Peter Thiel joining the board.

NRC Accepts GLE Application to License Its Laser Enrichment Plant

Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) announced that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has completed its acceptance review of GLE’s license application for the planned Paducah Laser Enrichment Facility (PLEF). The NRC’s acceptance confirms that the application is sufficiently complete to proceed to formal review marking a major step forward in GLE’s mission to deploy new U.S.-based depleted uranium tails re-enrichment and low enriched uranium production capacity. This plant is distinct from the one planned by General Matter which is expected when built to produce HALEU levels of enriched uranium (10-19% U235).

GLE said the PLEF is expected “to play a pivotal role in rebuilding and strengthening the domestic supply chain for uranium, conversion, and enrichment services. By re-enriching the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Paducah inventory of depleted uranium tails.”

Support cleanup activities from DOE legacy activities,

Reduce dependence on foreign fuel sources from state-owned entities, and

Lead efforts to re-establish Paducah’s historic role in the U.S. nuclear energy ecosystem.

GLE said in its press statement it remains on track to begin re-enriching the DOE’s Paducah inventory of depleted uranium tails no later than 2030.

Uranium can be enriched by separating isotopes of uranium with lasers. Molecules can be excited by laser light; this is called photoexcitation. Lasers can increase the energy in the electrons of a gaseous form of a specific isotope, changing its properties and allowing lighter U235 to be separated from the heavier U238.

Lightbridge Nuclear Fuel Ready for Irradiation Tests at INL

Lightbridge Corporation (Nasdaq: LTBR), a leader in advanced nuclear fuel technology, today announced the successful fabrication of coupon samples using enriched uranium-zirconium alloy, a critical step in the development of its next-generation Lightbridge Fuel product. The samples are representative of the fuel material alloy composition Lightbridge plans to use in the commercial fuel product designed to improve the performance and safety of nuclear reactors worldwide.

Key highlights of this achievement include:

Successful Extrusion of Enriched Uranium-Zirconium Alloy Samples: Lightbridge has successfully extruded enriched uranium-zirconium alloy samples that match the fuel material alloy composition intended for its future commercial Lightbridge Fuel product. (photos)

Utilization of Proven Fabrication Process: The extrusion process was performed using Lightbridge’s proprietary fabrication method, previously demonstrated at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to extrude and co-extrude depleted uranium samples with zirconium-alloy cladding. This proven technology is now applied to the enriched alloy for further development.

Collaboration with INL for Irradiation Testing: The enriched coupon samples will be placed into capsules and undergo irradiation testing at INL’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR). This work is conducted as part of an existing Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Lightbridge and the Idaho National Laboratory.

Irradiation Testing to Support Regulatory Efforts: The planned irradiation testing program, along with post-irradiation examination activities (the scope of which will be detailed in a future Project Task Statement), is aimed at generating critical irradiation performance data for Lightbridge’s advanced fuel. This data will play a key role in supporting the company’s regulatory licensing and commercialization efforts for deployment of Lightbridge Fuel.

Saudi Arabia Re-ignites Quest for US Support for its Commercial Nuclear Reactor Program

A trade newsletter on energy issues, “Tactical Report” has an unverified report that Saudi Arabia is once again playing the “China card” in its negotiations with the US over enrichment and nuclear energy issues. The full text is behind a very expensive firewall so all I have is a brief summary.

As far back as 2019 Saudi Arabia said if it could not get an acceptable deal, that includes uranium enrichment, it would turn to China for nuclear reactors.

The latest bulletin from Tactical Report (firewall) includes a few new data points.It indicates that Saudi Arabi’s ruler Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud (MBS) will seek reactors from South Korea.

This quest is problematic for South Korea given its relations with the US. Specifically, South Korea is prohibited via its 123 Agreement with the US from exporting its commercial light water reactors to any country that does not also have a 123 Agreement with the US.

Saudi Arabia does not have one and has consistently resisted progress towards a 123 agreement due to its demands for the right to enrichment. The US has maintained that Saudi Arabia can get the nuclear fuel its needs for commercial reactors without having an enrichment facility. Nonproliferation experts have pointed out the Saudi enrichment plant could lead to a nuclear weapons program.

Separately, an earlier report in April “Tactical Report” indicated that MBS was also interested in fusion energy, which does not require uranium enrichment. However, the timeline for commercialization of fusion is likely in the early 2040s according to the UK Atomic Energy Agency which is investing in fusion full tilt at Culham in the UK to shorten that timeline.

Why Raise the Issue Now?

The fact that Saudi impatience with US negotiations over support for its nuclear program has apparently re-surfaced may be related to the dire circumstances in Gaza foreclosing any rapprochement with Israel thus removing it from consideration in US / Saudi relations. By taking diplomatic relations with Israel off the table, Saudi Arabia can now pursue a bilateral nuclear deal with the US without any baggage from its prior proposals for a three-part deal.

However, given the short attention span of the Trump administration, embroiled in multiple controversies like the Epstein files, tariffs, and whatever other domestic distractions consume the White House, getting its concerted focus on Saudi Arabia’s nuclear demands may be a stretch.

Trump has promoted nuclear energy in the US with four executive orders intended to brighten the nuclear energy industry’s domestic prospects, and maybe add export opportunities.

However, the Trump administration recently stumbled badly in its efforts to control the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by firing its chairman, setting off a storm of controversy. Last weekend, in an apparent effort to repair the damage, the White House nominated a replacement who is well qualified for the job. Taken together this is a case of singed fingers quickly removed from contact with hot surfaces.

As the NRC is part of the government involved in reviewing and approving 123 Agreements, it is difficult to see a fast path for the US to grant Saudi Arabia permission in a 123 Agreement to pursue enrichment. The outlook for now appears to be a continued stalemate on the issue.

Saudi Arabia’s claims to play the China card is a thin boast given the impact it would have on US relations, especially in terms of military arms deals and deterrence against Iran, and the degree of control it would give China over Saudi long term energy security. Why MBS is pushing the issue now remains a bit of a mystery.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bsnf-large-rail-transport.png,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:20.388975

In our study, we separated the natural climate variations from changes driven by human-caused climate warming.” “Our results suggest that as climate warming trends continue, this pattern will likely persist, with earlier starts to fire seasons in the coming years.","Key takeaways

Human-caused climate change was responsible for a six-to-46-day earlier start to fire season in California between 1992 and 2020, increasing the period in which large swaths of the state were susceptible to destructive burning.

California’s fire seasons likely will continue to get longer and potentially more destructive as climate warming trends continue.

Supported by the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, future studies like this one are threatened by recent funding freezes and cuts.

The typical start of fire season in California has shifted earlier by an average of more than one day every year in most of the state since the early 1990s, and up to a total change of month and half earlier in some areas, a trend driven by human-caused climate change, according to a UCLA study published in the journal Science Advances.

This trend — even more pronounced in California's higher-elevation mountains and northern forests, where fire season has expanded by an average of two days every year in the same period — likely will continue as climate change continues to warm the planet, according to the study, which was made possible with support from the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. In parts of California over the last 30 years, warming has pushed the wildfire season anywhere from a week to almost seven weeks earlier.

“These findings underscore the very real impact climate change has on people’s lives and livelihoods,” said Alex Hall, a co-author of the report and director of both the Sustainable LA Grand Challenge and Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, or IoES.

“The critical importance of climate research cannot be overstated. This year is on track to be the most destructive — and costly — in California history as a result of fire. It is essential that we have the resources we need to do this necessary work, producing rigorous, accurate and societally relevant knowledge that can help policymakers make informed choices as they plan for a changing future,” Hall said.

The study found that fuel aridity — the dryness of typical fire fuels like grasses and trees — had the strongest influence on year-to-year shifts in the timing of the onset of fire season, and fuel aridity is largely affected by climate conditions.

“Year to year, there will always be some natural fluctuations,” said Gavin Madakumbura, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at UCLA. “Some years are wet, others dry. Some years are hotter than others. In our study, we separated the natural climate variations from changes driven by human-caused climate warming.”

“Our results suggest that as climate warming trends continue, this pattern will likely persist, with earlier starts to fire seasons in the coming years. This means longer fire seasons, increasing the potential for more of the state to burn.”

The impact of this trend is most acute in California’s northern mountains, where snowpacks have historically kept the ground and vegetation wetter for longer stretches, but in warmer years, when the snowpack melts earlier, the fire potential rises earlier too.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/173/files/20257/6896165e2cfac259967a0ede_Wildfire+2017+Robert+Giovannetti+BLM/Wildfire+2017+Robert+Giovannetti+BLM_mid.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 12:04:17.970669

This dislocation is where unsolicited bids emerge as a powerful indicator.
The Mechanics of Opportunity Distressed energy assets are not just cheap—they are mispriced.
Unsolicited bids for distressed assets are a symptom of this complexity, but also a tool to navigate it.","The energy sector is in a state of quiet rebellion. While the S&P 500 has rallied on the back of AI optimism and consumer discretionary stocks, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) has lagged, declining 0.4% in May 2024 alone. This divergence is not a temporary blip—it is a signal. A signal that the market is undervaluing a critical asset class: distressed energy infrastructure. And for investors with the patience and vision to navigate the sector's turbulence, unsolicited bids for these assets are becoming a goldmine of opportunity.

The Case for Undervaluation

The energy sector's underperformance is rooted in a collision of forces. Regulatory tailwinds favoring renewables, the lingering shockwaves of the 2022 energy crisis, and the slow burn of industrial demand deceleration in developed economies have left many energy firms with balance sheets stretched to their limits. Consider the numbers: the VIX, a barometer of market fear, has fallen 273 basis points month-to-date in May 2024, reflecting a broader risk-on sentiment. Yet energy stocks remain shackled by their own sector-specific headwinds.

This dislocation is where unsolicited bids emerge as a powerful indicator. When a private equity firm or sovereign wealth fund makes a non-conforming offer for a distressed oil field or a stranded gas pipeline, it is not merely a transaction—it is a vote of confidence in the asset's intrinsic value. These bids often surface when traditional buyers are hesitant, signaling that the market's current pricing does not reflect the asset's long-term potential.

The Mechanics of Opportunity

Distressed energy assets are not just cheap—they are mispriced. Take, for example, a hypothetical scenario where a midstream operator with $5 billion in debt and underperforming shale assets receives an unsolicited bid from a European energy conglomerate. The bid, while below the asset's historical revenue multiples, may reflect the acquirer's strategic calculus: access to U.S. infrastructure, tax incentives for decarbonization, or a bet on a near-term rebound in natural gas prices. For the seller, this is a lifeline; for the buyer, it is a chance to acquire assets at a discount while repositioning them for the energy transition.

The Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cuts in late 2024 and 2025 will further amplify this dynamic. Lower borrowing costs will make restructuring debt-laden energy projects more feasible, while the broader liquidity infusion will encourage investors to take on risk. High-yield energy bonds, which have outperformed their peers despite weak fundamentals, are already a harbinger of this trend.

Strategic Considerations for Investors

For those looking to capitalize on this landscape, the key lies in discernment. Not all distressed assets are created equal. Investors must differentiate between temporary mispricing and permanent impairment. A coal-fired power plant in a state with aggressive renewable mandates is a different proposition than a Gulf Coast refinery with access to low-cost feedstock and export markets.

Moreover, regulatory risk remains a wildcard. The Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for clean energy and the EPA's methane rules could render certain assets obsolete or costly to operate. Conversely, they could also create value if the acquirer can pivot the asset toward hydrogen production or carbon capture.

The Road Ahead

The energy transition is not a binary switch—it is a mosaic of opportunities and challenges. Unsolicited bids for distressed assets are a symptom of this complexity, but also a tool to navigate it. For investors willing to do the homework, these bids offer a chance to acquire assets at a discount, restructure them for sustainability, and ride the next phase of the energy cycle.

In the coming months, watch for two trends: a surge in cross-border deals as European and Asian firms seek U.S. infrastructure, and a rise in “green” repositioning of brownfield assets. The market may not yet see the value in these properties, but the next wave of energy leaders will.

In the end, the energy sector's current pain is a prelude to its next chapter. For the patient and the bold, the undervalued assets of today could be the cornerstones of tomorrow's energy portfolios.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 09:00:12.976788

FPL and multiple intervenors filed a joint motion today asking the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) to suspend technical hearings on FPL's original rates petition so that a settlement agreement can be finalized and filed with the PSC. The parties plan to work to finalize and file the agreement by Aug. 20.

A word from FPL President and CEO Armando Pimentel: ""We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with key stakeholders. A settlement would provide a win for our customers and the state of Florida. We appreciate the constructive engagement of key intervenors. Any agreement that we reach should enable FPL to continue to make smart investments on behalf of our customers, ensuring that we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low.""

Participants: The agreement in principle is supported by the Florida Retail Federation, Florida Industrial Power Users Group, Florida Energy for Innovation Association, Walmart, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, EVgo Services, Fuel Retailers, Electrify America, the Federal Executive Agencies and Armstrong World Industries.

How we got here: With FPL's current four-year rate agreement set to conclude at the end of this year, FPL on Feb. 28 submitted a petition to the PSC to set new rates for 2026 through 2029. That kicked off an extensive public review process in which FPL submitted thousands of pages of witness testimony and documents in support of its proposal. FPL responded to more than 3,000 interrogatories and requests for documents from 13 intervening parties and FPL witnesses participated in more than 30 depositions. The PSC conducted 10 public hearings across the state in May and June in which hundreds of customers weighed in on FPL's proposal.

What's next: FPL and the supporting parties will appear before the PSC Monday to ask commissioners to suspend the technical hearing to allow the parties to finalize the agreement. If the PSC accepts the motion, a new hearing date will be set to review the finalized agreement. Any new PSC-approved rates would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

In 2023, The US Department of Energy awarded a $114 million grant for the new nickel processing plant.
There's no organized opposition to the nickel plant in Beulah.
If approved, the company expects both the mine and the nickel processing plant to be operational in 2029.","The United States has been so worried about trade imbalances for basic raw materials that it set aside tens of billions of dollars to support new domestic mines and metal refineries. The President even invoked the Defense Production Act to get the Pentagon involved.

That president was Joe Biden. President Trump is picking up where Biden left off, and making even more investments.

One which is getting support from the Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law is in the central North Dakota town of Beulah, population 3,000. Coal and farming have been the economic anchors here for decades. Now, a former coal mine is set to be transformed into the site of a new processing plant for nickel ore coming from Minnesota.

""Basically when you put all your eggs in one basket and something changes, it makes it difficult for your community to thrive and continue to grow"" said Beaver Brinkman, Beulah's Economic Development and Operations Director. ""Hopefully, this will take and diversify our economy.""'

In 2023, The US Department of Energy awarded a $114 million grant for the new nickel processing plant. Nickel is used in electric car batteries. Tesla signed a contract for 75,000 metric tons from the plant.

It's also used in computers and to strengthen steel. Retired four-star Marine General John Allen says that makes nickel a strategic asset.

""What the Pentagon's trying to do is to lock in and preserve these raw materials for the highly sophisticated technologically advanced warfare that the United States wields today,"" he said.

Talon Metals owns both the Minnesota mine and the proposed processing facility in Beulah. The Pentagon gave Talon a $20 million matching grant to look for more minerals in the US. New mines don't open very often here, and refineries to process what comes out of them are even more rare.

""The United States and Europe and other of the technologically advanced societies sort of backed themselves into an environment where we imported a lot of these materials, mostly from China,"" Allen said.

Allen is on the board of the US arm of a security-oriented think tank called GLOBESEC. They estimate China controls 75% of the world's critical metals and mining materials.

Talon vice president Jessica Johnson welcomes the federal backing.

""Across multiple administrations, I think it's clear that domestic raw materials for our supply chains, everything from clean energy technologies to our defense and national security platforms and technologies– it's a bipartisan issue,"" she said.

There's no organized opposition to the nickel plant in Beulah.

Over breakfast at the Country Kettle restaurant, retiree Garry Teske says it sounds like it could bring some good jobs. But he'd like to know more.

""I have nothing against it but it's pretty hush hush around here,"" Teske said. ""We don't hear much.""

Talon's Minnesota mine is facing some opposition from a neighboring tribe and environmental groups. If approved, the company expects both the mine and the nickel processing plant to be operational in 2029.

Nevada has had a 20-year Colorado River drought and a 150 foot drop in Lake Mead water levels over that same period.

A recent report by nonprofit Western Resource Advocates said that NV Energy demands between 2023 and 2035 are expected to grow as much as 54%.

“This demand is being driven primarily be unprecedented projected load growth in NV Energy’s northern service territory,” read the report. The report authors added that in the northern service territory, “almost all of the new requests – approximately 5,900 MW – are due to 12 high-load factor data centers.”

Data centers are undergoing a boom period across the U.S., largely thanks to the growth of the energy-intensive artificial intelligence models that have become widely used in recent years.

The data centers host the computer systems that run these massive models, and in order to do so require city-sized levels of power. The Department of Energy reported that data centers in 2023 used roughly 4.4% of total U.S. electricity – but are expected to account for 6.7% to 12% by as soon as 2028.

In Nevada, between the Las Vegas area and the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center (TRIC) outside Reno, there are currently 59 data centers, as per Data Center Map.

At TRIC, a new $3 billion facility by Vantage Data Centers is expected to open early 2026.

“Nevada provided us a strategic opportunity to accelerate time-to-market for our customers while supporting the local economy through the creation of long-term jobs and tax revenue,” Vantage Data Center’s regional president, Dana Adams, wrote in a statement,

The new facility is expected to employ over 1,200 people but place a further strain on the area’s energy and water needs.

Water usage by these data centers, which is commonly used to cool down the potential overheating of the computers, has led to further regulation in Southern Nevada. In 2024, a ban was placed on systems that allowed the water to evaporate after helping to cool down the systems with most of the used water now required to be sent back to Lake Mead.

“If somebody came in with an evaporative cooling system in their development today, they would not get development approval,” Southern Nevada Water Authority spokesman Bronson Mack told the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Lula’s environmental credentials are under close scrutiny in advance of the annual UN climate summit in November in the Amazon city of Belem.","Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has signed into law a bill easing environmental licensing rules, but bowed to pressure from activist groups as he vetoed key provisions that would have made it easier for companies to secure environmental permits.

Lula approved on Friday what detractors have dubbed the “devastation bill”, but struck down or altered 63 of its nearly 400 articles, his office’s executive secretary, Miriam Belchior, told reporters.

The president had faced mounting pressure from environmental groups to intervene in the bill, which was backed by Brazil’s powerful agribusiness sector and focused on rolling back strict licensing rules that had kept the destruction of the Amazon rainforest in check.

A previous version of the bill adopted by lawmakers last month would have meant that for some permits, all that would have been required is a simple declaration of the company’s environmental commitment.

Lula’s revisions, however, reinstated the current strict licensing rules for strategic projects.

Belchior said the new proposal sought to preserve the integrity of the licensing process, ensure legal certainty, and protect the rights of Indigenous and Quilombola communities.

She added that Lula will introduce a “Special Environmental Licence” designed to fast-track strategic projects while filling the legal gaps created by the vetoes.

“We maintained what we consider to be significant advances in streamlining the environmental licensing process,” she said.

Nongovernmental organisation SOS Atlantic Forest, which garnered more than a million signatures calling for a veto of the law, hailed Lula’s move as “a victory” for environmental protection.

Lula’s environmental vetoes

Of the provisions struck down by Lula, 26 were vetoed outright, while another 37 will either be replaced with alternative text or modified in a new bill that will be sent to Congress for ratification under a constitutional urgency procedure.

Securing support for the amendments is far from guaranteed for the leftist leader. Brazil’s conservative-dominated Congress has repeatedly defeated key government proposals, including overturning previous presidential vetoes.

Lawmakers aligned with embattled ex-president Jair Bolsonaro are also blocking legislative activity amid an escalating political standoff, as they call for the former president’s charges around an alleged failed coup attempt in 2022 to be dropped.

Speaking at a Friday news conference in the capital, Brasilia, Environment Minister Marina Silva maintained a positive tone, telling reporters that Lula’s vetoes would ensure that “the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation”.

“We hope to be able to streamline licensing processes without compromising their quality, which is essential for environmental protection at a time of climate crisis, biodiversity loss and desertification,” said Silva.

Silva said a previous version of the bill, approved by Congress last month, threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030 and described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing framework.

But, she said, Lula’s revised version meant Brazil’s “targets to reach zero deforestation” and its goal to “cut CO2 emissions by between 59 percent and 67 percent remain fully on track”.

Market Segmentation:

Electricity Production to Lead the Market (by Application)

Electricity production represents the largest application segment in the small modular reactor market, driven by growing requirements for clean and reliable energy. SMRs deliver efficient and safe electrical output, supporting diverse deployment scenarios. In August 2023, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation announced a partnership to advance a commercially viable molten salt SMR, demonstrating industry commitment to next-generation reactor technology.

SMR site flexibility is a significant advantage for power applications. These reactors can operate in locations unsuitable for conventional facilities, including isolated areas and small communities. This capability addresses localized energy demands and strengthens energy security. In October 2023, NuScale executed a memorandum of understanding with Argentina's Investigacion Aplicada (INVAP) to assess the deployment of the VOYGR SMR system, reflecting global interest in SMR-based electricity solutions.

Expansion of the SMR sector in power generation is set to reshape the energy market by introducing a lower-emission, sustainable alternative to conventional power plants.

Water-cooled reactors represent the largest product segment in the small modular reactor market by reactor type. Their dominance reflects a proven performance record in the nuclear sector, straightforward design, and robust safety features. An established supply chain for water-cooled components reduces development costs and accelerates project schedules compared to emerging reactor technologies. Regulatory agencies possess extensive experience in licensing and supervising water-cooled reactors, which streamlines approval processes for SMR deployments.

China demonstrated this trend in January 2024 when its ACP100 SMR, a pressurized water reactor, was connected to the national grid. Research into alternative reactor concepts, including molten salt and high-temperature gas-cooled designs, continues. Market projections indicate that water-cooled SMRs will maintain their leading position due to their reliability and proven technological base, ensuring their status as the preferred solution for low-emission electricity production.

25-100 MW to Lead the Market (by Power Generation Capacity)

The small modular reactor market is shifting to reactors with a production capacity of 25 to 100 MW, establishing this segment as the leading category in power output capacity. Several factors contribute to this segment's prominence, including versatility, cost-effectiveness, and suitability for a variety of applications.

This capacity range delivers a strong balance between scalability, cost-effectiveness, and grid compatibility, positioning it as the industry's preferred segment. It supports a broader array of deployments than smaller units, delivering dependable power to remote communities and industrial sites and supplementing existing power grids. Modular design enables incremental capacity expansion by adding individual units, reducing upfront capital requirements compared to a single, large-scale reactor.

Recent developments highlight the 25-100 MW segment's lead. Government plans announced in November 2023 will deploy a fleet of next-generation SMRs rated between 40 and 70 MW, highlighting official support for this class of low-emission baseload power. Future SMR designs may diversify market offerings. Smaller units under 25 MW can serve niche requirements, and larger designs above 100 MW can cater to densely populated regions and major industrial complexes. The 25-100 MW segment is expected to maintain its leading position.

Its scalability, cost structure, and grid compatibility make 25-100 MW SMRs an adaptable and attractive choice for diverse power generation needs.

The grant program, known as Solar for All, was created by the Biden administration to bring cheap, affordable solar energy to low-income households.

Connecticut received $62.4 million from the program last year. The state was planning to use that money to help thousands of households transition to solar through an initiative called Project SunBridge.

The project was focused on multi-family affordable housing units with participants of the program estimated to save about 20% off their energy bill, according to the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP).

But the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled the program on Aug. 7. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the grant was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law passed by President Trump last month.

DEEP said it received notice from the EPA Thursday night that the grant had been immediately cancelled.

Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, decried the cancellation in a statement Friday afternoon.

“At a time when households could benefit from transitioning to solar energy now more than ever, the Trump administration is attempting to terminate a program that would lower energy costs for families and businesses while also delivering clean energy,” Lamont said. “These funds belong to the taxpayers of Connecticut.”

FPL and multiple intervenors filed a joint motion today asking the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) to suspend technical hearings on FPL's original rates petition so that a settlement agreement can be finalized and filed with the PSC. The parties plan to work to finalize and file the agreement by Aug. 20.

A word from FPL President and CEO Armando Pimentel: ""We are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle with key stakeholders. A settlement would provide a win for our customers and the state of Florida. We appreciate the constructive engagement of key intervenors. Any agreement that we reach should enable FPL to continue to make smart investments on behalf of our customers, ensuring that we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low.""

Participants: The agreement in principle is supported by the Florida Retail Federation, Florida Industrial Power Users Group, Florida Energy for Innovation Association, Walmart, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, EVgo Services, Fuel Retailers, Electrify America, the Federal Executive Agencies and Armstrong World Industries.

How we got here: With FPL's current four-year rate agreement set to conclude at the end of this year, FPL on Feb. 28 submitted a petition to the PSC to set new rates for 2026 through 2029. That kicked off an extensive public review process in which FPL submitted thousands of pages of witness testimony and documents in support of its proposal. FPL responded to more than 3,000 interrogatories and requests for documents from 13 intervening parties and FPL witnesses participated in more than 30 depositions. The PSC conducted 10 public hearings across the state in May and June in which hundreds of customers weighed in on FPL's proposal.

What's next: FPL and the supporting parties will appear before the PSC Monday to ask commissioners to suspend the technical hearing to allow the parties to finalize the agreement. If the PSC accepts the motion, a new hearing date will be set to review the finalized agreement. Any new PSC-approved rates would take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

Long a gas-weighted pure play, Jonah Energy is adding to its holdings and looking to grow its footprint across shale plays in the Lower 48.

The family office-backed company closed in July on its acquisition of High Plains Natural Resources with partner Burk Royalty Co. Ltd. The acquired assets include some 61,000 net acres and 250 operated wells across Yoakum County, Texas, and Lea County, New Mexico, in the Northwestern Shelf of the Permian Basin’s San Andres formation.

The wells are expected to produce an average of 15,000 boe/d during the third quarter with a product mix of 50% oil and 75% total liquids. The acreage position also includes substantial drilling inventory with development expected to commence in 2026.

The deal “enhances our cashflow and footprint in the Permian Basin following our successful acquisition of Tap Rock earlier this year,” said Jonah Energy CEO Brian Reger. “It aligns with our disciplined strategy of expanding in high-quality plays and strengthens our position as a leader focused on responsible, long-term value creation.”

In January, the company closed on its acquisition of Tap Rock Resources, an NGP-backed Delaware Basin producer in New Mexico. It was the first foray outside of the Rockies for Jonah, which has plans on growing well beyond the region.

Reger told Hart Energy that during the last two years, the firm has been building its foundation for growth, and that’s where the Tap Rock acquisition and more recent High Plains buy come in.

“Now we're executing on that plan, so the Tap Rock deal was the first of many,” Reger said.

Jonah is generally agnostic toward both basin and commodity, he said.

“We're looking to grow and gain cash flow and see where it takes us.”

While Jonah’s position in the Delaware is surrounded by larger players, the company isn’t interested in selling, Reger said.

“Our owner is a long-term investor. He wants to grow this business and hold this business for a long time,” he said. “There may be assets here and there where we look to do that, but generally we're looking to gain assets, not shed assets.”

The Delaware opportunity was a chance to obtain additional acreage and production from offset operators looking to get cash to invest in their own developments. It also realigns the firm’s resource blend.

Achieving balance

“We are much more balanced liquids to gas than we were a year ago, and the most recent acquisition is even more oily, so we are getting more liquids rich,” Reger said. “Having liquids and oil assets in our portfolio helps manage risk, so we're balanced in our approach.”

Jonah is interested in growth via M&A and is open to bolt-ons at any point.

“Our growth is coming in a couple of different phases, and the current phase of growth is more focused upon value add and scale for new basin entries,” Reger said. “Once we've established ourselves in a handful of basins, then I think we pivot our focus to bolt-ons and consolidating those positions. But it's a challenge to get acreage in the Delaware.

The Green River is already fairly well consolidated, so we're going to have to go to new basins, and figure out which ones those will be, where we can get good value, and then try and grow them from there.”

This summer, Jonah added a rig—its first in a couple of years—to the field in Wyoming.

The firm took the first six months of the year to evaluate whether to add a rig in the Jonah Field.

“Certainly the volatility in the market and the uncertainty there has made that decision challenging, looking at both commodity prices and well costs, particularly casing pipe. Every day the economics change pretty significantly, but we were comfortable enough to pull the trigger,” Reger said, adding that the firm expects to run the rig through the end of the year and perhaps during 2026.

Green River focus

The Tap Rock assets likely won’t be further developed near-term, but Jonah is looking at building its production in Wyoming.

“Right now, it’ll be focused on the Green River,” he said.

The Jonah Field development will consist of horizontals and verticals, he said. The plan is to drill seven wells initially through the end of the year. At that point, Jonah will evaluate whether to continue the drilling program.

Reger said the Tap Rock acquisition is well-developed, and most of the benches have been drilled, so there is less work to do in the Permian.

Both assets possess “great rock,” but the Green River asset grants access to West Coast markets for gas, “which really helps with the economics,” Reger said.

The verticals are needed to infill existing wells that are upward of 10 years old; the horizontal drilling is taking place on the edges of the field.

Jonah largely consolidated the Jonah Field itself in 2017 when the firm spent some $566 million to add Linn Energy assets to its footprint in the Green River Basin in Wyoming.

Today, the firm operates 100% of the wells in the Jonah Field, including the 500 wells Jonah has drilled, producing almost 2 Tcfe (trillion cubic feet equivalent). The company also holds a position in the Pinedale Anticline with authorization to develop another 3,500 wells in the 141,000 acres surrounding the Jonah Field.",https://www.hartenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_650x650/public/image/2025/08/jonah-energy-closes-high-plains-buy-bid-become-big-player.jpg?itok=tONBRH8R,N,,2025-08-09 07:01:13.278317

During a news conference at Embaras bar and grill in Villa Grove, owner Ryan Garett said his energy costs have skyrocketed in just one month.

“You get a $3,000 bill when you're not really expecting it. It raises your costs $1,000 in a month, you can't budget for that,” Garett said. “You can't plan for that. And then, it has a trickle down effect. We're at the point where we've had to cut back on hours for some of our employees and take up those hours ourselves because we can't, you know, keep up with payroll to pay that stuff.”

State Rep. Brad Halbrook, R-Shelbyville, said while Gov. J.B. Pritzker blames the increased costs on grid operators and President Donald Trump, Democrats need reverse course.

“The very communities the governor and his allies claim to help have been abandoned under [the Clean and Equitable Jobs Act] and its predecessor to the Future Energy Jobs Act of 2016, Illinois has been shutting down affordable, reliable coal and natural gas plants, so sources that actually work and are critical to grid stability,” Halbrook said. “But why? To appease the climate alarmists who think we can power Illinois with windmills and wishful thinking.”

State Rep. Chris Miller, R-Oakland, said it’s time to ditch the “green energy scam.”

“We have over 200 billion tons of big, beautiful coal available. All we have to do is go get it,” Miller said. “It would be a tremendous driver for jobs and opportunity. This whole CEJA thing, this whole green energy scam needs to be thrown in the garbage where it belongs.”

The Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition put the blame on increased energy prices on the Trump administration's roll backs of tax incentives for “clean energy” and “Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers.”

Latest tariffs raise concerns over economic activity

Trump threatens further sanctions on buyers of Russian oil

Putin and Trump to hold meeting in coming days, says Kremlin

(Reuters) – Oil prices edged higher on Friday but was poised for the steepest weekly losses since late June on a tariff-hit economic outlook and a potential meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

Brent crude futures were up 52 cents, or 0.78%, at $66.95 a barrel by 1104 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 43 cents, or 0.67%, to $64.31.

Brent was on track to be down 3.9% over the week while WTI was set to finish 4.5% lower than last Friday’s close.

Higher U.S. tariffs against a host of trade partners went into effect on Thursday, raising concern over economic activity and demand for crude oil, ANZ Bank analysts said in a note.

The latest tariffs arrive against a backdrop of an already weaker than expected U.S. labour market and Thursday’s announcement by the Kremlin that Putin and Trump would meet in the coming days as trade tensions rise between the U.S. and Russia’s oil customers.

Trump this week threatened to increase tariffs on India if it kept buying Russian oil, which the market viewed as putting further pressure on Russia to reach a deal with the U.S., said independent analyst Tina Teng.

Trump also said China, the largest buyer of Russian crude, could be hit with tariffs similar to those levied against Indian imports.

The potential meeting raises expectations of a diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine, which could lead to eased sanctions on Russia, with Russian stocks rallying after the news.

“There could be a meeting between Trump and Putin in the near future, which could indicate that Trump is adopting a wait-and-see approach with regard to further sanctions against Russia and its allies,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.

However, some analysts remain cautious.

“The Russian leader is expected to insist on having his territorial demands granted, a hard sell for the invaded country, while his U.S. counterpart will push for a ceasefire,” said PVM analyst Tamas Varga.

“No breakthrough is anticipated, and the U.S. following through on its threat to impose secondary sanctions on those dealing in Russian energy – including China and India – remains a possibility.”

President Trump’s tax and spending megabill slashed incentives for wind and solar energy that were part of the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to significantly stifle the build-out of the growing industry.

And in recent weeks, his administration has taken further actions to hamper wind and solar power.

To catch you up:

Shortly after the bill passed, Trump directed the Treasury Department to take a strict approach in limiting which projects are eligible for the remaining tax credits.

The Interior Department also recently announced it would subject wind and solar projects to an elevated review process — a move that was expected to slow down their approvals.

Last week, Interior said it would try to block projects that take up a lot of room, which is expected to primarily hurt solar and wind projects.

The department said last week that it would weigh “whether to stop onshore wind development on some federal lands and halting future offshore wind lease sales.”

It also moved this week to try to cancel an already approved wind project in Idaho.

The Environmental Protection Agency separately announced Thursday it would move to claw back funds under a $7 billion rooftop solar program.

The Interior Department’s elevated review processes are expected to pertain not only to wind and solar farm approvals but also include a wide range of activities such as grants and assessments of endangered species impacts.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Solar Energy Industry Association, said he expects some of these reviews would not only delay projects on public lands but could have similar effects on projects on private lands.

“We are hearing about dozens, if not hundreds of projects in the aggregate that otherwise are totally sited on private lands, totally permitted by state and local authorities, but that the Interior Department seems to have found a way to put into limbo, at least for a time,” Norris told The Hill.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/Renewables_120923_Illustration_CourtneyJonesAdobeStock-copy.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-09 08:02:51.653426

Once a follower in automotive innovation, it now poses the biggest challenge to Tesla, the industry’s original disrupter. Homegrown firms such as BYD, Xiaomi, and Li Auto have combined aggressive pricing, technological sophistication, and state support to outpace Tesla—especially in the Chinese market, the world’s largest for EVs. China’s dominance is no longer confined to the domestic sphere; it is steadily reshaping the global auto industry.

China’s EV transformation has been over two decades in the making. From early investments in research and manufacturing in the 2000s, the country has built scale and efficiency. By 2024, China accounted for nearly 40% of global EV sales, with 13 million electric and hybrid vehicles sold that year.

BYD, which began as a battery maker in 1995, has become a symbol of this shift. In the first half of 2025, it sold 2.1 million new energy vehicles (NEVs), including over a million battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In contrast, Tesla sold 720,803 BEVs during the same period. BYD’s vertical integration—from battery production to cargo shipping—enables it to keep costs low. Some of its models retail for under $10,000 in China, compared to $42,990 for Tesla’s base Model 3 in the U.S.

Similarly, Xiaomi’s SU7, launched in 2024, undercuts the Model 3 by roughly $2,500 in China, offering a larger battery and superior in-car features such as heads-up displays. These price differentials, coupled with rapid innovation, are winning over consumers.

EVs as consumer electronics

What sets Chinese EVs apart is their approach to vehicle design and user experience. While Tesla emphasises minimalist aesthetics and autonomous driving, Chinese firms treat EVs as extensions of the consumer electronics ecosystem. Features once considered luxury—augmented reality displays, in-car refrigerators, and roll-down projector screens—are becoming standard in models from Li Auto and Huawei-backed Aito.

This smartphone-like approach to car design resonates with Chinese consumers who prize entertainment and tech integration. Tesla’s functionalist design, by contrast, appears austere and culturally disconnected.

The battery edge

Battery technology—accounting for roughly 40% of an EV’s cost—is another area of Chinese strength. The Blade battery, developed by BYD, offers durability and cost-efficiency and has been adopted by Tesla and Toyota for some models. Chinese firms are also compressing vehicle development cycles to as little as 18 months, compared to the typical five years taken by foreign brands. This speed allows them to push out tech-forward models with regularity.

China’s ascendancy in EVs is the result of deliberate industrial strategy. Between 2016 and 2022, the Chinese government poured $57 billion into the sector through subsidies, tax breaks, and consumer incentives. The result has been a fiercely competitive market, with more than 100 EV models launched in 2024 alone.

Tesla’s entry into China with its Shanghai Gigafactory in 2020 was a catalyst for local players. The so-called “catfish effect”—where the presence of a strong competitor spurs incumbents to innovate—played out as Chinese firms responded with speed and agility. Now, that effect has turned on Tesla. In January 2025, Xiaomi delivered 22,000 SU7 units compared to Tesla’s 8,000 Model 3s in China. Tesla’s share of China’s NEV market has slipped from nearly 9% in 2024 to 6.5% in the first seven months of 2025.

Lessons for India

China’s EV story holds important lessons for India. Beijing’s consistent policy support—through subsidies, infrastructure investment, and targeted industrial policy—has enabled local firms to build robust supply chains and achieve scale. This policy-driven cost advantage is one that Tesla cannot easily replicate.

India, too, must adopt a long-term, strategic approach to EVs, not just as a climate solution but as an opportunity for industrial and technological leadership. The development of battery manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and local component ecosystems should be central to this strategy.

The global push and Tesla’s bind

Chinese EV makers are now looking beyond domestic dominance. BYD, Chery, and Great Wall Motor are expanding aggressively in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe. BYD alone exports to over 80 countries and is investing in R&D centres, warehouses, and service hubs across continents. In Europe, Chinese EVs captured 8% of market share in 2023, up from less than 1% in 2019—despite rising tariff barriers.

Tesla, meanwhile, faces a narrowing window. With limited product diversity and higher price points, it is ill-suited for price-sensitive markets such as India and China. Its cultural fit and innovation cycle appear sluggish next to Chinese competitors. While tariffs in the US and Europe may offer temporary protection from Chinese imports, this buffer may not last.

The shift underway in the EV sector marks a deeper reordering of the global automotive value chain. China is no longer just a manufacturer of cheap goods—it is now a laboratory for next-generation mobility. The future of the EV industry is being designed and built in Shenzhen, not Silicon Valley.

For Tesla and other Western automakers, the challenge is to adapt or fall behind. For countries like India, the challenge is to learn from China’s playbook before the opportunity to build domestic champions vanishes. The EV revolution may have started in the West, but its next chapter is being authored in the East.",https://www.policycircle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EV10.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:59:41.853446

Miles O’Brien: So why would a diversion project be controversial at all?","Geoff Bennett:

The iconic Mississippi River Delta is of enormous importance to the country, especially near the Gulf Coast. More than two million people live near that part of the Delta. It's an economic engine home to tourism, fisheries, and a shipping gateway to North America.

And it's also a key wildlife habitat. Nearly 40 percent of the coastal wetlands in the contiguous U.S. is found in the Delta in Louisiana. But it's shrinking considerably due to a number of factors, including engineering done some decades ago.

Our science correspondent, Miles O'Brien, looks at those problems and efforts to prevent further loss.

Miles O’Brien:

She and her team are studying the mud in the place they call the Bird's Foot, so named because of the way the Mississippi River spreads out into three canals at its mouth.

By the time the river wends its way here to its marshy mouth, where soil, river and sea mix in a swampy gumbo, the Mississippi is depleted of much of its famous mud.

Miles O’Brien:

The oil and gas industry is also to blame locally and globally. Sea level is rising more than three-quarters-of-an-inch a year here due to the climate crisis, and all the fossil fuel extraction that occurs in the region leads to the dredging of deep channels and the construction of pipelines.

It all hastens the sinking of the Mississippi River Delta, so-called subsidence. On average, the Delta loses about a football field of wetlands every 100 minutes.

Miles O’Brien:

The challenge is to find ways to divert Mississippi mud into the marshland without affecting navigation on the river.

Jeff Corbino, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The idea that the Mississippi River could be unleashed and magically nourish all these areas, it sounds very romantic. It just doesn't work that way in practice.

Miles O’Brien:

Right now, the Corps is dealing with orders to save as much of the dredge sediment as it can to nourish and sustain healthier wetlands.

Scientists on Sam Bentley's team are also hoping their data will inform efforts to design and build diversions to reroute and spread Mississippi sediment throughout the dying wetlands.

Miles O’Brien:

So why would a diversion project be controversial at all? Let's take a look at one of them to try to understand why. This is New Orleans here. Here's the Bird's Foot, and the river, which runs between the two of them.

In 2023, construction began on the $2.9 billion Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion. The idea, when the Mississippi had enough water to spare, water would be diverted into Barataria Bay right about here to make these wetlands more healthy.

But the problem is down here is a big oyster area, and the salinity of the water for oysters is very critical. This would have a great impact on those businesses. The oyster industry led the charge of opposition. Governor Jeff Landry withdrew state support, and the project is now dead.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/DisappearingDelta-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 08:03:15.168716

But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Donald Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

Over a dozen states are taking steps to address the issue, such as studying the impact on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay more for transmission costs.

States are under mounting pressure to shield household and business ratepayers from escalating electric bills, fueled by the energy-intensive operations of Big Tech data centers. Over a dozen states are taking proactive measures to address the issue, such as analyzing the impact on electricity costs and advocating for data center owners to shoulder more of the transmission cost burden.

PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. electric grid operator, has seen a significant surge in energy auction prices, which are projected to increase residential retail rates by 30% to 60% by 2030 [1]. The rising costs are primarily driven by the growing demand from data centers, which now account for over 90% of new power demand in the region [2].

In response, several states are exploring solutions. For instance, Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) has partnered with Google to implement a demand response program, allowing Google to shift electricity demand during peak times [3]. This initiative aims to reduce peak load and support sustainability and affordability of electric service.

Meanwhile, Microsoft is expanding its Mount Pleasant data center campus, investing $3.3 billion in the project [4]. The first phase is expected to be operational by early 2026, further adding to the demand on the power grid.

Some officials argue that the rising costs are due to the need to replace aging equipment and harden it against extreme weather conditions. However, consumer advocates contend that residential customers are subsidizing the AI ambitions of wealthy corporations, with utilities like AEP and Dominion increasing their capital expenditure plans to meet new data center demand [1].

The challenge is clear: balancing the need for economic growth with the sustainability of energy consumption. As data centers continue to expand, states must navigate a delicate balance between supporting technological innovation and protecting ratepayers from escalating costs.

Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization

Sometime in the early part of the 2020s we crossed an invisible line where the cost of producing energy from the sun dropped below the cost of fossil fuel. That’s not yet common knowledge—­we still think of photovoltaic panels and wind turbines as “alternative energy,” as if they were the Whole Foods of power, nice but pricey. In fact—­and more so with each passing month—­they are the Costco of energy, inexpensive and available in bulk. We live on an earth where the cheapest way to produce power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun; the second-­cheapest is to let the breeze created by the sun’s heating turn the blade of a wind turbine. Beginning about the middle of 2023, we entered the really steep part of this growth curve that could redefine our future, crossing another invisible line, this one marking the installation of a gigawatt’s worth of solar panels on this planet every day. (A gigawatt is about the output of a typical coal-­fired power plant or nuclear reactor.) By the fall of 2024 that gigawatt was going up every 18 hours. We’re still in the early days of this transformation—­right now only about 15 percent of the planet’s electricity comes from sun and wind, and only about a quarter of the energy we use comes from electricity. But exponential growth changes numbers like that very fast—­in 2024, 92.5 percent of all new electricity bought online around the world came from renewables; in the US the figure was 96 percent. By April 2025, fossil fuel was producing less than half of American electricity, for the first time ever. There’s no longer a technical or financial obstacle in the way; we already have the factory capacity, mostly in China, to produce as many solar panels as the climate scientists say we need. In May 2025 came the news that China had used 5 percent less coal in the first quarter of the year to produce electricity than it had in 2024—­despite a surging economy, Chinese emissions were actually dropping.

The suddenness of this moment is startling. The solar cell was invented in 1954, and it took from then until 2022 to install the first terawatt worth of solar power on this planet. It took two years to get the second; the third will be quicker still. It’s all brand new.

But there are a few places that are running far ahead, showing what’s possible. China is well on its way to being the earth’s first “electro-­state”; something like half of all clean energy has been installed within its borders. And 2024 was a breakout year in California: there were finally enough solar panels that for parts of most days the state could produce from renewable sources more than 100 percent of the electricity it used; at night great batteries that had spent the afternoon soaking up sunshine often became the biggest source of supply to the electric grid of the world’s fifth-­largest economy. As a result, in 2024 California used 25 percent less natural gas to produce its power than it had in 2023, which is a big number. Through mid-­April of 2025, as more panels and batteries came online, the numbers got even better: California was using 44 percent less natural gas to make electricity than it had just two years earlier. On the other side of the world, in Pakistan, a flood of cheap solar panels from China let homeowners and storekeepers and factory managers build the equivalent of a third of the country’s electric grid inside of a year. Peasant farmers, often just laying the panels on the ground, started pumping their irrigation water with electricity instead of generators powered with fossil fuels; diesel sales dropped 30 percent in the course of a year.

Those kind of shifts, replicated quickly in many more places, could take a real bite out of the grim predictions of climate scientists; the sun burns so we don’t need to. We are in a desperate race; those scientists have told us that to stay on anything like a survivable path we must cut greenhouse gas emissions in half before the decade is out. That target is on the bleeding edge of the technically possible, and this book is an effort to shove us toward that deadline.

Can The Rise In Solar Power Balance Out Clean Energy Cuts?

But I hope that this book is timeless as well—­that it’s anticipating a shift that will play out over many lifetimes, and in ways that diverge dramatically from our recent history. That’s because energy from the sun is not just cheap. It’s also diffuse, available everywhere instead of concentrated in a few places. And that prefigures a different world with a more localized and more humane geopolitics; indeed, the sun works more reliably toward the equator, which could allow the redress of some of earth’s great inequities. In February 2025 the energy analysts at the Rocky Mountain Institute reported that renewable energy was growing twice as fast in the developing world of the Global South as in the developed world of the Global North. Relying on energy sources that are abundant instead of scarce—­the sun and the wind each day produce thousands of times as much energy as we could ever use—­could even reconfigure our ideas of competition and conquest. Unlike oil and gas, sun and wind can’t be hoarded. If fascism scares you the way it does me, figuring out how to break the centralized power of the fossil fuel industry is a key form of resistance.

And for a species that has become almost fatally disconnected from the natural world, the sun offers a way back into a relationship with reality. We were all sun worshippers once; it’s not perhaps too much to imagine that we might someday soon gaze up a little more often, maybe even breaking a little of the enchantment woven by the glowing lights in our palms. This is not, I think, a “technofix,” but something far more fundamental. We have the chance to join in a great global project, providing affordable energy to every human community even as we stave off our greatest threat. It could prove a unifying mission for a divided world. The last remotely comparable project was the moon shot of the 1960s, but that involved one nation putting two men on an orbiting rock. This quest involves bringing our star down to earth to make that earth work—­what could be more quintessentially human?

All this hope risks sounding giddy; let my dark realism reassert itself for a moment and offer up some caveats and cautions. I’m not overly concerned about the things people usually point to. As I’ll make clear, we’re not going to run short of minerals to build batteries or land to put panels on. Instead, my worries stem from hard realities both physical and political.

First, this definitely comes too late to “stop global warming.” We’ve already done fundamental damage to the planet’s physical systems, to the point of altering the jet stream and weakening the Gulf Stream; we’ve already raced past the 1.5 degree Celsius rise in global temperature that we pledged in Paris to avoid. (In April 2025, the Trump administration fired most of the American scientists who monitor this increase, perhaps reasoning that what we don’t know can’t hurt us.)

Our best hope now is simply to stop the heating of the earth short of the point where it cuts civilization off at the knees, and even that will be a very close call. I will return to the question of pace over and over in these pages, because it’s what matters most. I have little doubt we will run the world on sun and wind 40 years from now, but if it takes us anything like 40 years to get there then it will be a broken planet; our energy sources will hardly matter. The march of history won’t get us where we need to go fast enough; we need to force that march.

Second, there’s no guarantee that the momentum of the last few years will continue. The fossil fuel industry has read the numbers too, and so they’ve girded for the fight. As the chairman of one big oil company said in the fall of 2024, the industry thinks we should keep burning gas and oil until “every last molecule” had been sucked from the earth. If you think that capitalism guarantees we’ll pick the lowest-­priced option, think again: In certain ways, solar and wind power are almost too cheap for our economy. Investors who have gotten rich controlling the hoarded “reserves” of fossil fuel are scared of the fact that the sun delivers energy for free each time it rises above the horizon, and in their fear they’re massively gaming our political system. The worldwide elections of 2024 saw setback after setback, with oil-­soaked populists winning control in too many places. Just as they played the game of climate denial with real success for three decades, they now engage in a kind of solutions denial, claiming we’re not ready for clean energy, or offering up substitutes closer to the status quo. Some of these substitutes (geothermal power and nuclear energy, if the cost ever comes down) may offer useful side dishes to the main course of sun, wind, and batteries; others (carbon capture from power plants, biofuels) are just expensive efforts to extend the business model of this industry a little longer. All of the substitutes are effective at distracting us, especially in the distorted infosphere of greenwash and spin we inhabit.

Nowhere, of course, is that distortion more powerful than the United States, where Trump rode back into office vowing to “drill, baby, drill” and to crash the electric vehicle (EV) industry. He’d been in office four hours when he signed an order ending all federal support for wind power. (As for solar energy, the week before the election he said, “It’s all steel and glass and wires. It looks like hell. And you see rabbits get caught in it.”) By April, just three months into his second term, Trump was announcing plans to revive the coal industry, and his bizarre tariffs were making life harder for renewable energy developers; he cut off funding to Princeton’s climate modelers on the grounds that their findings were causing “climate anxiety.” All of which is to offer a third caution: Just because the world goes in one direction, that doesn’t mean every nation will follow. Yes, there’s enormous momentum behind this transformation; on the last day of February 2025 the federal Energy Information Administration predicted that 93 percent of American electric generation built in Trump’s first year would be carbon-­free, mostly from solar. In the first month of 2025, as Trump was taking office, sun and wind combined made up 98 percent of new generating capacity in the States. But clearly the Trump/Musk team will try to break that momentum; already-­high tariffs on Chinese solar panels are being increased again even as I finish this manuscript, and the administration is embarked on a sprawling effort to achieve “energy dominance” based on oil and gas. It’s an effort to stuff the solar genie back in the barrel, and we don’t know yet to what degree it will succeed. The Biden administration, with the Inflation Reduction Act, set in motion transformative spending on clean energy technology, and spread the money carefully around the red states; Texas, home base of the hydrocarbon industry, is now outpacing even California in clean energy (though the state legislature, as of spring 2025, was engaged in an all-out effort to sabotage that growth). Power from the sun can appeal to conservatives (“my home is my well-­wired castle”) as powerfully as it does to liberals. But the addiction to fossil fuels and all its accomplices (the giant SUV, say) runs deeper here than anyplace else; it will be a fight to turn the American page.

I’m ready for that fight. Even as I write these pages, I’m helping organize what we’re calling Sun Day, set for the autumnal equinox in September 2025. Indeed, some of the proceeds from this book are supporting that organizing process, because its goal is the same: to help people understand the possibility of our moment. As we shall see, much of the progress that engineers have made has come on the back of inspired activism, something we need more of. In this fight, the solar panel and the wind turbine are both the crucial machines and also the symbols of potential liberation.

And in true Hollywood fashion, our liberation and our destruction are arriving at precisely the same time, offering us a remarkable choice. Everything is going wrong, except this one big thing. Our species, at what feels like a very dark moment, can take a giant leap into the light.

“The US Clean Air Act allows California, based on public health criteria, to go beyond what the US EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] may require.
“The governor can ask for a declaration from the president in an emergency,” DeSaulnier added.
The courts have always upheld it, so when California goes beyond the federal standards [for air quality] other states can join California.
California has never failed to be able to defend that” because the state carefully monitors emissions and air quality.","I recently spoke with U.S. Representative Mark DeSaulnier (D–CA), a former Republican turned Democrat representing California’s 10th congressional district just east of San Francisco Bay, about the climate emergency and the need to push beyond partisan acrimony to restore healthy oceans with innovative solutions.

DeSaulnier began by summarizing his background in working on climate. “In 1994 I was a Republican and was appointed by Pete Wilson, a Republican governor of California, to the California Air Resources Board — CARB,” he explained. “I spent a decade on CARB [serving] three governors, Wilson, Gray Davis (D), and Arnold ScImahwarzenegger (R). So, when I got elected to the legislature, I had a reputation [for] being knowledgeable about air quality.”

DeSaulnier went on to serve as chairman of CARB at the request of governors Davis and Schwarzenegger, and met with the current chair and executive director last spring. “We talked about how we can protect the California waiver from the Trump administration and…continue to do all the wonderful things we’re doing,” he said. “The US Clean Air Act allows California, based on public health criteria, to go beyond what the US EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] may require. And that’s the California waiver.”

The area DeSaulnier represents — San Francisco’s East Bay — houses five of the 13 refineries still active in the state of California, producing roughly 25% of the CARB-certified fuel and 50% of the diesel fuel in the state. In addition to the Bay Area, Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Puget Sound have the highest concentration of refineries. “The crude comes from the North Slope of Alaska and from the Pacific Rim, and… goes out to the rest of the country,” DeSaulnier explains. “So what I was actually talking to the CARB staff about was their modeling. At CARB we always said we’re agnostic about how we get to the totals –- we just need the emissions reduction. So we need to measure the emissions and model them accurately. Carbon being more ubiquitous is harder than traditional pollutants, but what we were talking about… was how [to] create a model between the workforce and the targets we have to meet, and then be agnostic.”

Congressman Mark DeSaulnier

When asked for his thoughts on ocean restoration strategies that hold great potential for both removing excess carbon from the atmosphere and boosting fisheries, DeSaulnier said, “if we discover that carbon capture naturally works, then [we should] do the analysis and, as you say, get the capture.”

Turning Around the Titanic

“We’ve got generations of work to do to transition our energy sources on this planet away from fossil fuel and greenhouse gas-emitting to more efficient renewables,” DeSaulnier pointed out. He also underscored the magnitude of figuring out how to transition an economy the size of California’s, which is the largest in the US and the fifth largest in the world, to solely rely on renewables.

The congressman agreed that “if you just shut [down] all these refineries and the fossil fuel industry today, yes, you would still have these other challenges,” including the lethal one trillion tons of extra CO2 humans have put into the atmosphere, which are estimated to take a thousand years to go away without any intervention. But he raised the question of how to model the risks and benefits to ensure that California is “protecting the environment long-term and not creating other [harmful] consequences” in the process.

I pointed out that the best model I have seen is the extremely safe 100 Villages action plan, which envisions one hundred fishing villages (or cities) around the world sending boats out to their ocean ecosystems and replacing the tiny amounts of missing nutrients that plankton need in order to flourish. Restoring plankton — the ocean’s equivalent to Amazon rain forests — is key to removing CO2 from the atmosphere and reducing ocean acidification, and has the potential to bring California’s fisheries back from disaster to a position of world leadership. The cost is low and could possibly be funded by blue carbon credits.

A Bipartisan Opportunity

I asked DeSaulnier whether he thought it would be possible to find common ground in Congress around legislation similar to the bill (HR 7797) sponsored by Representative Buddy Carter (R–GA) the last session, which proposed establishing a pilot program on ocean restoration research and development.

Carter complained that he was unable to find a Democratic cosponsor, saying that there were at least five who really liked the idea and were quite ready to back it, but were told by leadership not to for partisan reasons.

“I’m surprised to hear about Democratic members not wanting to partner because I haven’t experienced that,” DeSaulnier said. “I’m thinking of a very good friend of mine I’ve known for a long time, Jared Huffman. He’s a ranking Democrat on the Resource Committee [who] represents [the state] from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon border, the California coastline. And he’s a former NRDC [Natural Resources Defense Council] attorney who specialized in oceans and water, so he would have the seniority, jurisdiction, and the background, right? The natural person.” DeSaulnier promised to talk to him about Carter’s bill, saying he “would be very surprised” if his friend isn’t interested in signing on, adding that the way “you get bipartisanship is just [by building] relationships and working with people.”

Declare an Ocean and Fisheries Emergency

As I reminded the congressman that the flag of LA County has a tuna on it because California was the tuna capital of the world as recently as 1950, I mentioned a new tactic to try to get bipartisan progress that is championed by the president of OPR ALASKA, Russ George: Declare an ocean and fisheries emergency based on the collapse of California’s fisheries. By focusing on the fact that the acidification of the oceans due to rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a leading cause of the demise of fish, Congress could generate the resources needed to fund an action plan for ocean restoration to bring fish back while removing significant amounts of ruinous CO2.

“I’d have to look into it,” DeSaulnier said. “I am the ranking Democrat on the ethics committee, and we have rules about how we handle state and local policy. It’s not like we can’t do this, but we have to comply with the political side as well as the taxpayer-funded part of it. And my recollection of FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] laws is the governor [needs to ask] the president to declare [an emergency]. And I’m not sure [if] Congress would go around that, other than legislatively confirming it budgetarily.

“The governor can ask for a declaration from the president in an emergency,” DeSaulnier added. “But this president is unhinged when it comes to fossil fuels, climate change, and science.”

I noted that in this case there is a great advantage to focusing on the economic reality for the fishing industry instead of mentioning climate so that the president and other climate deniers might consider it.

“That is possible,” DeSaulnier replied. “What I always try to do on the climate change issue is refer to an existing model and say something like, ‘the Chinese are approving this as a better economic model.’ And in your case of letting nature heal itself, of allowing that to happen, this is the most efficient from a business model standpoint, not to mention all the other benefits.”

DeSaulnier also mused about a potential legal path. “[Another option] is the California waiver I mentioned earlier, which has never been denied since Richard Nixon signed the [Clean Air Act in 1970]. This allows many good actions but this president wants to ignore it. The courts have always upheld it, so when California goes beyond the federal standards [for air quality] other states can join California. In the Clean Air Act, there is an allowance for public rights of action, which are lawsuits. So, if you have standing, California can sue. California can say, well, you didn’t provide the needed requirement under the US Clean Air Act. California has never failed to be able to defend that” because the state carefully monitors emissions and air quality.

“If you were to use the current statute, California and the California Air Resources Board and the State Water Quality Board, in this case, would have to have their staff develop findings saying if you do this, the planet and the ocean will produce these levels of emission reductions over this period of time. So that’s why other states are allowed under the Clean Air Act to do what California does beyond what the US EPA does, and they’re not preempted, they’re actually defended under federal law.”

Since our interview, Republicans in Congress managed to use a controversial tactic to revoke California’s waiver, which Governor Gavin Newsom (D) has challenged in court. DeSaulnier has denounced the revocation as “blatantly illegal.”

The aggressive move highlights the critical need to transcend the partisan divide, for example by tackling the crisis in our oceans and fisheries by declaring an Ocean Emergency.

DeSaulnier wrapped up our interview with a sincere expression of wanting to absorb more information about ocean restoration. It was an inspiration to interview an elected leader who can think on his feet, adapt to updated scientific findings, and contribute such positive guidance on bridging the political divides on the most existential issue of our time.",https://www.exposedbycmd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DeSaulnier-Climate-Action.jpeg,N,,2025-08-09 07:01:00.670545

Cailian, August 9 (Editor Zhao Hao) Automotive industry analysts stated that U.S. consumers are rushing to buy electric vehicles to take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit before the deadline.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive, said, 'With the tax incentives set to end, we expect the third quarter to potentially set a record for EV sales as people rush to make their purchases.'

Last month, both chambers of the U.S. Congress passed the so-called 'Big and Beautiful' bill, which was strongly promoted by President Trump. The bill stipulates that the U.S. government will no longer provide tax credits for electric vehicles starting September 30 of this year.

According to data from Cox Automotive, U.S. consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest on record, just behind the approximately 136,000 units sold in December last year.

Streaty added that July sales increased by 26.4% compared to June and by nearly 20% year-over-year. She also noted that EVs accounted for 9.1% of total passenger car sales in July, setting a new record.

Liz Najman, Director of Market Insights at Recurrent, an EV market and data provider, said, 'We are seeing very strong new EV sales.' Meanwhile, used EV sales in July also reached nearly 36,700 units, setting a new monthly record.

Previously, S&P Global analyst Tom Libby pointed out that the cancellation of the federal tax credit would 'jeopardize' the price competitiveness of EVs, as the price gap with gasoline vehicles 'no longer exists.'

Analysts say that dealers are also leveraging the upcoming September 30 deadline to create a sense of urgency and boost sales. As of the time of writing,$Tesla (TSLA.US)$The top of the U.S. website homepage is boldly stating: 'The $7,500 federal tax credit is about to end.'

Streaty from Cox Automotive expects that, as the tax credits expire and the market adjusts to the new financial reality, electric vehicle sales may ""plummet"" in the fourth quarter of 2025.

In today’s feature report, we will listen to Part 3 with WFHB Environmental Correspondent Max Jancich as he speaks with Greg Olsen, Field Projects Director at the Sand County Foundation. Olsen discussed prairie strips, a conservation practice that integrates prairie ecosystems into 10-20 percent of farmland to improve water quality and soil health.

And now for your environmental reports:

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting announced last Friday that it will begin shutting down, weeks after Congress canceled previously approved funding for the nation’s steward of public media access.

The cost of hurricanes, floods, and fires is increasing every year. In year 2000, FEMA spent $3.6 billion; adjusting for inflation, that’s $7 billion in today’s money. This year, FEMA budgeted $36 billion. Thus, the vast difference reflects a much greater cost of disasters nowadays. There’s no mystery as to why this has occurred – we are increasing our fossil fuel consumption. The President is also gutting pollution regulations and agencies protecting the environment. He’s firing expert scientists and replacing them with youngsters with little or no science background.

The E.P.A. said this week it would revoke its own ability to fight climate change. It’s the latest move in an extraordinary pivot away from science-based protections.

Earth’s Wetlands are disappearing and global efforts to save them are unraveling. More than 170 countries have gathered to save critical ecosystems. But the U.S. was a no-show for most of the summit and Russia said it will withdraw from the wetlands treaty.

Sweden, an early climate leader, is retreating from its environmental commitments, part of an EU trend. As the U.S. abandons international climate agreements, the EU is hesitating to lead. A once-admired Nordic nation’s backtracking on its climate goals offers clues as to why.

The Bureau of Land Management calls new Oil and Gas Rules ‘noncontroversial,’ exempts them from public comment. Environmentalists say the lack of public comment shows the administration’s disregard for maintaining public lands.

The potato is eaten throughout the globe, but the plant’s origins have remained obsure. Now scientists can, and the answer is: tomatoes. According to a study published last week, potatoes may have arisen nine million years ago through the combining of genetic material from Etuberosum, a group of potato-like plants from South America, and wild tomato plants. According to the study, this hybridization event led to the origin of the potato plant’s distinctive feature, the tuber, an underground structure that stores nutrients and, as humans eventually discovered, is edible.

Candidate Trump Promised Oil Executives a Windfall. Now, They’re Getting It. New tallies of the administration’s tax breaks and other incentives add up to tens of billions of dollars of benefits to the fossil fuel industry.

Joining Growth Energy in celebration of the August 8th birthday are leaders from across the heartland, who have helped to make the RFS America's single most successful policy for increasing U.S. energy security, holding down fuel costs, reducing emissions, and strengthening the farm economy.

Since the RFS became law in August 2005, American biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol. In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers. As a result of these benefits, the program is supported by a broad, bipartisan spectrum of stakeholders.

Growth Energy

""The RFS is the foundation of America's bioeconomy,"" said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. ""It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it's still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren't yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.""

Farmers

""The RFS is more than a law. It's a vital outlet for surplus grains that provides stability and prosperity to American farmers facing higher input costs and uncertain export markets,"" said Bill Couser, a farmer from Iowa who grows commercial corn that he sells to local plants to be processed into fuel ethanol. ""I don't know that our family's farm would be as strong as it is today if it weren't for the RFS and the American biofuels industry.""

""Since the RFS was enacted, America's net farm income has more than doubled. In Iowa alone, biofuel plants purchase more than half the state's corn crop — transforming it into homegrown fuels, high-quality animal feed, food-grade CO2, and a host of other co-products,"" said Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a third-generation corn and soybean farmer based in northwest Iowa. ""It's an integral part of the agricultural supply chain.""

Lawmakers

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard program has helped us produce fuel that reduces our emissions and fosters energy independence—and I'm proud to help continue leading the push in the Senate to increase the use and supply of American-grown, American-made biofuels across the country,"" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). ""We're pushing hard for our bipartisan bill to enable the year-round sale of E15 nationwide, and as founding co-chair of the Sustainable Aviation Caucus in the Senate, I'm working to bolster and help expand our nation's sustainable aviation fuel industry. Investing in American biofuels doesn't just help us reduce our nation's carbon footprint—it helps lower gas prices for middle-class families and support our farmers. It's a win-win-win that would not be possible without the RFS.""

""Over the last 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been essential to empowering heartland communities, adding value to crops grown by our hardworking farmers, securing American energy independence, and giving consumers a cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). ""Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation's future. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration to ensure the RFS stays strong, so we can keep delivering for Iowa's famers, biofuel producers, and rural communities.""

""Nebraska is the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol, and much of that is made possible by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established 20 years ago,"" said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). ""The RFS has played a critical role in supporting Nebraska's ag economy, driving both the use and production of renewable fuels across the state. I look forward to continuing to work with the EPA to ensure a strong RFS that will further advance Nebraska's biofuels industry.""

""The Renewable Fuel Standard is one of the federal government's most successful clean fuels policies,"" said Senator Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.). ""For two decades, renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have saved consumers money, supported Nebraska agriculture, cleaned our environment, and unleashed American energy.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has created incredible new opportunities for our farmers. I've seen firsthand the important markets it creates for our corn and soybean growers, and the cost savings it brings for folks at the pump,"" said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). ""As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15.""

""A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels,"" said Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa). ""For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities.""

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has provided long-term market certainty and predictability for American biofuels producers, fuel retailers, farmers, and other market participants,"" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa). ""It's incredible to see how far we've come in blending more homegrown biofuels into our nation's fuel supply—and how the RFS supports Iowa farmers and rural communities. Biofuels play a crucial role in our energy strategy to bolster energy independence and lower costs for consumers. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration and my colleagues in Congress to expand the use of biofuels as part of an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy.""

""I'm proud to support access to new markets for our nation's farmers that strengthens our domestic energy resources,"" said Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio). ""Investing in American biofuels strengthens our energy supply, creates good-paying jobs, and drives economic growth in communities that feed and fuel our nation. By advancing biofuel innovation we're building a more secure, independent, and prosperous future for the American people. As we mark 20 years of the Renewable Fuel Standard, we recognize one of the most impactful commitments our nation has made to energy security and rural prosperity.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a cornerstone of our nation's energy policy—strengthening rural economies, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating new markets for our family farmers,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.). ""In Illinois and across the Midwest, biofuels mean good-paying jobs, cleaner air, and opportunity. As we look ahead, we must ensure the RFS translates to affordable low-carbon options for consumers while supporting industry growth domestically. I'll continue fighting to make sure biofuels remain a key part of America's energy future.""

New Jersey residents are struggling to afford their energy bills.
In other words, those companies could sell customers gas power, as they purchase credits from wind, solar and nuclear plants outside of New Jersey.","The stakes are high.

The losses have been mounting.

And the odds of success are as long as they’ve ever been.

Still, according to a Politico report this past week, the Murphy administration and some Democratic lawmakers are doubling down on the governor’s goal of having New Jersey generate all its electric power from zero-carbon sources by 2035.

That push would come in the form of an updated bill during the year-end, lame duck legislative session.

By codifying the main thrust of Murphy administration’s Energy Master Plan into law, New Jersey ratepayers – who are already looking at 20% energy hikes this summer – can expect higher energy bills and less energy reliability going forward, said NJBIA Deputy Chief Government Affairs Officer Ray Cantor.

“The Legislature needs to understand that this is only going to worsen our affordability and reliability issues,” Cantor said.

“As we said when the Energy Master Plan was introduced six years ago, you cannot put ideology ahead of practicality as part of an energy transition. The rate increases and sticker shock in our electric bills resulting from New Jersey going from a net exporter of energy to a net importer of energy is something we and others predicted six years ago.

“We continue to stress: New Jersey still very much needs an all-of-the-above approach if its energy transition is to work. And, yes, that includes clean natural gas, which currently accounts for nearly half of our total electricity generation and 72% of our home heating fuel.”

“Put simply, it's imperative to bridge that disconnect between aspiration and reality,” Cantor said.

UNSPOKEN CHILL FROM THE BILL

While an updated bill to 2023 legislation codifying the state gets its power from only zero-carbon sources has not been posted, Cantor said it’s possible that it will have language suggesting affordability protections.

Cantor, however, said he’s concerned that language will only be used to assuage the many New Jersey residents who are struggling to afford their energy bills.

“We don’t need window dressing, and we don’t need optics,” Cantor said. “What we need is more energy, not less.

“If this bill becomes law, we will have less energy. We will continue to see that supply and demand imbalance that we all forecasted long ago and is now happening. New Jersey residents are struggling to afford their energy bills. That will get worse by eliminating natural gas as a source of power prematurely.”

The 2023 bill did allow gas-powered energy companies to match renewable energy credits with each unit of electricity they sell. In other words, those companies could sell customers gas power, as they purchase credits from wind, solar and nuclear plants outside of New Jersey.

But Cantor said, beyond the concern of relying on other states for energy credits, such a provision only adds uncertainty and less investment from energy companies.

“You could have a power generator who may want to come here or expand here, but they need regulatory certainty in order to do that,” Cantor said. “This legislation, in any form, will disincentivize such investment at a time when we still very much need natural gas power.”

BLAME GAME

In a gubernatorial election year where high energy costs have become a prime issue, PJM Connection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 13 other states and the District of Columbia, has come under criticism by Gov. Phil Murphy and other Democrats for the way basic generation service costs are structured, as well as auction rules that exclude generation capacity from being sold.

Republicans, conversely, have placed the blame squarely on the “failed energy policies” of the Murphy administration, which saw a great emphasis on offshore wind that never materialized.

Cantor said the easiest way to observe where the true reason for blame resides in warnings issued by nonpartisan groups like NJBIA when the Energy Master Plan was announced in 2019.

“Those criticisms of PJM are not without some merit,” Cantor said. “You can also look at the speed of which interconnection approvals are made by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions as a contributing factor.

“But they are not the major thrust beyond the bill increases we are seeing this summer. New Jersey right now is a state that doesn’t produce enough energy to keep our own lights on, and we have advanced policies to eliminate sources that provide much of our electricity.”

“As we’ve said before, that’s not a winning combination when it comes to the balance of supply and demand. If the EMP is codified into law at the end of the year, we have grave concerns it will only get worse because there are no realistic plans in place to increase our in-state generation, while we all know our demand will continue to increase.”",https://njbia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/doubledownWebsite.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 03:58:03.880818

Developers and builders can and should be building net-zero ready houses with a HERS score at least in the 50s.","When Jodi Bakst started her career as a real estate agent, she didn’t know she would one day develop an entire community ... but that’s exactly the case now. Bakst started her career in environmental management, eventually pivoting to real estate and becoming the owner of an agency that has served North Carolina’s greater Research Triangle area for more than 28 years.

Combining her housing industry knowledge with her environmental background, Bakst co-founded Circular Design Construction in 2018 and is currently developing Array, the state’s first-ever 100% net-zero energy neighborhood. Featuring walking trails, a community garden, and a comprehensive approach to energy-efficiency, including rooftop solar panels, the 54-acre community will showcase 12 net-zero homes when complete.

PRO BUILDER: What led you to develop Array?

Jodi Bakst: Prior to becoming a real estate agent in 1998, I worked in environmental and economic development. I have a bachelor's degree in economics and a master's in environmental management. I worked in Washington, D.C. for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and an environmental law firm representing clients on environmental matters. In North Carolina I worked with Nortel and the State of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality.

Initially, I wanted the neighborhood to be off the grid but I came to learn that in North Carolina, a single house can be, but neighborhoods cannot. So, the next best thing was having (all the homes in) the neighborhood be net-zero.

PB: How far along is the development?

JB: The infrastructure is complete and all of the lots are sold. Three of the twelve houses are complete and occupied. Five more houses will be done by early next year, and a sixth one later in 2026. The rest of the lots will have homes in the next few years.

PB: What does it mean to be truly net-zero, and what steps can builders take to achieve this goal?

JB: All of the houses in Array will be built to or exceed the standards set out in the covenants for the neighborhood. The houses will, at a minimum, produce as much energy as they need to operate. This is what it means to be net-zero. I am incredibly proud of the results of the first three homes.

It is not difficult to be, at a minimum, net-zero ready. In Array, the additional costs to meet the standards without an on-site renewable energy source that get you to a home energy rating score (HERS) in the 50s (on a 0-100 scale] is just 2% of the overall building cost. Developers and builders can and should be building net-zero ready houses with a HERS score at least in the 50s.

To get to net-zero, add solar to produce all the energy the home needs to operate. The more energy-efficient the house, the smaller the solar array needs to be.

PB: For those who can’t achieve net-zero, what are some simple steps housing pros can take to reduce their impact?

JB: The simplest thing to do if you are building a home is orient it for passive heating and cooling. Then, use at least R-19 insulation in the walls and insulate so there are no air leakages, install energy-efficient doors and windows, Energy Star-certified appliances and, at a minimum, an 18-SEER, high-efficiency heat pump.

Things vary by climate zone, so it is important to pay attention to what’s best for your location. For example, in North Carolina, because the climate is moderate, triple-pane (window) glass is not necessary, but in colder climates it is something worth considering.

If you are retrofitting a home, the very best thing is to conduct a blower door test to find all of the air leakages in the house and tighten them up. Add insulation in the attic. Seal the crawl space and provoide conditioned air. And when it’s time to replace appliances, purchase Energy Star-certified products, high-efficiency heat pumps, and a high-efficiency heat pump water heater.

PB: What’s the current demand for energy efficient housing?

JB: There is a significant demand for energy efficient houses including net-zero ready and net-zero. The more that are built, the more people will come. Over the years, I have had hundreds of people come to Array, but no development or location is right for everyone. Many people ask me if I’m doing another development like Array in another part of town.

For some reason, builders resist building this way. The more energy-efficient houses in our market have HERS in the 60s. That’s much better than a code-built home at HERS 100, but they can do better.

PB: What’s been the biggest hurdle to getting this project off the ground?

JB: The biggest hurdle was the funding. I am a Realtor, not a developer. I thought the original land owner would be the developer and I would be the project manager. Once my client purchased the land, he told me he didn’t want to be the developer, but would let me develop it and pay him back later. I searched high and low for partners to develop the land with, but I turned up absolutely no one.

So, I had to make the decision to go this alone and decide how I was going to structure it. Once I wrote the first payment to the civil engineer, I had made the step to be a developer. After five years of hard work and absolute grit, I pulled it off with zero debt.

PB: Do you have future plans for similar developments?

JB: I do not. If someone comes to me and wants to partner or ask me to manage the project, I will absolutely consider it. My heart is in this. I feel very fortunate I was able to create Array and have it be such an incredible success.

It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.

But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.

That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.

Rising power bills are “something legislators have been hearing a lot about. It’s something we’ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I’ve ever seen before,” said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. “There’s a massive outcry.”

Not the typical electric customer

Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.

“A lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,” said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. “I think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.”

A fix, Peskoe said, is a “can of worms"" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.

Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.

Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia’s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.

The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.

But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.

Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren’t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.

In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes — residential, commercial and industrial — are likely paying for data center power needs.

Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% — or $9.3 billion — of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.

States are responding

Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers “paying billions more than is necessary.”

PJM has yet to propose ways to guarantee that data centers pay their freight, but Monitoring Analytics is floating the idea that data centers should be required to procure their own power.

In a filing last month, it said that would avoid a ""massive wealth transfer” from average people to tech companies.

At least a dozen states are eyeing ways to make data centers pay higher local transmission costs.

In Oregon, a data center hot spot, lawmakers passed legislation in June ordering state utility regulators to develop new — presumably higher — power rates for data centers.

The Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board says there is clear evidence that costs to serve data centers are being spread across all customers — at a time when some electric bills there are up 50% over the past four years and utilities are disconnecting more people than ever.

New Jersey’s governor signed legislation last month commissioning state utility regulators to study whether ratepayers are being hit with “unreasonable rate increases” to connect data centers and to develop a specialized rate to charge data centers.

In some other states, like Texas and Utah, governors and lawmakers are trying to avoid a supply-and-demand crisis that leaves ratepayers on the hook — or in the dark.

Doubts about states protecting ratepayers

In Indiana, state utility regulators approved a settlement between Indiana Michigan Power Co., Amazon, Google, Microsoft and consumer advocates that set parameters for data center payments for service.

Kerwin Olsen, of the Citizens Action Council of Indiana, a consumer advocacy group, signed the settlement and called it a “pretty good deal” that contained more consumer protections than what state lawmakers passed.

But, he said, state law doesn't force large power users like data centers to publicly reveal their electric usage, so pinning down whether they're paying their fair share of transmission costs ""will be a challenge.”

In a March report, the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard University questioned the motivation of utilities and regulators to shield ratepayers from footing the cost of electricity for data centers.

Both utilities and states have incentives to attract big customers like data centers, it said.

To do it, utilities — which must get their rates approved by regulators — can offer “special deals to favored customers” like a data center and effectively shift the costs of those discounts to regular ratepayers, the authors wrote. Many state laws can shield disclosure of those rates, they said.

In Pennsylvania, an emerging data center hot spot, the state utility commission is drafting a model rate structure for utilities to consider adopting. An overarching goal is to get data center developers to put their money where their mouth is.

“We’re talking about real transmission upgrades, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars,” commission chairman Stephen DeFrank said. “And that’s what you don’t want the ratepayer to get stuck paying for.""

Commission Chair Kevin Thompson hailed the collaboration among the state's major electric utilities as a pivotal move to meet the growing energy demands and strengthen Arizona's energy grid reliability.

Commissioner Rachel Walden emphasized the importance of the project for maintaining baseload power and attracting commerce by providing affordable power in combination with innovative approaches to water conservation. A marked increase in the state’s net summer capacity by approximately 1,490 MW has been reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, helping Arizona tackle its climbing energy needs and peak demands. In the past year and a half, nearly 1,000 MW of gas-fired capacity have come online from projects like Bella, Redhawk, and Black Mountain, complementing the expansion of the natural gas infrastructure.

Arizona's energy mix is broadly diversified with natural gas and coal delivering half of the state’s electricity; solar shines at 29 percent, while nuclear power contributes around 11 percent, and battery storage has edged up to supply approximately 9 percent of energy requirements. Vice Chair Nick Myers relayed satisfaction with the collaborative efforts undertaken with the utilities and the federal administration to enhance the state's gas infrastructure in anticipation of future energy needs.

Following the initiation by Vice Chair Myers, docket G-00000A-25-0029 serves as the procedural step to investigate potential growth in natural gas infrastructure and storage across Arizona. The first workshop discussing these themes is scheduled for August 26, and it will be accessible in person at the ACC's Phoenix location and online for wider participation. This discourse aligns with a broader strategy to not only expand existing energy sources but also to explore the feasibility of new nuclear power facilities.

Arizona residents and outside observers will likely keep a watchful eye on the workshop's outcomes and the ACC's ongoing efforts to shore up the state's energy infrastructure. With projects underway and investigative processes in motion, the future of Arizona's energy landscape is being crafted today, and it holds the promise of resilience and diversity in its portfolio.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/8/arizona-corporation-commission-champions-major-natural-gas-pipeline-to-bolster-state-s-energy-grid-1.webp,N,,2025-08-09 00:59:50.438648

In Pennsylvania, the Solar for All program never got off the ground.

Last year, the EPA awarded the Pennsylvania Energy Development Authority (PEDA) $156 million as part of the program to build rooftop solar on the homes of 12,500 low and moderate-income families across the state. It was intended to lower their energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

But there was a caveat: the Pennsylvania legislature required its own approval to accept the money. So far, it hasn’t done that.

Now that the EPA has announced it’s canceling those grants across the country, solar advocates in Pennsylvania are worried that lawmakers will never act.

“I am afraid of that being an excuse for not moving forward with the Solar for All authorization,” said Monica Carey, Pennsylvania program director of the non-profit Solar United Neighbors (SUN).

Carey still wants the legislature to approve the acceptance of this money. The EPA administrator has made his move, she said, “but that is not the legal finality of Solar for All…the money is contractually obligated, so it is legally PEDA’s to spend on Solar for All.”

She and other solar advocates are not surprised by the EPA announcement, but are still disappointed, “especially as electricity prices are set to rise dramatically,” said Leo Kowalski of the nonprofit Pennsylvania Solar Center.

“We’re having more and more electrification and data centers go in,” he said. “So it feels like a great time to be leading on that front, to be helping incentivize normal people to pay cheaper electricity rates when they’re the ones that are going to be footing the bill for these large entities.”

‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ casts shade over Pennsylvania’s solar boom

Republican lawmakers are skeptical of solar

At a hearing of the House Energy Committee in February to consider a bill to accept the Solar For All funds, Republicans brought up concerns about the disposal of solar panels, about free markets, and about the price tag of rooftop solar, even though the federal government had already allocated the money to Pennsylvania.

“Why in heaven’s name would we continue to invest taxpayer dollars, whether it’s state or federal? “ asked Rep. Jamie Barton, a Republican who represents Berks and Schuylkill counties, at the hearing. “Why would we invest in unreliable energy sources?”

That bill was derailed by an unrelated amendment. Now, advocates are concerned that there is no political will to approve the funding.

“To give up now is basically saying these low-income residents of Pennsylvania never mattered to us,” said Carey. [Lawmakers are saying] “‘we don’t care if they have to spend more on energy bills proportionally than anyone else in the state. We’re not going to do anything to help them.’ That’s what it feels like to just give up on Solar for All.”

Solar advocates see the best route now is through the state budget, but the legislature is at an impasse.

“The Solar for All program remains an important lifeline for the many working people and families in the commonwealth who need energy affordability,” said Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler, Democrat of Philadelphia, who chairs the House energy committee, despite the EPA canceling the program. “We’re still working hard in the legislature to authorize the program and move this funding out quickly, so as many Pennsylvanians as possible can benefit.”",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/solarmain.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 07:01:09.582277

Coal plants and mines are usually decades old, they’re high polluters, and they’re not making a profit.
In April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the production of coal by opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of coal plants across the country.","For a decade now, coal has been on the way out. The industry’s future was considered mainly dead and buried until the Trump administration decided to pull out every stop to dig it out of the grave. And this wasn’t caused by any “Green New Deal” boogeyman stuff: the coal industry does not have the economics to survive intense competition from less expensive alternatives.

Donald Trump’s efforts to revive coal will cost the U.S. time and money we can’t afford to waste, driving up energy costs for Americans and leaving the mining communities behind.

As we look toward the future, we should not be reaching backward for solutions to our energy supply.

Coal consumption for electricity has been in a steady decline since at least 2008 as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources gained a share of the supply. Coal plants generated only 15% of electricity in 2024, down from 19% in 2020 and 51% in 2001. Based on research from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, coal is expected to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade. The institute estimates that by 2030, 63% of the peak total of coal-fired capacity will be closed, and it’s possible that all remaining coal capacity still online at that point may be shuttered by 2040.

The arguments people made in the past about coal being economically profitable are no longer applicable. Coal plants and mines are usually decades old, they’re high polluters, and they’re not making a profit. A study from Energy Innovation finds that 99% of coal plants are more expensive to run than to replace with new solar or wind energy, and are getting more expensive to run by the day.

The median cost of new solar projects is $24 per megawatt-hour compared to a median marginal cost of $36 for the operations of existing coal plants.

What’s more, this is an industry that, on its way out, has prioritized taking care of its CEOs, not its workers. As major coal companies filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, executives got massive compensation increases while workers were laid off and employee benefits were slashed. As profits shrank, executives paid themselves more, while miners paid the price.

This is all to say nothing of the public health consequences, environmental damage and climate effects that coal mining and power production pose. Despite making up a minority of electric power generation, coal makes up more than half of all harmful climate emissions from the electric power industry. Coal-fired power plants also have detrimental effects on public health: they were responsible for 460,000 deaths between 1999 and 2020, and they have estimated health costs up to $26 billion annually.

Even as the Trump Administration has moved to block permits for wind and solar development and terminated federal clean energy investments that were already underway, it has thrown every subsidy in the book to revive the dying coal industry. In April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the production of coal by opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of coal plants across the country. Later that month, he also added coal to his list of “critical minerals” and has used his “energy emergency” as an excuse to push through new mines.

Earlier this summer, Congress enacted a costly taxpayer subsidy for coal mining as part of its budget bill that cut healthcare and clean energy investments. This attempt to prop up coal will come at the expense of people who have to pay higher electricity bills, or question the reliability of their energy.

Coal’s decline was a problem of economics, and its revival only works if Americans are willing to pay more for less. By trying to bring back the coal industry, this administration is fighting the free markets that have shifted away from expensive and polluting coal plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner energy sources.

The Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to fossil fuels threatens to make energy costs higher for Americans while continuing to ignore solutions to energy independence. The United States should let facts and economic realities take care of coal. What we need to focus on is affordable, abundant and clean energy sources.

GM says the tweaks made to the production Silverado EV Max Range WT used for the test were “all within the acceptable limits established in the truck’s owner’s manual.” The truck’s hardware and software were untouched.
According to GM, range is its number one purchase driver for the Silverado EV.
“Getting this kind of range on a full charge doesn’t happen by accident,” said Kurt Kelty, VP, battery, propulsion, and sustainability.","GM just set a new world record, driving 1,059 miles on a single charge with its 2026 Chevrolet Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck.

The company introduced the all-electric pickup truck in 2024, boasting more standard range than any competitor and a 10,000-pound towing capacity. The optimized 2026 model used by GM engineers for the record-breaking test has an EPA-estimated range of 493 miles.

Equipment World contributing editor Tom Quimby was impressed with the truck’s performance at its debut, calling it “the best case yet for an electric pickup.” To read about his 54-mile test drive, click here.

GM says the tweaks made to the production Silverado EV Max Range WT used for the test were “all within the acceptable limits established in the truck’s owner’s manual.” The truck’s hardware and software were untouched.

Over seven days, a team of 40 engineers drove the truck in one-hour shifts on public roads near GM’s Milford Proving Ground in southeastern Michigan, wrapping up the route on Detroit’s Belle Isle.

To ensure that as much battery energy as possible was going toward moving the truck forward, modifications to the truck and the driver’s operating habits were made. Adjustments included:

When the speed limit and conditions allowed, drivers were advised to maintain an average speed of 20-25 mph and to minimize any hard braking or quick accelerating.

For most of the test, there were no passengers in the truck.

The windshield wiper arms were set to the lowest acceptable position to reduce drag.

Tires were inflated to their highest acceptable pressure for lower rolling resistance.

To lighten the vehicle, the spare tire was removed.

The wheel alignment was optimized.

An accessory tonneau cover was added for smooth airflow.

Climate control was turned off for the duration of the test.

The test was performed in summer to ensure the optimum ambient temperature for battery efficiency.

GMThe team found the Silverado EV’s most efficient cruising speed to be 20-25 mph. At that speed, the truck used nearly all of its battery power to move down the road, with minimal energy going to other uses.

Jon Doremus, propulsion calibration engineering manager, said, “If we drove it downhill the whole time, sure, we’d get insane mileage. But that’s not what this was about. We wanted this to be real, on public roads.”

The feat broke the world record of 749 miles set by the Lucid Air Grand Touring earlier this summer. According to GM, range is its number one purchase driver for the Silverado EV.

“Getting this kind of range on a full charge doesn’t happen by accident,” said Kurt Kelty, VP, battery, propulsion, and sustainability. “It takes deep integration across battery chemistry, drive unit efficiency, software and vehicle engineering—and that’s exactly what the team delivered. This achievement is a great example of how far our EV technology has come, and the kind of innovation we’re building on every day at GM.”

To top it off, the Silverado EV that set the record was recharged and powered up a 3D printer that printed a trophy to honor the team’s accomplishment.",https://img.equipmentworld.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/08/silverado-ev.vSL1da1mda.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-08-09 07:01:23.226748

Rivian's shares slid 4% after hours, and Lucid fell 7% after the company warned of a deeper adjusted core loss of $2 billion to $2.25 billion this year, up from its prior range. Tariffs have eaten into margins, and softer demand is expected in Q4 after the $7,500 federal tax credit expires.

Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers Rivian and Lucid are bracing for a challenging second half of 2025, as policy changes, trade tensions, and supply chain issues put pressure on the industry. Rivian's shares slid about 4% after hours, while Lucid fell roughly 7% following the companies' warnings of deeper adjusted core losses and softer demand expectations.

Rivian, which expects a deeper adjusted core loss of $2 billion to $2.25 billion this year, up from its prior $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range, cited policy changes and supply chain snags as key challenges. The company also noted that the expiration of federal EV tax credits has led to higher costs and shrinking regulatory credit income [1].

Lucid, which avoided the worst of the rare earth crunch by tapping into existing magnet inventory, still faces challenges from tariffs and softer demand expectations. The luxury EV maker cut its annual production goal and warned of softer demand in Q4 once the $7,500 federal tax credit expires at the end of September [1].

Analysts expect a rush of Q3 sales as buyers race to lock in the incentive, but the risk is that the pull-forward leaves a hole later in the year. Both companies are navigating a challenging environment for EV sales, with the loss of federal tax incentives potentially forcing price cuts to maintain demand [1].

Rivian's stock fell 4.4% to $11.62 in after-hours trading, while Lucid's stock fell 6.6% to $2.27. The EV industry as a whole has had a bumpy road of late, with Tesla reporting a 16% drop in net income in the second quarter and slowing sales [2].

The expiration of federal EV tax credits and the rewriting of policies around EV incentives by the U.S. government will create further headwinds for the industry going into the second half of the year. Rivian and Lucid, along with other EV manufacturers, will need to adapt to this new environment to maintain their growth trajectories [2].

California is facing a severe housing shortage. And in some places, namely Los Angeles, the need for new construction is even more dire because of recent wildfire destruction.

So in late June, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) prioritized faster construction over cleaner buildings with a law that pauses updates to state building codes for six years. It’ll also stop local jurisdictions from enacting their own stricter standards, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. The move comes after LA suspended its all-electric building requirements to speed its post-wildfire rebuilding efforts.

As it stands, California already has some of the strongest efficiency standards in the country. But this law will make it harder for progress to continue, stopping municipalities from implementing new rules that could, for example, encourage heat-pump adoption in multifamily buildings or mandate all-electric renovations.

And it may not even help the state cut home prices or speed construction. A 2015 study showed no significant correlation between California’s efficient building codes and construction costs, while a 2019 analysis estimated that building an all-electric home cost less than a gas-powered home in most parts of the state. A more efficient home also typically means lower power bills, which translate to even more savings.

On the other coast, a Massachusetts town is further boosting the case for efficient building codes, Canary’s Sarah Shemkus reports. In 2024, the Boston suburb of Lexington banned gas hookups in new construction and adopted an efficiency-boosting building code. The move hasn’t stymied development: Over the last two years, the town of 34,000 has still permitted around 1,100 new units of housing, 160 of which will be affordable. That aligns with a 2022 RMI study that found all-electric homes in Boston are slightly less expensive to build and operate than mixed-fuel homes.

Another state will soon test the balance between affordable and clean construction, Alison reports. New York just approved an all-electric building code that bars gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings. State officials estimate the new standards will end up raising construction costs, but the lowered energy bills they lead to should offset that increase within a decade.

More big energy stories

Solar for none?

The U.S. EPA says it will roll back more federal clean energy funding, this time targeting $7 billion earmarked for states, cities, tribes, and nonprofits under the Solar for All program. The program was created under the Biden administration to help low- and moderate-income households tap into solar power that can help lower their electricity bills.

The clawback comes just as grant awardees were starting to spend their federal dollars. Just this week, Georgia launched a program to let homeowners lease rooftop solar panels for free. Colorado is meanwhile finalizing three programs to boost solar deployment and workforce development. And as Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports, burgeoning projects all across the country could lose their funding, threatening new power generation that the U.S. needs if it wants to lower electricity prices and meet rising demand.

Advocates say the EPA doesn’t have the authority to claw back the money and promised on Thursday to sue, as Jeff reports in a follow-up piece.

A week of blows to renewables

It’s not just residential solar that’s in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. The administration has also issued a series of orders over the last two weeks targeting solar and wind development on federal lands and in federal waters.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum started by ordering his department to stop ​“preferential treatment for wind projects” and to evaluate whether to halt wind development on federal lands altogether. The next day, the Interior Department de-designated more than 3.5 million acres of federal waters previously slated for wind development, rendering offshore wind leasing ​“effectively dead” in the U.S., Canary Media’s Clare Fieseler reports.

Back on land, the DOI also issued an order that would consider a power project’s ​“density” before it’s approved. It’s a test that wind and solar are destined to fail, as they take up more land than gas power plants to generate the same amount of electricity.

MTERA, which received a $62 million grant award last year, had already laid groundwork for projects supporting each of its 35 member tribes in the Great Lakes region, Wiggins said. Now, that work is upended, with no clear path forward.

“This program was probably one of a kind - we had strategies in place to target every reservation in the Midwest,” Wiggins told Tribal Business News. “Pulling this money out from under us isn’t just devastating to the tribes, but to the communities and regions where those tribes reside — regions that would have had positive economic and environmental impacts with each of the subawards we were making.”

Solar for All is part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion clean energy program under the Inflation Reduction Act. Congress repealed the fund under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which President Trump signed into law on July 4, 2025. The fate of Solar for All under the new law remained unclear until Thursday, when EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced via a video post on X that the program would be terminated.

The EPA cited the law's passage as justification for terminating the program, with a spokesperson saying the agency is ""working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law.""

Zeldin said during the video that Solar for All funding was being “diluted” by its progress through primary awardees down to subawardees, sometimes changing hands up to “four times,” per his post. He did not provide evidence of the claim, and the EPA press office did not respond to emails or calls for comment by Tribal Business News.

“As many grants go into passthrough after passthrough, each middle man takes their own cut — at least 15% by conservative estimates,” Zeldin said in the video.

Before Zeldin’s announcement, rumors of a termination prompted a response from Indian Country, according to an op-ed published by Native News Online. The money would help provide everything from lowered utility costs to workforce development in supported areas, a coalition of energy experts wrote.

“It is clear that the electricity demand in this country is not diminishing any time soon,” Catherine Zingg, policy director for Tribal Energy Alternatives, said in a statement. “By disinvesting in our tribal communities that are still overly burdened, that face brownouts, that see some of the highest electricity bills, we are continuing the narrative to the American people that some communities matter more than others. More than unlawful, this is harmful to the tribes we work with.”

The Trump administration’s move to end Solar for All falls in line with other plans to terminate the rest of the greenhouse gas fund. That includes the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), which allocated $14 billion to develop “green bank” financing coalitions, and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which allocated $6 billion for localized financial support for renewable energy projects.

Both of those programs were subject to an attempted termination in March. In both cases, funds were already obligated — and just as financing coalition Climate United and others continue to challenge the EPA's termination efforts in court, so too will Solar for All grantees, Wiggins said.

“We’re looking at appealing the termination, if appeal doesn't work, we’ll consider other legal remedies,” Wiggins said. “In the meantime, we’re going to have to strategize and take a look at what we can do with some of our partners.”

One partner is the nonprofit Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy, which supports several Solar for All grantees. President and CEO Cheri Smith told Tribal Business News that the EPA’s termination of the program represented a “blatant assault” on tribal sovereignty — but one that the Alliance has been prepared for since the current administration took office.

“There will be lawsuits I'm sure. We are not waiting for those decisions, because time is ticking. These projects are shovel-ready and are losing momentum every day without disbursement,” Smith said. “We have a platform and capital stack planning tools and experts within our own team and we are planning to move forward and keep the consortia together with funding from other sources.”

Even with planned support from the Alliance’s Indigenous Power and Light Fund, disruptions lie ahead, EPA’s termination of Solar for All funds will halt momentum in communities that badly need it.

“This is eliminating energy poverty in the form of tribal members, especially in the plains and in the South where discriminatory energy rates are so high, tribal members are paying double or more. This was relief for those issues,” Smith said. “This isn't about politics, this really is human, very human. This is a humanitarian assault.”",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/Zeldin_X.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 11:03:05.898137

U.S.District Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle recently ruled after BlackRock, Inc, State Street Corporation and Vanguard Greoup, Inc., three of the largest investors in the world, had been accused by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton of acquiring “substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the United States” and agreed to use their holdings to influence these companies and artificially depress the output of coal.” Paxton’s lawsuit accused them of doing so in the name of “environmental stewardship” and “concern for the climate.”

Oklahoma joined the lawsuit in January 2025 along with Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Louisiana, West Virginia. Wyoming later filed a complaint as well.

Paxton contended “Defendants have reaped the rewards of

higher returns, higher fees, and higher profits, while American consumers have paid the price in higher utility bills and higher costs.” He accused the firms of violating state and federal lantitrust laws.

Paxton further claimed BlackRock had separately violated state consumer protection laws by advertising certain funds as not following an “ESG investsment strategy” while using the funds to pursue an ESG agenda through engagements and proxy voting.

The defendants attempted to have all of the claims dismissed. They also argued there was no violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but Judge Kernodle disagreed. “Defendants’ arguments that Plaintiffs failed to allege a conspiracy are unpersuasive.”

He further determined, “Plaintiffs may ultimately be unable to prove that Defendants entered into an agreement to pressure the Coal Companies that led to anticompetitive effects in the

relevant coal markets. But at this stage, Plaintiffs’ Section 1 claim is plausibly alleged. Accordingly, Defendants’ motion to dismiss is DENIED as to Count II.”

BlackRock’s effort to have count III dismissed was also denied. The claims by Oklahoma and the other states that BlackRock and other firms violated state anti-trust laws stood up as Judge Kernodle dismissed the investment companies efforts to have them thrown out.",,N,,2025-08-09 12:05:57.036785

PPL, which operates in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, claimed that it had 56 GW data centers come knocking, and Southern Company, which covers Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, claims that it has over 50 GW of prospective large load customers, many of which are data centers.
There are a huge number of data center speculators emerging: Organizations that track data center development show a rocketing number of real estate developers working to get in on the data center action.
According to data from 451 Research, there are at least 50 developers in the US looking to build significant (>50 MW) data centers that have little or no operational data centers in their portfolio.
Utilities tend to disclose only name-brand data center customers: While utilities may claim huge pipelines of data center customers, the fraction that they do discuss tend to be recognizable names.","Sir Martin Frobisher is the explorer that most of us outside of Canada never get to learn about. In 1577, after sailing past Greenland and getting stuck in the icebound northern reaches of what would become Canada, Frobisher came across a mountain of gold, and excitedly filled his holds to ship the riches back to England. Of course, had Frobisher or the assayers on his ship not slept through Geo 101, they would have known that the glittering hard, brittle crystals embedded in the shale ores weighing down his ships were pyrite - more commonly known as fools gold - a mineral formed from iron and sulfur. While lovely to look at, pyrite is mostly known for its hazardous explosive properties in coal mines and its insidious role in acid mine drainage. Frobisher’s haul was deemed useless, and ended up as the gravel bed to an English road.

Frobisher got off relatively easy. All that was lost were two ore-laden ships, a bit of Queen Elizabeth’s goodwill, and some of Frobisher’s seemingly boundless enthusiasm for misadventure.

The supersizing of data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) has put us in the midst of a modern rush for the hills, and while nobody knows if the hills are filled with proverbial gold or pyrite, the Queen’s wealth is once again going to build an armada in heady anticipation. Unlike Frobisher’s folly, however, the data center gold rush is impinging itself on a common good - the utilities and electric system upon which we all rely and pay for (and increasingly, our climate). The rush to build, and power, data centers offers an unprecedented opportunity for utilities, and an extraordinary risk - and ratepayers are unwittingly in the middle.

For many utilities, the data center boom came out of seemingly nowhere. As of late 2022, most utilities predicted steady, but slow electricity growth driven by new manufacturing, electric vehicles, and building electrification. The pace of forecasted growth had changed radically by 2024. Propelled by shock value of ChatGPT and other AI models, proposals for new data centers started cropping up in nearly every state, driven by both the name brand hyperscalers – like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft – and newly emergent developers.

The potential scale of data center growth is extraordinary. Observers estimate there could be well over 100 gigawatts (GW) of data centers online by 2030, consuming more than 15 percent of US electricity (and well above 25 percent in some states). Around 8 GW of data centers were built in 2024 alone, and there are an estimated 10 GW coming online in 2025, which will consume enough energy to power 8 million homes. Adding 100 GW of new demand by the end of the decade would be enough energy to power 80 million homes, or more than half US housing units.

While the enormity of the current data center sector is deeply impactful for the utilities that have to react to this system shock, it pales in comparison to what utilities are being told to expect by data center developers moving forward. Based on utility filings and investor presentations, the Sierra Club uncovered two dozen utilities that collectively claim they’ve been approached with over 700 GW of data center development (non-cryptocurrency mining, a whole other ballgame), or enough energy to consume every unit of electricity produced in North America in 2024 - and then more.

For example, Oncor, a Texas-based electricity delivery company, claimed it had been approached by 156 GW of data center interest (equivalent to the entire US coal fleet), while FirstEnergy, an Ohio-based utility, claimed it had been approached by 80 GW of data center developers (just under the capacity of all US nuclear plants). PPL, which operates in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, claimed that it had 56 GW data centers come knocking, and Southern Company, which covers Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, claims that it has over 50 GW of prospective large load customers, many of which are data centers. The scale of these requests is staggering - and these just represent the utilities that have been willing to disclose their pipeline.

So what’s actually represented by 700 GW of data center inquiries? It’s actually remarkably difficult to know, because utilities hold their cards close, and data center developers hold them even closer, subjecting both utilities and local officials to non-disclosure agreements. Utilities in potentially fast-growing spaces, like Duke (NC, SC, IN, OH, and FL), TVA (TN), MidAmerican (IA), and APS (AZ) have been cagey about the inquiries they’ve received from data center developers.

Unfortunately, it is remarkably hard to nail down real data center electric demand projections from either utilities or data center developers: even top analysts aren’t clear about the size of the market, or if it will be financially viable, the folks who just build data centers aren’t sure if they’ll have takers over the long run, and utilities really just don’t know what to think.

There are a huge number of data center speculators emerging: Organizations that track data center development show a rocketing number of real estate developers working to get in on the data center action. According to data from 451 Research, there are at least 50 developers in the US looking to build significant (>50 MW) data centers that have little or no operational data centers in their portfolio. Indeed, those speculators account for nearly one-third of the data center capacity (by energy) in the database, and likely far more where they’re untracked.

Utilities tend to disclose only name-brand data center customers: While utilities may claim huge pipelines of data center customers, the fraction that they do discuss tend to be recognizable names. The hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft feature prominently, as well as wholesalers like Digital Realty, Equinix, Aligned, and QTS. The new speculators don’t tend to make the cut, and for good reason; nobody’s established a need for real estate developers to get in on the game.

Disconcertingly, speculators may be the largest fraction of the pipeline: Some utilities appear to take many of these inquiries with a grain of salt (or in some cases, a lot of salt), significantly downgrading data center customer inquiries in their load forecasts. For example, NV Energy disclosed that it only assumes 15 percent of data center customers without firm contracts will actually get online, while PacifiCorp makes no allowances without a firm contract. Other utilities appear to be more eager to see if they can get in on the action.

So what’s the big deal with a bit of good old speculation?

Well, first, we need to recall that utilities aren’t really just private enterprises, we grant them monopolies to - theoretically - attend to the common good, namely services we rely on like electricity and water. So when a utility succumbs to speculation, it’s betting with our money. And betting they are. Kentucky utility KU/LG&E is on the record pursuing nearly 2 GW of new gas, an investment of $3 billion of new gas power and retrofits to old coal plants to chase after data center customers without signed contracts; Duke Carolinas wants to install 3.6 GW of new gas, largely in the name of new data center customers; and Georgia Power is positioning itself to develop 13 GW of generation to serve new large loads in the next decade.

Second, utilities and policymakers are using the speculative rush for data centers to not only prop up fossil fuels, but roll back climate and environmental protections. President Trump has issued no less than five executive orders citing the rush for data centers as the excuse for rolling back environmental and consumer protections (example). North Carolina lawmakers overrode a veto by Governor Stein, allowing the state to roll back mandated climate targets, and Virginia may follow suit. And the three largest Regional Transmission Operators (PJM, MISO, and SPP) have new plans to fast-track gas projects – at the expense of both time and money for renewable energy projects – to meet burgeoning data center demands.

And finally, utilities are using the economic development pipeline as an excuse to skip good planning principles. Normally, we expect utilities to look out two decades or more to figure out what demand is going to look like, make sure that they can get cost-effective new generation on line, and get rid of the stuff that doesn’t make sense anymore, like old coal plants. And while many utilities are far from perfect, the last decade saw significant advances in planning sophistication, clean energy integration, and increasingly thoughtful approaches towards technologies like battery storage, grid modernization, efficiency, and demand management. But today, we’re seeing utilities issue “emergency” resource plans, fast-tracking new gas, and quietly decommit coal retirements, all in service to bring on data centers.

If we’re not careful, we may all end up paying for this expensive quest. And while Sir Frobisher simply lost his shirt, a boat, and a bit of pride, the rest of us have a lot more to lose if utilities all go chasing after that seductively sparkling pyrite.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-08/pexels-cookiecutter-1148820.jpg.webp?itok=eBn4_fkR,N,,2025-08-08 23:58:20.413451

“Thousands of Maine people stood to benefit from lower energy bills delivered by the Solar for All program,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office.
Solar can lower costs and improve reliability by reducing demand on the electrical grid, lowering wholesale energy prices and circumventing the need for costly transmission and distribution investments, the state energy office noted.
“Canceling the program deprives Maine of access to affordable solar, energy storage, and the skilled electricians, installers, and construction workers needed to meet our energy and economic needs now and in the future,” Burgess said.
When Maine received its Solar for All grant in 2024, the state had 977 megawatts of solar energy installed, an increase from the 62 megawatts that were in place five years earlier.","Maine energy officials on Friday decried the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying it will raise costs for Maine people, particularly those with lower incomes.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.

The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.

“Thousands of Maine people stood to benefit from lower energy bills delivered by the Solar for All program,” said Dan Burgess, director of the Governor’s Energy Office. “Terminating this funding doesn’t help Maine people, it only hurts them.”

In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded Maine $62 million through the federal Solar for All program that supports the state’s clean energy workforce, in addition to expanding solar to low-income households. Just last month, the EPA approved the state’s plan to implement the program so benefits could reach Mainers by 2026, according to a Friday news release from the Governor’s Energy Office.

However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on social media that the new law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.

“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

Solar for All was projected to help over 20,000 low-income Maine households save between $380 and $1,400 annually on their energy bills through incentives for rooftop solar and a new community solar and storage program.

Solar can lower costs and improve reliability by reducing demand on the electrical grid, lowering wholesale energy prices and circumventing the need for costly transmission and distribution investments, the state energy office noted. It also lessens the reliance on fossil fuels, which come with volatile price tags while exacerbating climate change.

Part of the funding was also earmarked to support workforce training for over 700 Maine residents in essential building trades including electrical work, construction, maintenance and repair.

“Canceling the program deprives Maine of access to affordable solar, energy storage, and the skilled electricians, installers, and construction workers needed to meet our energy and economic needs now and in the future,” Burgess said.

He added that the state remains committed to the program and will explore options to preserve it. His office is consulting with the Office of the Maine Attorney General on next steps.

When Maine received its Solar for All grant in 2024, the state had 977 megawatts of solar energy installed, an increase from the 62 megawatts that were in place five years earlier. The majority of solar arrays in Maine are small-scale, less than 5 megawatts.

Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.

The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asked about the program’s termination, U.S. Sen. Susan Collins told the Portland Press Herald it “would be unfortunate news,” but that underscored the risk of including such a grant program in a “completely partisan bill.”

“Not one Republican voted for the Inflation Reduction Act that included this grant program,” Collins reportedly said. “While it is no surprise now that control of the White House has changed that the new administration would consider terminating this IRA program, my staff has asked the EPA for additional information.”

The American car manufacturing giant insists that it will still follow through with its plans to create affordable access to electric vehicles.

GM will import Chinese batteries despite Trump’s tariffs

General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, is moving forward with its plans to import electric vehicle (EV) batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) to power the upcoming version of its Chevrolet Bolt.

According to sources familiar with the matter, GM will rely on CATL’s lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for around two years, while its battery manufacturing joint venture with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution prepares to begin local production of the same battery type in Tennessee by 2027.

The new generation Bolt, which General Motors plans to begin assembling at its Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas later this year, will arrive in dealerships in 2026. It will be the most affordable electric vehicle in GM’s lineup, priced at around $30,000.

Despite the 80% tariff on Chinese EV batteries, GM views the arrangement as a necessary measure to keep its pricing competitive and its production timelines on track.

“For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,” General Motors said in a statement. “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model.”

Auto maker has to handle cost pressures and tax policy

According to Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Telemetry, LFP batteries are roughly 35% cheaper to produce than nickel- and cobalt-based alternatives.

LFP battery chemistry was first developed in the U.S. in the late 1990s, but Chinese companies like CATL and BYD have since commercialized and dominated the production and supply of these batteries.

Ford, GM’s key rival, is currently licensing CATL’s LFP technology and manufacturing process for a new factory in Michigan. That facility will supply batteries for a planned small electric pickup truck.

Tesla previously used CATL’s LFP batteries in some Model 3 units until it ceased the arrangement following an escalation in U.S. tariffs earlier this year.

Currently, GM sources batteries for all 12 of its EV models, including the $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV and the $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq from U.S.-based manufacturing. None of those vehicles utilizes the cheaper LFP chemistry.

The adoption of these cost-effective batteries, coupled with other efficiencies General Motors has achieved in EV production, could allow the new Bolt to be “marginally profitable” or “close enough,” even with the tariff burden.

Adding further rationale to GM’s move, the U.S. EV tax credit policy that provided a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV purchases will be scrapped starting next month. Previously, the new Bolt would have been ineligible for the incentive due to the use of Chinese-made batteries, but with the credit now eliminated for all qualifying vehicles, GM’s Bolt will no longer be at a comparative disadvantage in the marketplace.

The Bolt was first introduced in 2016 and discontinued in 2023. The model is expected to make a comeback as part of GM’s goal to expand affordable EV options. A board member, Jon McNeill, hinted that the Bolt could be put on sale in the low $20,000s after factoring in the tax credit. With the incentive gone, the base price is expected to settle around $30,000.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Today, U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, hosted a roundtable discussion on how many jobs the Trump Administration will kill and how much they will raise New Mexicans' utility bills as a result of Trump’s Big, Bad Bill. Heinrich was joined by Western Resource Advocates, the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, the NM Renewable Energy Industries Association, Affordable Energy, Solar Works Energy, and UniRac.

Heinrich blasted Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill immediately after the text was unveiled, warning that “the impact is electricity bills will go up.”

Throughout the reconciliation process, Heinrich stood up for New Mexico families, released a report that outlined the negative economic impact of the Big, Bad Bill, grilled the U.S. Energy Secretary over Trump’s plan to gut funding for energy programs that ensure working families have access to affordable, domestic sources of energy, pushed to amend the Big, Bad Bill – for over 27 hours – by repeatedly voting to lower energy costs for families, and voted against the reconciliation bill.

“I think we're in a perfect storm that is going to hit everyday New Mexicans and people across the country, and their electric bills,” said Heinrich, Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.“And they need to know this is coming, and they need to know why it's happening.”

""This is an administration that is actively trying to destroy jobs. When you target peoples’ jobs, you really target their identity. It's the most disrespectful thing you can do,” Heinrich stated.

Heinrich continues to fight against the Big, Bad Bill and hold Donald Trump and Republicans’ accountable for raising energy costs on American families.

Recently, Heinrich grilled several pending Trump Administration nominees on the Big, Bad Bill and pressed these nominees to improve energy efficiency and develop renewable energy sources to lower utility bills.

At another Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, Heinrich raised the alarm on the energy affordability crisis facing working families and cited recent, irresponsible actions taken by the Trump Administration and Republicans that will raise energy costs – including the passage of their Big, Bad Bill, their dismantling of our nation’s clean energy industry, and a recent directive from the Department of Interior that will inevitably delay new generation additions to the grid and drive up energy costs further.",https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:57:58.828783

The program was created by the EPA in early 2024 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Approximately $7 billion was allotted to the initiative, according to a state release.

The program aims to increase the availability and accessibility of clean and affordable solar energy in homes and communities across the United States, particularly in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

It was expected that the program would cut energy bills by an estimated 20% annually for participating households in those communities, allowing people to save hundreds of dollars per year who could not otherwise access that technology.

The program was estimated to spark 200,000 new jobs nationwide and avoid 30 million metric tons of carbon emissions, but its true potential will not be realized if the EPA follows through on its plan to do away with it.

Led by Gov. Ned Lamont, several top Connecticut officials chastised the administration of President Donald Trump for leading the effort to shut down the program.

“At a time when households could benefit from transitioning to solar energy now more than ever, the Trump Administration is attempting to terminate a program that would lower energy costs for families and businesses while also delivering clean energy,” Lamont said.

The governor continued, noting that the funds belong to the taxpayers of Connecticut.

“This action by the EPA is unlawful, and we will be working with other states to counter this action,” Lamont said.

No stranger to criticizing or battling the Trump Administration, Attorney General William Tong voiced even stronger disapproval.

“Once again, Donald Trump is seizing funds intended to lower costs for American families to pay tax breaks for billionaires,” Tong said. “These funds were passed by Congress to reduce carbon pollution and to save money for low-income families getting socked right now by utility bills.”

Tong added that all legal options are being evaluated in coordination with multistate partners across the country, all aiming to protect community members and their savings accounts.

Katie Dykes, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, noted that the action by the EPA cuts off access to clean, affordable solar energy for thousands of people in the state.

She said that the program helps residents, particularly those in multi-family affordable housing, access the benefits of clean solar energy and the cost savings it brings about.

“The program would also help us improve our air quality, which is among the worst in the nation, and make our electric grid more resilient,” Dykes said. “The EPA’s action runs completely counter to our efforts to bring affordable, clean and reliable energy to Connecticut residents.”

Democratic U.S. Rep. John Larson (CT-01) said that the decision to get rid of the program that was authorized by Congress will result in higher electric bills for Connecticut residents and a less resilient power grid.

He added that it will especially affect communities such as Hartford and Portland that have benefited heavily from the program.

“At a time when we should be doing everything we can to lower costs and grow our economy, this is the absolute wrong decision. It must be reversed,” Larson said. “I am thankful for the leadership of Gov. Lamont and Attorney General Tong as they continue to explore legal options to challenge this reckless decision.”

Larson said he stands with them in the fight and that he will keep pushing back against the Trump Administration’s “attacks on hard-working families and their wallets.”

In the state release, it is noted that DEEP applied for a grant on behalf of the state through an application it submitted shortly after the program’s creation.

On April 22, 2024, the EPA informed DEEP that it secured a $62.45 million grant.

DEEP intended to use the grant to help thousands of households in Connecticut transition their homes to solar energy. A particular emphasis was going to be placed on multi-family affordable housing units.

DEEP reportedly intended to build on the success of the state’s existing programs that facilitate solar expansion and storage system deployment such as the Residential Renewable Energy Solutions program and the Energy Storage Solutions program.

Connecticut is among 60 recipients that secured grants through the program.

Now, for each of those recipients, the future is uncertain. It appears unlikely they will be able to carry out the plans with the money they were assured of last year.

Market valuation not only reflects current financial performance but also investor expectations about future growth.
Investors are acutely aware that market saturation and increased competition can significantly impact Tesla's capacity to expand its market share globally, thereby affecting overall market valuation.","Impact of Q2 2025 Earnings Misses

In Q2 2025, Tesla's earnings reports failed to meet market expectations, which resulted in not just a stock price decline but also broader concerns about the company's future profitability and market position. The reported loss in revenue and vehicle deliveries highlighted a slowdown in sales that has left investors worried about Tesla’s growth prospects. Notably, the company's failure to meet delivery targets can be linked to logistical challenges and heightened competition in the EV sector as discussed in the Daily Galaxy article. This earnings miss, coupled with financial headwinds, signifies potential difficulties for Tesla in maintaining its market dominance.

Elon Musk’s cautious guidance regarding Tesla’s future indicates a pragmatic approach to navigating current market challenges. Musk's acknowledgment of ""a few rough quarters"" ahead has sparked investor wariness, triggering concerns about Tesla’s future earnings and strategic direction. This tone of caution reflects the complex interplay between external pressures and internal execution risks that Tesla faces as it strives to maintain its valuation amidst an increasingly volatile market environment according to industry observations. Investors and market analysts remain on high alert for how Tesla plans to adjust its strategies to cope with these multifaceted challenges.

Without the allure of tax breaks reducing the immediate fiscal footprint of purchasing an electric vehicle, many potential buyers might reconsider or delay their purchase decisions. This could slow the rate of Tesla’s vehicle deliveries and impact the company's revenue stream, compounding existing financial pressures. As noted in the Daily Galaxy article, the expiration of these credits is one among several factors fueling concerns over Tesla's ability to sustain its market momentum in the face of rising costs and growing competition.

The tariffs are particularly problematic given that Tesla's vehicles rely heavily on these affected materials, meaning that even minor tariff increases can lead to substantial cost increments. For instance, batteries, a cornerstone of Tesla's product offering, have seen up to a 93% tariff increase. This has placed Tesla in a precarious financial position, where maintaining its market edge might require cost-cutting measures or innovations to compensate for these heightened expenses. According to the same source, these factors contribute to a turbulent outlook for Tesla's financial health and market standing.

Investor Sentiment and Market Valuation

Investor sentiment is a crucial factor in determining market valuation, particularly in the high-stakes realm of electric vehicles (EVs) where companies like Tesla operate. Recently, Tesla experienced a staggering $68 billion loss in market value over a mere 48-hour period. This dramatic decline emphasizes the volatility and fragility inherent in stock market valuations, where perceptions and expectations can shift rapidly. Analysts suggest that macroeconomic factors, such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits and new tariffs on essential raw materials, have compounded investor unease and contributed to this precipitous drop.

Market valuation not only reflects current financial performance but also investor expectations about future growth. Tesla's high valuation multiples, with a forward P/E ratio over 200, suggest that the market had previously priced in a high level of future growth. However, as competition intensifies and economic pressures mount, such expectations may have to be adjusted. The adjustment in Tesla’s stock price, therefore, reflects a recalibration of investor expectations surrounding its long-term market position and potential to maintain its leadership in the EV sector.

The broader EV market's weakening conditions are an undeniable factor influencing investor sentiment about Tesla. Softening sales in major markets, including Europe and China, as reported by sources discussed in the article, have exacerbated anxieties about Tesla sustaining its rapid growth historically. Investors are acutely aware that market saturation and increased competition can significantly impact Tesla's capacity to expand its market share globally, thereby affecting overall market valuation.

Broader Market Conditions Affecting Tesla

Tesla's recent financial upheaval, marked by a stark $68 billion loss in market value over merely 48 hours, has sparked concerns about the broader market conditions impacting the company. According to The Daily Galaxy, this loss reflects deeper financial and operational challenges, including disappointing earnings and vehicle delivery numbers that fell short of expectations. The confluence of these elements projects a cloudy outlook for Tesla's short-term market trajectory.

Investor sentiment towards Tesla has also been impacted by CEO Elon Musk's cautious forward-looking statements. As noted in the analysis, Musk's indication of ""a few rough quarters ahead"" has only amplified fears regarding Tesla's capacity to sustain its market position amidst growing competition. Moreover, with Tesla's high valuation multiples and slowing growth, the market is beginning to question the sustainability of its stock prices.

The slowdown in EV sales across major markets, including Europe and China, not only affects Tesla but indicates broader market trends that could challenge the entire sector. Analysts from 24/7 Wall St. suggest that these macroeconomic factors, coupled with Tesla's internal challenges, paint a complex picture of its future market share and profitability. As Tesla navigates these turbulent waters, strategic adaptations will be crucial to maintaining its competitive edge in an evolving market landscape.

Moreover, Tesla's valuation has been a topic of debate among analysts, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio often lying substantially above traditional benchmarks. Such high valuations rest on expectations of continued rapid growth and innovation which, if unmet, can swiftly lead to downward corrections as seen recently. The mounting global challenges Tesla faces—including a slowdown in the electric vehicle market growth across regions like Europe and China—place immense pressure on the company to meet analyst forecasts and maintain investor trust. These challenges, coupled with CEO Elon Musk's public pronouncements, which occasionally mix calculated optimism with candid uncertainty about future hurdles, can sway investor sentiment dramatically and contribute further to stock volatility according to analysts. The interplay of these factors creates an unpredictable environment in which Tesla's stock operates, maintaining its reputation as one of the most volatile stocks on the market.

Future Prospects for Tesla and Elon Musk's Leadership

The future prospects for Tesla and the leadership of Elon Musk appear to be at a pivotal juncture as the company navigates through a series of financial and industrial challenges. According to recent reports, Tesla experienced a staggering $68 billion market value loss over a mere 48 hours, which has set off alarms regarding the sustainability of its market dominance. This significant depreciation in value is attributed to a mix of disappointing Q2 earnings results, looming expiration of federal EV tax incentives, and increasing production costs due to tariffs on key materials.",https://opentools.ai/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-09 13:03:23.548742

While incentives for electric two- and three-wheelers will end in March 2026, larger commercial vehicles like buses and trucks will continue to receive support.

The central government has decided to extend its flagship electric mobility initiative, the PM E-Drive scheme, by two more years. The programme, which was originally set to conclude in March 2026, will now run until March 31, 2028, or until its Rs 10,900 crore outlay is fully utilised. Launched in October 2024, the PM E-Drive scheme replaced the earlier Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme and was designed to support the adoption of electric vehicles by offering buyer incentives, boosting localisation of EV components, and expanding the country’s charging and testing infrastructure.

No extension for electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers

Despite the extension, subsidies for electric two- and three-wheelers will still end as originally scheduled on March 31, 2026. These categories are currently eligible for incentives of Rs 5,000 per kWh in FY2025, which will drop to Rs 2,500 per kWh in FY2026, with a cap of 15% of the vehicle's ex-factory price.

Meanwhile, larger commercial segments - including electric buses, trucks, and ambulances - will continue receiving financial support until March 2028. These vehicle types form a critical part of the government’s plan to electrify public transport and reduce urban pollution. Ayush Lohia, CEO, YOUDHA said “The strong traction we’re seeing in the L-5 category highlights the immense potential of cargo electric 3-wheelers. With the PM E-DRIVE incentives Rs 50,000 in year one, Rs 25,000 in year two,buyers are empowered to adopt cleaner vehicles, and OEMs are motivated to scale up production rapidly.”

While near-term earnings volatility and sector-specific headwinds may test investor patience, the company's long-term trajectory is underpinned by a robust pipeline of projects, extended tax incentives, and a vertically integrated business model that positions it to dominate the low-carbon energy transition.

Policy Tailwinds: A New Era for RNG

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) in July 2025 marked a watershed moment for Opal Fuels. By extending the 45Z production tax credit through 2029, the legislation provides a critical financial lifeline for RNG producers. This extension not only stabilizes revenue streams but also de-risks capital-intensive projects like Opal's Atlantic, Burlington, and Kirby RNG facilities, which are scheduled to come online in 2025–2027.

The OBBB also harmonizes RNG incentives with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enabling Opal to monetize Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and streamline project financing. For context, Opal sold $16.7 million in IRA-related tax credits in 2025, a move that enhanced liquidity while accelerating project timelines. This policy clarity contrasts sharply with the regulatory uncertainty that plagued the sector in 2024, when volatile RIN prices and delayed LCFS credit approvals stifled growth.

Strategic Execution: Scaling a Vertically Integrated Model

Opal's vertically integrated approach—controlling RNG production, upgrading, and distribution—creates a moat against competitors reliant on fragmented supply chains. The company's Q2 2025 results underscore this advantage: RNG production rose 33% year-over-year to 1.2 million MMBtu, while RNG dispensed as transportation fuel hit 20.6 million GGEs, a 10% increase. These gains were driven by 46 fueling stations under construction, 20 of which are owned by Opal, ensuring margin protection and customer retention.

The company's project pipeline further highlights its execution prowess. The Atlantic RNG project, set to begin operations in Q3 2025, will add 0.3 million MMBtu annually to Opal's 50% ownership share. Meanwhile, the Burlington and Cottonwood projects (1.1 million MMBtu combined) and the Kirby RNG project (0.7 million MMBtu) are scheduled for 2026 and 2027, respectively. These projects are expected to boost RNG production by 30–40% over the next three years, aligning with the sector's projected CAGR of 11.7% through 2030.

Navigating Near-Term Challenges

Despite its strengths, Opal faces near-term hurdles. Construction delays at the Hilltop and Vander Schaaf dairy projects in California—stemming from disputes with an EPC contractor—have pushed timelines back by 6–12 months. While these setbacks temporarily reduced capital efficiency, they are not insurmountable. Opal's $203.2 million liquidity position, including $138.4 million in unused credit facility capacity, provides ample flexibility to fund operations and absorb delays.

Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2025 dipped to $16.5 million from $21.1 million in Q2 2024, reflecting higher project costs and lower RNG margins in Q1. However, this decline is a temporary blip. The company's full-year 2025 guidance remains intact, and the ramp-up of new projects in 2026 is expected to restore EBITDA growth to 15–20% annually.

Competitive Positioning in a Fragmented Market

Opal's vertically integrated model differentiates it from peers like Clean Energy Fuels and Vanguard Renewables, which rely on third-party infrastructure. By controlling the entire value chain, Opal minimizes exposure to pipeline bottlenecks and ensures consistent margins. This is particularly critical as the RNG market matures and competition intensifies.

The company's focus on transportation fuel also positions it to capture a growing share of the $26.5 billion RNG market by 2030. Heavy-duty fleets, which account for 60% of RNG demand, are increasingly adopting RNG to meet decarbonization targets. Opal's 51% RNG share in its Fuel Station Services segment (40.8 million GGEs in Q2 2025) demonstrates its ability to meet this demand profitably.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Play on Decarbonization

While Opal's stock may face short-term volatility due to project delays and sector-wide policy debates (e.g., natural gas bans in 100+ U.S. jurisdictions), the company's long-term fundamentals are compelling. Key catalysts include:

1. Policy Stability: The OBBB and IRA create a predictable regulatory environment for RNG.

2. Scalable Projects: $33.4 million in 2025 capital expenditures will unlock 2.3 million MMBtu of new capacity by 2027.

3. Margin Resilience: Vertical integration and tax credit monetization insulate Opal from commodity price swings.

For investors with a 5–7 year horizon, Opal Fuels represents a high-conviction play on the RNG sector's transition from niche to mainstream. While near-term earnings misses may test patience, the company's strategic execution, policy tailwinds, and operational scale make it a standout in a market poised for explosive growth.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-09 05:59:23.238783

We analyzed August car market data to find the EVs with the lowest and highest market day supply (MDS). MDS measures how many days it would take to sell through current inventory at the current sales pace. Here are the standouts in today’s EV market.

Top 10: The Fastest-Selling EVs Right Now

These are the EVs with the lowest market day supply as of August 2025. That means they’re in high demand right now, and likely harder to negotiate on due to limited availability.

Toyota’s bZ4X tops the list this month at just 32 days of supply, showing that Toyota loyalists will consider an EV with the Toyota badge. This is intriguing since Toyota has been kicking its EV transition down the road for as long as it could. The 2026 Toyota bZ will replace the bZ4X in name, and will look a lot better in our opinion.

Nissan scored a rare double appearance with both the LEAF and Ariya selling quickly. But don’t let Nissan’s EV sales rate fool you: they’re still selling electric models in much lower volumes than Chevrolet, Hyundai, Ford, and obviously Tesla.

Mercedes-Benz and Chevrolet also have two models each in the top 10. The Chevy Equinox EV is the best-selling electric car outside of Tesla right now, at least in terms of total sold.

Bottom 10: The Slowest-Selling EVs in 2025

These EVs have the highest MDS, meaning they’re sitting unsold for far longer than average. Buyers may be able to score bigger discounts on these models — especially with CarEdge’s AI Negotiator doing the legwork for you.

Cadillac’s Escalade IQ is the slowest-selling EV in America right now, with an eye-popping 254 days of supply. Luxury EVs dominate the slowest sellers, including the Porsche Taycan, Audi Q6 e-tron. The Ford Mustang Mach-E also finds itself here again, with nearly 8 months of supply on dealer lots despite big incentives. For buyers, these numbers point to opportunities, but only if you know how to negotiate.

What This Means for EV Shoppers

If you’re chasing a deal, start your search with the slowest sellers. High inventory levels give you leverage, and dealers will be more motivated to talk price. Always check the latest EV incentives.

In August and September, expect an EV buying frenzy for any models that qualify for the new and used EV tax credits. Those incentives are going to expire on September 30, 2025.

“If you’re shopping for a slow-selling EV, you have more negotiating power than you might think,” says auto industry veteran Ray Shefska. “But with the federal tax credits ending September 30, you can combine dealer discounts with a major incentive — that’s a rare opportunity to save big.”

This gives rise to a burning question: How do governments and businesses across the world benefit from China's advancement in clean energy?
There is now a major opportunity to deconcentrate clean energy supply chains, which will attract more investments, make them more resilient and strengthen economic security.
Moreover, global partnerships are needed to strengthen environmental and social safeguards in clean energy goods trade.
Africa currently accounts for just 2 percent of the global investment in clean energy, with countries like Nigeria witnessing a significant increase in imports of clean energy tools from China over the past few years, albeit the increase is on a low base.","China and the rest of the world have been presented with an enormous economic opportunity by the United States' so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act. US tariffs have already increased the costs of many imported low-carbon goods in the US. Now, the new act, signed into law on US Independence Day on July 4, will further harm the market for many clean energy goods by removing tax credits, most likely leading to greater dependence on fossil fuels and increased damage to the climate.

This will create more challenges for clean energy producers and consumers in the US, likely affecting exporters, particularly those that export their products.

But more interestingly, the new act is likely to put China further ahead of the US in the global race to capitalize on the rapidly growing market for clean energy technologies. Strategically, the task ahead is to identify how this shift can be used to triple the production of renewable energy the world needs by 2030, one of the key climate goals we need to achieve this decade.

China and the US are the biggest investors in large-scale electricity storage, with the two sides, along with Europe, accounting for more than 90 percent of global spending on electricity storage. But the new act may signal a cooling off for electricity storage companies in the US, giving China a decisive edge in the field.

Any reduction in the export of clean energy technologies from China to the US is likely to be offset by the increase in exports to other countries. China already exports more solar photovoltaic panels to developing countries than to advanced economies.

Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, too, are looking at international markets, where they can offer a clean, competitive alternative to cars powered by gasoline. Chinese EV and battery manufacturers have announced they would invest huge amounts to establish and expand their manufacturing capacities in major foreign markets, including Indonesia, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico and Turkiye.

Besides, more than 17 million EVs were sold worldwide last year, meaning more than one in every five new vehicles sold worldwide was an EV. China accounts for more than 70 percent of the global EV production, primarily meeting the demand at home. Also, the global market for EVs increased by 20 percent last year, with China exporting almost 1.25 million EVs, or about 40 percent of the global total, in 2024.

The production of solar panels in China reached a record high in March 2025. Measured by value, 44 percent of Chinese-made solar panel exports were destined for emerging market economies and developing countries in 2023. Many emerging market economies and developing countries imported record levels of Chinese solar power technology in 2024.

This gives rise to a burning question: How do governments and businesses across the world benefit from China's advancement in clean energy?

This is an acute issue for strategic sectors, from EVs to renewables. To resolve it, a new generation of joint ventures is needed, joint ventures that are mutually beneficial to manufacturers in China and those across Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.

There is now a major opportunity to deconcentrate clean energy supply chains, which will attract more investments, make them more resilient and strengthen economic security.

Moreover, global partnerships are needed to strengthen environmental and social safeguards in clean energy goods trade. In this regard, the Solar Stewardship Initiative, which has several leading Chinese producers as members, recently released a list of comprehensive standards to address environmental, social and governance issues.

Furthermore, the huge decline in the prices of Chinese-made solar panels and wind turbines since 2022 could especially benefit African countries. Africa currently accounts for just 2 percent of the global investment in clean energy, with countries like Nigeria witnessing a significant increase in imports of clean energy tools from China over the past few years, albeit the increase is on a low base.

As the world looks forward to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Belém, Brazil, in November, a major challenge the international community faces is to show how China's leading position in the global clean energy market can contribute to Africa's green industrialization, and create new jobs and business opportunities across the globe.

Indeed, the spectacular growth of the global clean energy technology market because of China's massive investments in the sector can help erase the gloom arising from the abandonment of climate leadership by the US.

In the first half of the year, global EV sales for the entire automotive conglomerate rose 47 percent to about 465,000 units, giving the company an 11-percent share of the global market. However, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. According to a new report, one all-electric model is facing retirement.

Autocar alleges the ID.5 will be dropped from the lineup as early as 2027, giving the swoopy electric SUV a seven-year life cycle with no second-generation model planned. Sluggish sales are reportedly to blame as the model failed to gain traction in Europe. Instead, buyers prefer the more spacious, conventionally styled ID.4. Not launching the ID.5 in the United States further limited its potential.

Ironically, the ID.5 actually tops the VW Group’s EV sales charts for the first half of the year, but only because its numbers are combined with those of the ID.4. As expected, the regular model did most of the heavy lifting, contributing the bulk of the 84,900 units sold through June. The ID.3 followed with 60,700 units, trailed by the Audi Q4 E-Tron and Q4 E-Tron Sportback at 44,600 units.

Cutting the ID.5 raises questions about the fate of its Ford equivalent, the Capri. The Blue Oval revived the iconic nameplate on its own coupe-styled electric crossover last year, but production was soon reduced. The early cutback came in response to “rapidly deteriorating market conditions for electric vehicles,” according to a Ford spokesperson quoted by German newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger.

The ID.5’s demise is said to be part of a broader effort to cull underperforming models. VW has already retired the Passat sedan, recently ended Arteon production, and is rumored to drop the Touareg in 2026. Its only convertible, the T-Roc Cabriolet, will bow out in 2027. Plans for a smaller ID. Buzz minivan to replace the aging Touran have also been scrapped.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/gZpG7/s1/2022-volkswagen-id.5.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:03:09.089185

According to a press release, the upgrades will allow the facility to produce lithium-iron phosphate battery cells by 2027.
GM hopes that it will help create a zero-emissions, all-electric-motoring future by making affordable batteries for EVs.
By creating low-cost batteries, GM will make it easier for everyday people to invest in EVs.
While the Ultium facility upgrade won't be immediate, the company will continue investing in people and our environment.","General Motors will upgrade Ultium Cells LLC's Spring Hill, Tennessee, battery cell manufacturing facility.

According to a press release, the upgrades will allow the facility to produce lithium-iron phosphate battery cells by 2027.

This is incredible news for anyone looking to purchase an electric vehicle in the relatively near future.

Ultium is a collaboration between General Motors and LG Energy Solutions. GM hopes that it will help create a zero-emissions, all-electric-motoring future by making affordable batteries for EVs.

""This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio,"" said Kurt Kelty, VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM.

By creating low-cost batteries, GM will make it easier for everyday people to invest in EVs.

EV costs are falling as battery prices become more affordable. While batteries can contribute to EVs being more expensive than gas cars, the former ultimately cost less to operate.

The Natural Resources Defense Council noted that electricity prices are usually more stable than gas prices. In a 2018 study, The University of Michigan said that EVs cost $485 a year to operate on average. In comparison, gas-powered cars cost $1,117.

EVs also pollute less than gas-powered cars. Per the U.S. Department of Energy, a gas-powered car puts 12,594 pounds of CO2 in the air annually. EVs are responsible for 2,551 pounds of CO2 per year, mostly because of charging batteries using grid-provided electricity that's heavily reliant on dirty fuels.

It is possible to reduce this number if you have an EV by doing a couple of things. For example, you can cut pollution and reduce charging costs by installing solar panels on your home and charging your car there. EnergySage can help you find the right installer.

While the Ultium facility upgrade won't be immediate, the company will continue investing in people and our environment. The Spring Hill location employs 1,300 people, and its focus on affordability will make it easier for everyone to be a part of a cleaner, greener future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ultium-Cells-LLCimage-recuXzs5QVLfXsahl.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:05:42.039511
,Louisiana and Evs,2025-08-09 00:41:01+00:00,The Cool Down,Tesla reaches settlement in lawsuit alleging 'existential threat' to its business - The Cool Down,Nicole Westhoff,,,,,https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/tesla-louisiana-lawsuit-direct-sales/,"Tesla just settled a major lawsuit over direct sales — and the outcome could open doors for electric vehicle manufacturers in other states.

Tesla argued that the law, which restricted sales to franchised dealerships, posed an ""existential threat"" to its business model.
Court documents confirm that Tesla and Louisiana have ""fully and finally resolved"" the case.
Direct sales can allow manufacturers to offer transparent pricing, simpler ordering, and more consistent service.","Tesla just settled a major lawsuit over direct sales — and the outcome could open doors for electric vehicle manufacturers in other states.

The automaker has settled a 2022 lawsuit against the state of Louisiana over its ban on direct-to-consumer vehicle sales, according to Drive Tesla Canada.

Tesla argued that the law, which restricted sales to franchised dealerships, posed an ""existential threat"" to its business model. Court documents confirm that Tesla and Louisiana have ""fully and finally resolved"" the case. However, the settlement terms remain undisclosed.

This move could affect more than just Tesla. EV makers have long claimed that dealership laws limit access, raise prices, and slow the adoption of cleaner transportation. Direct sales can allow manufacturers to offer transparent pricing, simpler ordering, and more consistent service.

Although the resolution doesn't clarify whether Tesla can now sell directly in Louisiana, it may signal growing pressure on states to revisit dealer protections that many consumers see as outdated. More than a dozen states still ban or heavily restrict direct sales, even as demand for EVs grows, according to a 2024 report from Easy Auto Ship.

Tesla's legal win comes amid a challenging year for the company as sales slumped globally during the first and second quarters. Still, Tesla continues to push innovation — like battery upgrades and energy products — that could improve vehicle range and grid reliability, even as sustainability experts raise concerns about supply chain impacts.

The settlement also helps explain why Tesla sightings have been rare in certain areas.

""Okay… Now I understand why there were so few Teslas when I was in New Orleans in 2023,"" one user posted on X. Other users welcomed the development, with one commenting, ""This settlement is a positive step forward for Tesla and customers in Louisiana,"" and another adding: ""Interesting move—wonder if this opens the door for other states to follow.""

For anyone curious about making the switch to an EV to help the planet and save on energy and maintenance, it's worth taking a closer look at what's available for your budget.

Looking to save even more? Installing solar panels can also dramatically increase the cost savings of owning an EV, since charging with solar energy is cheaper than using public stations or the grid. EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installation.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tesla-Louisianaimage-rec93gPbQgowZSS6d.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:05:46.341822

For some permits, all that would have been required is a simple declaration of the company's environmental commitment.

Lula instead reinstated the current strict licensing rules for strategic projects, such as a controversial oil mega-project at the mouth of the Amazon river, but set a one-year deadline for them to be approved or rejected.

His veto also ensures that several Indigenous territories and the Atlantic Forest, which stretches along the east coast, will continue to enjoy special protection, Environment Minister Marina Silva told reporters.

SOS Atlantic Forest, a non-governmental organization that had garnered over a million signatures calling for a veto of the law, hailed Lula's decision as ""a victory"" for environmental protection.

Greenpeace also praised the leftist president's action on the issue.

But the executive coordinator of APIB, Brazil's largest Indigenous rights group, told AFP he was disappointed that the president had not struck down the entire bill.

Lula's veto must now be ratified by Congress, which is dominated by conservatives.

Lula's environmental credentials are under close scrutiny in the run-up to the annual UN climate summit, which he will host in November in the Amazon city of Belem.

While seeking to take a leadership role on climate change on the global stage, Lula has faced criticism at home for backing drilling in the Equatorial Margin, along the country's northern coast.

He argues that the revenue from the oil field is necessary to finance Brazil's energy transition.

Silva said Lula's objective was to ensure that ""the economy does not compete with ecology, but rather they are part of the same equation.""

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Stories from the INN Network (@inn_network) What’s next for rural clean energy coverage By broadening story content and targeting audiences likely to benefit from rural clean energy, “Powering Rural Futures” laid the groundwork for accurate, inclusive coverage of this growing workforce.","The five-part collaborative series “Powering Rural Futures” revealed that students, educators and employers across the country have an expansive definition of a ‘clean energy job.’ With funding and editorial support made possible by the Ascendium Education Group, this collaboration allowed newsrooms to show up and build trust with often-overlooked rural residents and added greater diversity and nuance to their coverage of higher education and energy issues.

Amid shifting federal policy and funding uncertainties, journalists from across INN’s Rural News Network identified a shared goal: spotlighting the training programs preparing rural communities for clean energy jobs, and the students, educators and local leaders driving that transformation.

The reporting reached a wide audience through republication and multimedia engagement, including vertical video — advancing RNN’s mission to reflect the complexity, resilience and innovation within rural America.

An editorial scope that broadened understanding

As reporters from Canary Media, South Dakota News Watch, Cardinal News, The Mendocino Voice and The Maine Monitor headed out to rural communities in central Illinois, eastern South Dakota, southwestern Virginia, northern California and central Maine, they discovered that students, educators and employers across the country have an expansive definition of a ‘clean energy job.’

They found resilient communities adapting to growing workforce needs that sometimes require that they think outside the box. In South Dakota, a technician who traveled the country for a job wiring wind towers found his next career move was becoming a wind energy program instructor at the technical college where he trained. In Wise County, Virginia, high schools are investing in building a pipeline for their students to enter energy technology programs after learning to install solar panels during summer break. In Somerset County, Maine, training to install heat pumps is being added to programs for future HVAC technicians.

The reporting challenges the narrow way mainstream discourse often characterizes clean energy jobs, which overlooks the diverse and rural workers already doing them. By broadening that picture, it encourages more investment in training a rural clean energy workforce. In California, a community college trains construction students who could supply the labor for a utility company to build a geothermal plant. In Illinois, a state-sponsored training program operates inside a local EV factory.

By teaming up with Big Local News at Stanford, the collaboration used a shared dataset to map clean energy jobs by county —connecting stories across five states and uncovering local and state investments often missed in broader coverage.

Cardinal News Editor Jeff Schwaner said Southwest Virginia is often misrepresented or overlooked in national coverage. Their reporting, set in the heart of coal country, highlighted resilience and innovation, helping correct tired stereotypes of a region seen only as struggling. Because the team had covered rural higher education in a past collaboration, they were able to go even deeper this time around.

Newsroom growth that reflects communities

With support from the collaboration, reporters were able to dig deeper into rural communities and uncover stories that would have been difficult to reach otherwise. In South Dakota, Bart Pfankuch reported from towns like Mitchell and Watertown, strengthening South Dakota News Watch’s presence outside major cities. Their article was the top story on the site the week it published.

“Stories like this demonstrate we know what’s going on outside the cities,” said Carson Walker, Pfankuch’s editor and CEO of South Dakota News Watch.

In Maine, The Monitor used the opportunity to send new reporter Kristian Moravec into rural areas to build trust and experience. She spoke with sources ranging from their 20s to their 70s, many of whom weren’t used to speaking with journalists. That groundwork helped inform not only the workforce story, but future reporting on education in small towns.

Both newsrooms came away with a clearer understanding of the people shaping the clean energy transition and a stronger connection with the communities they serve.

Reaching for community response

Newsrooms intentionally sought out new audiences, highlighting the voices of Hispanic, Native and low-income workers.

The stories sparked local enthusiasm, too. In South Dakota, coverage of wind energy jobs created an opening to better inform residents about careers in the industry. In Maine, The Monitor’s story outlined the state’s path to 30,000 clean energy jobs by 2030, offering practical entry points for residents curious about joining the workforce.

Multimedia helped expand the reach. All five newsrooms produced vertical videos for INN’s Instagram account, experimenting with new ways to engage. Cardinal News’s video on high school solar training drew more than 4,500 Facebook views and strong engagement on TikTok and Instagram. The Maine Monitor’s Reddit video earned 14,000 views, with additional reach on Instagram and local TV.

For others, the format was new but promising. The Mendocino Voice’s reel brought in over 2,000 views, while Canary Media’s editor said the process sparked fresh ideas for promotion. South Dakota News Watch broke a personal record with 150 views on its first-ever video.

Reporters further shared their findings on at least half a dozen local TV stations, radio shows and podcasts. Statewide and national partners, republished several articles (see below).

What’s next for rural clean energy coverage

By broadening story content and targeting audiences likely to benefit from rural clean energy, “Powering Rural Futures” laid the groundwork for accurate, inclusive coverage of this growing workforce.

Even Canary Media, a longtime expert in clean energy industries, benefited from new perspectives featured in the series, which it co-published on its website. Series editor Dan Haugen said “These were stories and people who probably would not have been featured in our coverage otherwise.” By moving beyond industry insiders to profile students, blue-collar workers and formerly incarcerated people, “this broke out of that sourcing bubble in a big way that wouldn’t have happened otherwise.”

The journalists’ wide range of sources and thoughtful reporting have already sparked follow-up ideas and reader questions, including concerns about housing geothermal workers, recycling wind turbines and the stability of state-funded training programs.

With awareness growing around these educational opportunities and an emerging clean energy workforce, key questions remain about which promises will be fulfilled in rural America – and RNN newsrooms are preparing to dig into those answers in a second round of reporting this fall.

Brazil's lower house approved the legislation by 267-116 in July, dealing a big blow to Lula after several moderates had sided with Brazil's opposition.
One of Lula's vetoes also addresses protection of another endangered area, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, which is the focus of the work of Ribeiro's group.","SAO PAULO -- Brazil’s president vetoed Friday parts of a congressional bill that sought to overhaul the country’s environmental licensing rules — legislation pushed by the right-wing opposition but which environmentalists say would impede efforts to protect sensitive areas such as the Amazon rainforest.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva threw out 63 out of the controversial bill's 400 measures, the government said, though the significance of the vetoes will be clearer once the bill is published in the official gazette and goes into effect.

Lula's supporters and environmentalists had dubbed the legislation “Devastation Bill,” while allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro, held in house arrest on charges linked to an alleged coup plot, had pushed for its approval in congress.

Critics had argued that the bill undermines safeguards and harms Brazil’s credibility ahead of hosting U.N. climate talks in November.

Environment protection groups welcomed Lula’s vetoes — though congress can still take steps to override them and introduce additional legislation.

Several government ministers, speaking at a news conference at the presidential palace, lauded Lula's changes, saying he threw out parts of the legislation that would allow for fast-tracking of projects in the Amazon and curtailed the authority of federal agencies in issuing licenses for projects.

Only enterprises of “low polluting potential” will be allowed to get that kind of fast track, the ministers said.

It was not immediately clear if Lula had vetoed a measure on upgrading existing roads without oversight, which could allow the paving of the entire highway running about 900 kilometers (560 miles) through the western Amazon.

Lula doesn’t have the majority in Brazil’s congress, where Bolsonaro allies often side with moderates to pass conservative legislation.

“We understand we are keeping a dialogue with congress and assuring that there is integrity in environmental licensing,” Environment Minister Marina Silva said.

“This is fundamental for the protection of the environment in a context of climate crisis, loss of biodiversity and desertification processes,” she added.

Lula had already spoken about possibly vetoing parts of the bill after it passed in congress last month. Brazil's lower house approved the legislation by 267-116 in July, dealing a big blow to Lula after several moderates had sided with Brazil's opposition.

The 79-year-old leftist Lula — who was facing higher unpopularity, growing opposition in congress and increasing risks to his likely reelection bid — saw his polls improve days later, after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.

Trump, an ally of Bolsonaro, had linked the tariffs to Bolsonaro’s trial, which he called a “witch hunt” and demanded an end to the proceedings.

Miriam Belchior, an official with Brazil's chief of staff, said Lula's vetoes will safeguard the “rights of Indigenous peoples and communities of descendants of slaves, and incorporate mechanisms to make licensing quicker, but without harming” Brazil's natural resources.

“This is a victory for the society,” said Malu Ribeiro, head of the SOS Atlantica nonprofit organization.

One of Lula's vetoes also addresses protection of another endangered area, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, which is the focus of the work of Ribeiro's group. Without the vetoes, she said there would have been much harm to efforts of ""everyone who defends this national treasure.”

DENVER — The Colorado Energy Office has awarded $5 million in state-funded grants to expand the state’s electric vehicle charging network with 56 new fast charger ports at nine sites.

In Brief:

$5 million in state grants awarded for EV charging

56 new fast charger ports planned at nine locations

Projects prioritized in impacted communities

Goal to support 940,000 EVs on Colorado roads by 2030

The grants, part of the Direct-Current Fast-Charging Plazas program, will increase Colorado’s public fast-charger network of more than 1,400 ports by about 4%. This is the seventh round of awards since the program began.

Gov. Jared Polis said the investment will help make electric vehicles more accessible and affordable for residents and visitors traveling across the state. He criticized the Trump administration for policies he said raise costs and slow the market-driven transition to electric vehicles, adding that Colorado remains committed to leading the shift and saving consumers money.

CEO Executive Director Will Toor said the transition to EVs reduces costs, improves air quality, and supports the state’s greenhouse gas reduction goals. He said the state is working toward its goal of having 940,000 light-duty EVs on the road by 2030 despite federal challenges.

With federal funding on pause, the latest grants use state dollars to support projects in Fairplay, Ridgway, Mancos, Commerce City, Denver, Woodland Park, Naturita and Glendale. Many of the chargers are expected to be available in 2026 and 2027.

The program currently has 13 completed sites in the Front Range, Eastern Plains and Western Slope, including Montrose, Frisco, Pueblo, Cortez, Longmont, Seibert, and Limon. As in previous rounds, projects in disproportionately impacted communities were prioritized to deliver air quality benefits to areas most affected by transportation-related pollution.

This round’s grant recipients are Helios Charging, eCAMION USA Inc., Electric Era Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc.

More details on the program and awards are available on the DCFC Plazas webpage.

The decision halts $156 million in Michigan projects, some of which were already in development.
The program, created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, awarded 60 grants to states, tribes, territories and nonprofits to fund rooftop and community solar projects.
“The EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.
The Environmental Protection Network, an organization of former EPA staff, said in a statement that the decision could cost nearly one million households about $400 each per year in higher electricity bills.","The Environmental Protection Agency has terminated the $7 billion Solar for All program, a Biden-era initiative intended to bring solar power to nearly one million low-income households across the country. The decision halts $156 million in Michigan projects, some of which were already in development.

The program, created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, awarded 60 grants to states, tribes, territories and nonprofits to fund rooftop and community solar projects.

In Michigan, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy planned to use the funds to deliver at least a 20 percent reduction in electricity costs for participating households, a requirement in the EPA’s program guidelines

EGLE’s Solar for Savings pilot program, funded through Solar for All, awarded about $7.9 million to eight projects earlier this summer, including:

North End Woodward Community Coalition (Wayne County): Expand its “Solar Neighbors” initiative with a community trust-owned solar design.

Hope Village Revitalization (Wayne County): Retrofit 10 homes in Detroit and Highland Park with rooftop solar, battery storage, weatherization and high-efficiency heat pumps, with plans to scale to 100 homes.

MiSide Housing (Oakland County): Install rooftop solar on a 60-unit multifamily building for low-income seniors, with savings funding a resident service coordinator.

Superior Watershed Partnership (Chippewa County): Equip 15 low-income homes with solar—at least five with storage—prioritizing critical-care customers.

City of Benton Harbor (Berrien County): Install solar on city facilities, with credits applied to low-income residents’ water bills.

Hillsdale Board of Public Utilities (Hillsdale County): Build a ground-mounted solar array with pollinator-friendly landscaping, providing bill credits to low-income customers.

Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan (Chippewa County): Install solar and storage on 12 homes and a community building.

Lowell Light & Power (Kent County): Add solar canopies at a park, with bill benefits and community education.

The full $156 million allocation to Michigan was expected to support similar projects statewide.

Nationally, the EPA projected Solar for All would create about 200,000 jobs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 million metric tons, and save low-income households more than $350 million annually on electricity bills.

The Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the program would have saved participants more than $400 million per year for 20 to 30 years in a social media statement.

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded had been spent before the program’s termination, according to a tally by Atlas Public Policy. Several projects nationwide were still in planning phases.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency no longer has the authority to administer the program after the repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the “Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump last month. Zeldin called Solar for All a “boondoggle” and said canceling it would “save U.S. taxpayers another $7 billion.”

Critics dispute that interpretation, saying the repeal does not apply retroactively to grants already awarded.

“The EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress,” said Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association.

The Environmental Protection Network, an organization of former EPA staff, said in a statement that the decision could cost nearly one million households about $400 each per year in higher electricity bills. Legal challenges are expected, with the Southern Environmental Law Center warning, “We will see them in court.”

In April, a federal judge ruled the EPA could not freeze existing Solar for All contracts.

The Michigan League for Conservation Voters, in a written statement, said rescinding the grants wastes taxpayer money and delays affordable clean energy projects that were designed to make it “easier for low-mid income households, rural residents, and BIPOC communities that have long been left out of the equation to reap the benefits of solar energy.”

One example includes the city of Kalamazoo’s early-stage community solar work, which was projected to save families hundreds on their bills every year.

“By revoking the grants now, the Trump administration is pulling the rug out from under these projects and communities,” the statement said, “wasting taxpayer dollars, and stalling momentum toward a more affordable, equitable energy future.”

Bristow flies BETA's ALIA CX300 conventional take-off and landing (eCTOL) aircraft in first of a months-long series of market survey operations

Delivery of BETA's aircraft to the Test Arena concludes a 6976 km journey across seven countries in the EU; marks company's first operations with a BETA-trained customer pilot

STAVANGER, Norway, Aug. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bristow Norway AS, a subsidiary of Bristow Group Inc., today flew BETA Technologies' all-electric ALIA CX300 aircraft at Stavanger Airport, marking the first operations of Norway's Test Arena for Zero & Low Emission Aviation. The flights, which are being conducted in cooperation with Avinor and the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway (CAA Norway), mark a step toward integrating and scaling Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) in Norway and the surrounding regions.

The Test Arena will consist of a series of evaluation flights over the next several months, to test likely customer routes at Avinor-owned airports throughout Norway. Early routes will see ALIA fly between Stavanger and Bergen airports, with potential for the program to expand to additional routes across Norway later this year. The aircraft will be flown by BETA-trained Bristow pilots.

Today's flight was conducted by Bristow pilot, Jeremy Degagne, and Beta pilot, Nate Dubie. In addition to kicking off Norway's first Test Arena, this flight represents another key step on the road to commercializing AAM. A BETA-trained Bristow crew will pilot and maintain BETA's aircraft throughout the six-month regulatory sandbox evaluation project helping pave the way for future delivery and integration of this technology into the region.

""As a nation wholly dependent on aviation — today as well as in the future — transitioning to a more sustainable aviation industry is a major priority for my government,"" said Minister of Transport Jon-Ivar Nygård.

""This first flight represents a significant step on a long and complex journey. As the Test Arena demonstrates, cooperation between authorities, airports, manufacturers, operators — and not least, political support — is essential. The systemic approach the Test Arena facilitates is unique, and I am proud that Norway is at the forefront.""

""Today's test flight is an important step in turning climate policy into practical solutions. If we are to succeed with the green transition, we must test, learn and build – not just plan. With this test arena, Norway is taking a leading role in the development of zero-emission aviation, while also creating new opportunities for green jobs and innovation,"" said Minister of Climate and Environment Andreas Bjelland Eriksen.

""Bristow is proud to be a part of this cutting-edge program and our participation in this test arena directly aligns with our philosophical 'crawl, walk, run' approach to developing Advanced Air Mobility for commercial operations,"" said Dave Stepanek, Bristow's Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation Officer. ""The information we learn through the test arena program will provide valuable operational insights that could help operators, manufacturers, and regulators better understand how best to move forward towards commercial operations.""

""To be delivering ALIA to our partners at Bristow and kicking off operational testing here in Norway is a big moment for BETA,"" said Shawn Hall, BETA's Chief Revenue Officer. ""Bristow has been with us from the start and shares our drive for progress, and Norway, with its spirit of innovation and modernization, is a perfect place to move this technology forward. Handing off the aircraft to a customer is, in part, a huge milestone, but it's also an important launchpad for all that comes next for the industry.""

Norway has already established itself as a leader in innovative clean mobility, with electric cars comprising 89 percent of new car registrations in 2024. This Test Arena is an evaluation of the benefits of AAM for the region and its residents — as well as an investigation into the requirements to build out an ecosystem for integrated operations.

With its unique design that optimizes for payload, range, and IFR capabilities, ALIA is well-suited for Norway's distributed geography and cold-weather conditions.

""This essential and meaningful step will support the industry, accelerate innovation in new mobility, and strengthen our expertise. We are excited to continue this critical work"", said Lars Kobberstad, Director General of CAA Norway. ""Aviation is a safe mode of transport and a well-regulated sector. As the aviation authority, we will ensure that we facilitate testing new technologies and contribute to safe testing and future integrations. We will learn how rules and regulations must evolve to enable new technologies and concepts. Through this, we aim to build the necessary expertise early on for tomorrow's solutions.""

""The first flight of the Test Arena is a major milestone for Norwegian aviation and for Avinor, and a key step towards future commercial operations of zero- and low-emission flights in Norway,"" said Abraham Foss, Avinor's Chief Executive Officer. ""As a small, open economy with a dispersed population, Norway is entirely dependent on aviation and its broad network of airports. We are strongly committed to driving the long-term transition to a more sustainable aviation sector, while maintaining strong domestic and international connectivity.""

A team of BETA pilots and maintainers have delivered this aircraft, N214BT, to the Test Arena following a weeks-long journey across the EU. The flights, which originated in Shannon, Ireland, have taken BETA's aircraft over the Irish Sea, through the UK, over the English Channel, and to the Paris Air Show — where ALIA flew every day — followed by Germany, Luxembourg, Denmark, and, ultimately, Norway.

Welcoming delegates, H.E. Diego Pardow Lorenzo, Minister of Energy of Chile, reaffirmed the host country’s support for ISA’s mission to deliver affordable solar solutions and expand regional partnerships.

“Latin America’s future lies in a diversified energy matrix. In Chile, our journey from hydro-dependence to solar leadership has shown that clean energy, supported by long-term contracts and private investment, can lower costs, boost resilience, and empower communities. Our focus now is on extending solar operational hours through storage and ensuring benefits reach our most vulnerable households. Regional cooperation is essential, only together can we scale technologies, share knowledge, and secure a competitive, sustainable energy future for our people.”

H.E. Kerryne Zennelle James, Minister for Climate Resilience, the Environment and Renewable Energy of Grenada, chaired the meeting in her capacity as Vice President of the ISA LAC Region, calling for strong leadership to turn ambition into action.

“Latin America and the Caribbean are global leaders in renewable energy, with 65% of our power already sourced from renewables, double the global average. But the path ahead is uneven, especially for small island states like Grenada. We are committed to a clean, resilient future through clear national policies, ongoing solar deployments, and strong partnerships. ISA’s strategic shift from ambition to action is timely, and this Regional Committee is a crucial platform to align our priorities and unlock collective progress.”

H.E. Abhilasha Joshi, Ambassador of India to Chile, reaffirmed India’s long-standing support for ISA and commitment to South-South cooperation for sustainable energy.

“With 116 GW of solar capacity and renewable energy targets of 50% of capacity from renewables set for 2030 already met five years ahead of schedule, we are working closely with partners across Latin America and the Caribbean to share solutions, catalyse finance, and drive innovation in solar energy. Together, through ISA, we can align regional priorities, promote joint R&D, and build a resilient and sustainable energy future.”

Mr. Ashish Khanna, Director General of ISA, outlined the LAC region’s strategic importance in the global solar landscape and presented ISA’s four-pillar vision: mobilising catalytic finance, strengthening institutional capacities, enabling regional platforms, and scaling innovation and solar technologies.

“With 26 countries now part of ISA in the LAC region, a 50% rise since 2021, the momentum is clear. With nine Caribbean countries agreeing to sign a joint declaration on SIDS, to work together on an aggregate e-procurement platform, establish a regional Centre of Excellence within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), announce the winners of the LAC SolarX Startup Challenge at COP30 in Belém, and deepen the partnership to enable private sector participation in the region through an MoU with the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), this presents a concrete vision and action plan for the LAC region. This is a clear shift from ambition to action.”

Key Outcomes and Announcements

Country Partnership Framework exchange between ISA and Grenada

The Country Partnership Framework will provide a structured approach for ISA and Grenada to collaborate on solar energy initiatives and support Grenada’s clean energy transition. Areas of collaboration will include strategic planning, regulatory support, technology development, capacity building, and solar deployment. The first CPF for the region was signed between ISA and Cuba earlier this year in New Delhi, India.

Pledge of Support adopted by leaders from Small Island Developing States (SIDS) for the ISA SIDS Platform

A transformative digital initiative anchored by ISA and the World Bank, the platform aims to accelerate inclusive, climate-resilient energy access across island nations. Nine Caribbean countries, Antigua & Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts & Nevis, Suriname, and Trinidad & Tobago, signed a Declaration of Intent at the 7th ISA Regional Committee Meeting to launch the SIDS Solar Platform. The platform will boost solar adoption through joint procurement, lower costs, and build regional capacity, advancing clean energy and resilience across island nations.

ISA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) have extended their MoU

The renewed MoU reinforces a shared commitment to accelerate solar deployment across the LAC region. It focuses on mobilising climate-aligned financing through platforms like the Global Solar Facility; building technical capacity via regional trainings, peer learning, and data sharing; harmonising policies; co-developing solar applications in agriculture, mobility, mini-grids, and storage; and supporting national planning through joint workplans, working groups, and outreach forums.

ISA and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) sign strategic MoU

This partnership will expand energy access and resilience through solar energy, support small island states with capacity-building and technical assistance, unlock catalytic finance for solar projects, and drive policy harmonisation and knowledge exchange. ISA and OECS aim to accelerate a sustainable, secure energy future for the Eastern Caribbean.

ISA hosts the SolarX Startup Challenge 2025 for the LAC region

The third edition of the Challenge, following successful editions in Africa and the Asia-Pacific, is open for applications until 15 August 2025. It seeks innovative, scalable, and cost-effective solar solutions addressing local energy challenges. The initiative aims to foster entrepreneurship, strengthen local ecosystems, and build capacity to accelerate solar adoption across the LAC region.

In his keynote address, H.E. Paulo Roberto Soares Pacheco, Brazilian Ambassador to Chile and representative of the incoming COP30 Presidency, stressed that access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy is inseparable from the fight against climate change and the path to sustainable development. He welcomed ISA’s efforts to scale solar solutions in LDCs and SIDS, emphasising the importance of cooperation and targeted support to accelerate the transition.

The meeting brought together ministers, ambassadors, senior government officials, industry leaders, and development partners from across Latin America and the Caribbean. Deliberations focused on accelerating the clean energy transition, scaling solar deployment in small island states, mobilising finance, strengthening partnerships, and fostering innovation to sustainably meet the region’s growing energy needs.

""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""
""Instead of cutting energy costs in half, like he promised, Donald Trump has taken an ax to popular bipartisan programs that help working families lower their energy costs,"" said Alex Glass, Climate Power communications director.
In 2024, domestic solar energy production hit a record-breaking 50 gigawatts of capacity, and the solar energy sector provided more than 263,000 American jobs, according to the Sierra Club.
According to the International Energy Agency, solar power is now the least expensive option for new electricity generation.","The Environmental Protection Agency's decision to cancel a Biden-era solar grant program will hinder efforts to lower energy bills for middle to low-income households, according to several environmental groups.

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency was terminating Solar for All, a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for resident solar projects.

Zeldin wrote on social media that the ""EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds ""to keep the program alive.""

""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!"" Zeldin wrote. '

Households will lose the ability to save hundreds of dollars annually by implementing energy-reducing measures provided by the program, Zealan Hoover, a former EPA senior advisor who was involved in the inception of the program, told ABC News.

""It would have significantly addressed the pain that so many families are facing with rapidly rising electricity prices,"" Hoover said.

The goal of Solar for All was to reduce electricity costs for low and middle-income households by distributing federal funds to states and other partners who made it easier for 900,000 households to take advantage of solar power and battery storage. Part of the Inflation Reduction Act, one of former President Joe Biden’s signature programs, the initiative estimated that it would save low-income households up to $400 a year on energy bills, create more than 200,000 jobs and cut toxic pollution by more than 30 million metric tons.

Funding for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens was awarded to 60 recipients, including states, tribes, nonprofits and local governments.

""The Trump administration is once again gutting critical funding for community solar and harming communities for its false 'energy emergency,'"" said Corey Solow, legislative director for climate and energy at Earthjustice, the nation's largest public interest environmental law firm, in a statement. ""Solar for All projects were spurring positive, on-the-ground change in communities – early investments will provide reliable energy and lower costs for communities that stand to benefit the most from the clean energy transition.""

The move is ""yet another blow"" to working families, Climate Power, a communications organization focused on climate action, said in a statement.

""Instead of cutting energy costs in half, like he promised, Donald Trump has taken an ax to popular bipartisan programs that help working families lower their energy costs,"" said Alex Glass, Climate Power communications director.

In 2024, domestic solar energy production hit a record-breaking 50 gigawatts of capacity, and the solar energy sector provided more than 263,000 American jobs, according to the Sierra Club.

The Trump administration's decision is ""denying our most vulnerable communities a resource that would have helped alleviate their financial burdens and improved their quality of life,"" Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp said in a statement.

EPA authority over the Solar for All program was eliminated under the tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump last month, Zeldin said.

The new tax law eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the Inflation Reduction Act, which set aside $20 billion for community projects for renewable energy, which the Solar for All program fell under.

The EPA's move to terminate the Solar for All program will likely be challenged in court, Hoover said.

""Terminating these grants midstream is not just reckless; it's legally and procedurally indefensible,"" said Jim Drummond, former lead grants attorney in EPA's Office of General Counsel said in a statement. ""The grants were awarded in accordance with established federal grant regulations and EPA's strong competition policies. To break these commitments retroactively not only undermines the rule of law, it also potentially exposes the federal government to liability and erodes trust in public institutions. In my opinion, this is a violation of basic administrative accountability.""

According to the International Energy Agency, solar power is now the least expensive option for new electricity generation.

The term sounds ominous, but it simply refers to factories that are so automated they can operate without lights.

Leading this charge is Zeekr, a premium EV brand launched by Chinese automotive giant Geely in 2021.

In just a few years, Zeekr has achieved production levels that took Tesla nearly a decade to reach.

China’s dark factories are scarily efficient

At Zeekr’s flagship plant in Ningbo, China, more than 800 robots work in perfect synchronization across the factory floor, welding, assembling, and prepping vehicles around the clock.

Human workers are, of course, still needed for wiring and robot maintenance. But most of the dark factory operates independently, creating an average of 800 electric cars per day.

This allows the autonomous factory to produce roughly 300,000 EVs a year.

This level of automation is part of China’s broader push to dominate the global EV sector by producing more electric vehicles than any other country.

Since 2015, China’s industrial robot usage has grown sevenfold.

According to Zeekr vice president Zhao Chunlin, the company is aiming for near-total lights-out production And each new model pushing the boundaries of robotic capability

But how beneficial can using robots be?

Well, a Chinese company recently unveiled a humanoid robot worker who can run 275 trillion operations per second. That’s slightly faster than the average human employee.

Chinese EVs pose a huge threat to US carmakers

The results aren’t just fast, either, as automation is both high quality and low cost at the same time.

Ford CEO Jim Farley recently admitted that the cost and craftsmanship of Chinese EVs are now surpassing Western offerings. And that poses a direct threat to traditional automakers.

In a market where speed, price, and innovation rule, Zeekr and its peers are setting new global benchmarks

Detroit’s automakers, which were once global leaders, are struggling to catch up.

US giants like Ford, GM, and Stellantis face shrinking EV market share, rising costs, and outdated factory models.

Meanwhile, China’s EV ecosystem includes over 600,000 companies, from battery makers to AI software providers, all integrated into a powerful, fast-moving supply chain.

With its dark factories, Zeekr is a symbol of China’s manufacturing future.

And unless Detroit radically transforms its approach, the real darkness may soon fall over the US auto industry itself, and Chinese cars may come to the US market sooner rather than later.",https://supercarblondie.com/wp-content/uploads/Untitled-2025-08-04T182324150.webp,N,,2025-08-08 20:59:38.788849

Only two projects have received the green light: A combined-cycle generator providing 1,360 megawatts of power in Person County, North Carolina.
Two combustion turbines providing a cumulative 850 MW of power at the Marshall Steam Station in Catawba County, North Carolina.
Duke attributes the buildout of energy generation resources, primarily natural gas, to the “unprecedented” growth in demand the utility expects.
The company is planning to file for a merger of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, creating one unified utility with the same rates across its territory.","Duke Energy made $985 million in profits last quarter, up 7.6% from last year. Rate hikes and economic development drove profits for the utility. That includes new commercial customers and new power-hungry data centers, such as the $10 billion Amazon data center investment in North Carolina that the utility actively courted.

The quarterly results come on the heels of new legislation that increases the ability to recover costs and removes a key North Carolina climate target.

When it comes to building new energy generation, the utility focused on its plans to build new natural gas generation, primarily in North Carolina, with two new turbines coming to the Marshall Steam Station on Lake Norman. Only two projects have received the green light:

A combined-cycle generator providing 1,360 megawatts of power in Person County, North Carolina. In-service date: 2028.

Two combustion turbines providing a cumulative 850 MW of power at the Marshall Steam Station in Catawba County, North Carolina. In-service date: 2028.

Duke attributes the buildout of energy generation resources, primarily natural gas, to the “unprecedented” growth in demand the utility expects. In the United States, natural gas combustion accounts for a higher share of carbon pollution than coal overall, but, in the electricity sector, coal still dominates.

To finance these and other projects, the company is working on two large cash transactions. Brookfield acquired a non-controlling share of the utility’s Florida company for $6 billion. Duke also plans to sell off its Piedmont Tennessee Natural Gas business for $2.4 billion.

The company is planning to file for a merger of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas, creating one unified utility with the same rates across its territory. The company predicts that this will save customers $1 billion through 2038. The merger, if approved, is expected to take effect in January 2026.

North Carolina’s recently passed Power Bill Reduction Act removes the utility’s 2030 carbon pollution reduction target, which would have required it to cut carbon pollution in the next five years. It also allows Duke to recover annual costs on ongoing capital projects, such as new nuclear reactors.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/151f219/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+215/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwfae%2Ffiles%2F201806%2FDuke-Energy-Substation.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 20:03:00.771673

Some deals are regional, but these are the cheapest lease deals on the market right now.
Spread across the 24 month lease term, that equals about $200 per month, making it the cheapest effective cost of any lease deal right now.
Right now, Volkswagen has a great lease deal for the ID 4 Pro RWD in California, Arizona, and Nevada.
The cheapest lease deal for the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is on the rear-wheel-drive SE trim with the standard range battery, and it's currently available in California.","Spending too much money on a car is a foolhardy endeavor. Some car enthusiasts may tell you otherwise, but it's never good to get in over your head on a car that continuously bleeds your bank account dry through refueling, insurance, and maintenance. In such a volatile economy it's best to stay well within your budget when finding a new car, and right now one of the best ways to do that is by taking advantage of a killer lease deal. As reported by the experts at Cars Direct who analyze hundreds of lease deals to find the cheapest cars to lease, all of the cheapest vehicles to lease right now happen to be electric and hybrid SUVs.

This is good news for people who need a versatile vehicle that can carry your family and most if not all of your family's stuff. Going electric may be a scary prospect for some folks, but it's easier now than ever before as more public EV chargers sprout up each day, and some of these vehicles are compatible with Tesla's vast Supercharging system.

These examples may not have the cheapest monthly payments on paper, but when you consider the amount of money due at signing and spread it across the duration of the lease, something called the effective cost, their monthly costs are lower than all other lease deals analyzed by Cars Direct. Some deals are regional, but these are the cheapest lease deals on the market right now.

The Honda Prologue has the cheapest lease offer on the market right now, though this particular deal is only available in certain states, and it's not like other deals. It's a ""One Pay Lease"" price, which means you pay $4,800 when you sign for the deal, and then you're done paying for the car. Spread across the 24 month lease term, that equals about $200 per month, making it the cheapest effective cost of any lease deal right now. It's for a 24-month lease with a mileage allowance of 10,000 miles per year.

This deal isn't necessarily ideal for people who need small monthly payments, but if you can cover the $4,800 cost due at signing, it makes for a screaming deal on this midsize electric SUV. This deal is only offered in the following states: CA, CO, CT, Washington DC, DE, FL, MD, ME, MN, MA, NH, NJ, NY, OR, PA, RI, VA, VT, WA, and WV. The offer expires on September 2. Honda just began offering an NACS adapter that allows the Prologue to charge at Tesla Superchargers, which vastly increases the number of public chargers owners can access.

Right now, Volkswagen has a great lease deal for the ID 4 Pro RWD in California, Arizona, and Nevada. It requires $2,499 due at signing and $129 per month for 24 months with a mileage allowance of 10,000 miles per year. When spread equally across the 24-month lease period, the effective cost is $233 per month. This deal is available through September 30, so it allows you an extra month to weigh your options before committing to the lease.

This is a better deal for people looking for a lower down payment than the Prologue, though the availability of this great lease deal is much more geographically limited. The ID 4 Pro RWD trim has an acceptable EPA maximum range estimate of 291 miles, and Volkswagen says it should be offering NACS adapters by now to allow its EVs to access the Tesla Supercharger network.

This is a fantastic deal on a fun SUV, but it has a very limited scope. It's exclusively available in the state of California, and it's only advertised for Wrangler 4xe Sport S vehicles with equipment package 29U. The lease deal is $149 per month for 24 months with $3,309 due at signing, and it only includes a very low mileage limit of 5,000 miles per year. Cars Direct says there are similar deals in other regions, but this is the best lease deal on the Wrangler 4xe plug-in hybrid at the moment with an effective cost of $287 per month.

This is the only hybrid vehicle on this list of cheap leases, so if you're not ready to fully commit to an EV lifestyle, this offers a way to dip a toe in. The 29U equipment package is the Customer Preferred Package that includes desirable features like LED headlights, a trailer tow package, and the Convenience Group, Technology Group, and Active Safety Group packages, worth $8,440. Again, it's a very limited lease, but you can always go over the mileage allotment and pay per-mile after the fact and it may still end up being a great deal depending on your needs.

Subaru is offering its 2025 Solterra Premium for $279 per month for 36 months with $279 due at signing and a mileage limit of 10,000 miles per year. This lease deal is currently only advertised for the Los Angeles area, so check for deals in your region, but this is a very cheap lease with an effective cost of $287 per month.

The 2025 Solterra isn't the most advanced EV, but it's better than earlier Solterras, and it still comes standard with dual-motor all-wheel-drive. It received updates for the 2024 model year which improved its maximum charging speeds, but its maximum estimated range is lower than most other EVs at just 227 miles on a full charge.

The cheapest lease deal for the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is on the rear-wheel-drive SE trim with the standard range battery, and it's currently available in California. The deal is $149 per month for 36 months with $3,999 due at signing, and a mileage limit of 10,000 miles per year. Though this particular deal is only advertised in California, Cars Direct says there are similar Ioniq 5 lease deals in other regions, too, so be sure to check what's available in your region.

The effective cost of this lease deal is $260 per month, which is a great deal on a great car. For 2025 Hyundai refreshed the Ioniq 5, giving it an NACS charge port that allows it to easily access the Tesla Supercharger network. If you don't want a base model, the Ioniq 5 SEL also has a great lease deal with the same terms for $189 per month, bumping the effective cost up to $300 per month.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-five-cheapest-cars-to-lease-in-august-are-all-electric-and-hybrid-suvs/l-intro-1754682975.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:04:23.079082

Environmental groups are vowing to fight after the Trump administration canceled the grant funding a no-cost rooftop solar program in Georgia.

The Environmental Protection Agency has announced it’s canceling the $7 billion Solar for All grant program, part of the Biden administration’s signature climate law. In a statement on social media, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said the budget reconciliation bill signed by President Trump last month eliminated the authority for the program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ he said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

A $156 million-dollar Solar for All grant was funding Georgia BRIGHT, a set of programs offering rooftop solar energy for low- and middle-income Georgians who couldn’t previously afford it. Their programs promise 20-70% savings on energy costs by allowing clients to generate their own electricity so they buy less from their power company.

Now, the organization said it has received notice that its grant was terminated.

“We are deeply disappointed and fully prepared to use every avenue legally available to us to regain access to the funds,” said Georgia BRIGHT director Alicia Brown in a statement. “In taking this action, the EPA would prevent 16,000 Georgians with low incomes from saving hundreds of dollars per year on their utility bills at a time of soaring energy costs, and they are putting at risk hundreds of good-paying, local jobs just as unemployment has begun to rise.”

Similarly, the Southern Environmental Law Center called the grant cancellations “unlawful” and vowed to fight them.

“We will see them in court,” said Kym Meyer, SELC litigation director, in a statement when reports of the forthcoming grant termination circulated earlier this week. “We have already seen the immense good this program has done on the ground and we won’t let it be snatched away to score political points.”

Georgia BRIGHT’s no-cost solar program opened Aug. 4. Nearly 1,000 households signed up in the first 72 hours, the organization said. A drawing to randomly select about 400 recipients was planned for September.

Now, the program is on hold, as are three additional programs Georgia BRIGHT planned to launch to offer low-cost solar for homes and businesses.

Atlanta faces some of the highest energy burdens in the country, meaning residents pay a high percentage of their monthly income toward energy costs. Nearly 5 million households in the south face high energy burdens, according to SELC. Programs funded by Solar for All are required to deliver energy savings of at least 20%.

“When we applied for this funding, we did so on behalf of all Georgians,” said Brown. “We will fight for this program because the rule of law matters and because Georgia families, small businesses, and the local economy can’t afford to lose the benefits we are poised to deliver.”",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2025/05/20250422DesotoSolarFarm-194-1-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 20:01:42.815682

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

But architects do so much more than make things visually appealing: They build better communities by increasing accessibility, addressing inequities, protecting the environment and improving lives.

“Architecture,” explains Brendan Wittstruck, MArch ’11, MAUD ’11, MCM ’11, “is a life of service.” A landscape architect and urban designer at Dunaway in Austin, Texas, Wittstruck focuses on incorporating nature into urban spaces.

I wanted to use my undergraduate degree in art to address pressing climate issues. A career in architecture seemed like the best next step to merging my interests in art and sustainability. WashU won me over with its emphasis on community design. But when a good friend at WashU encouraged me to take an urban design intro class, I realized that was the scale of impact I was looking for. Somehow, I ended up being a landscape architect, but I still hang on to a lot of the design training I got in architecture.

Landscape architecture and urban design can positively impact the broader ecology and connect people with green spaces within cities, making these areas more livable. There are so many benefits to integrating landscaping into people’s lives. Trees and other plants improve air quality and local climate. Data shows that green spaces shorten hospital visits and improve moods. And park access is a huge indicator for quality of life in cities.

To make urban areas more livable, we must address inequities. When it comes to public spaces, it’s so important to keep in mind who we’re designing for and make sure we’re not leaving people out. Will this space be comfortable and safe for women? Have we considered the needs of parents? Is there accessibility for strollers? What happens when the “eyes on the street” are prejudiced? Urban design as a practice is rethinking older ideas of environmental design that intentionally and unintentionally excluded many people from participating in the public realm.

Highway removal is another way to improve urban lives. Since I did my thesis on highway removal at WashU, the “freeway fighters” movement has gained momentum. Nationally, there is a striking pattern of highway projects razing and disconnecting communities of color. Highways in cities just don’t make any sense: They take up too much space, cut up neighborhoods, pollute, and can actually make traffic worse. Their purported benefits are completely eclipsed by their negative impacts on the urban environment and surrounding communities.",https://source.washu.edu/app/uploads/2025/07/Brendan-Wittstruck.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:04:42.012939

Donald Trump has been tilting at windmills since 2011, when plans emerged to develop a wind farm near his Scottish golf course. On the 2024 campaign trail, he frequently railed against the “green new scam,” criticized electric vehicles and solar panels, and vowed to “end” offshore wind “on Day 1.” On his first day back in office, he suspended all new offshore wind leasing, declared a fake “national energy emergency,” and ordered agencies to withhold congressionally mandated funding for clean energy and climate change.

Another major blow to the growing clean energy economy came on July 4. That’s when Trump signed Republicans’ 10-year partisan budget – the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” – which slashes clean energy funding and perpetuates our dependence on fossil fuels.

Here’s our breakdown of this disastrous bill and how we can expect to feel its impacts here in New England. The bottom line: The news isn’t good, but in the end, the clean energy economy is unstoppable.

What Does the “Big Beautiful Bill” Do?

The national implications of the “Big Beautiful Bill” are staggering. To pay for massive tax breaks for corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the bill severely cuts Medicaid and food assistance for families who can’t afford healthcare or groceries. The bill also eliminates hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy authorized under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Among other things, the bill:

Rapidly phases out tax credits for wind and solar projects and adds complicated restrictions on foreign-produced components;

Terminates credits to individuals and businesses to buy electric vehicles and install charging infrastructure;

Ends home energy efficiency credits designed to reduce energy usage;

Cancels incentives for developers to build efficient homes and commercial buildings;

Eliminates credits for rooftop solar, geothermal heating, and battery storage systems that help households reduce energy costs; and

Rescinds funding for dozens of programs that promote clean energy, help states address climate change, and empower disadvantaged communities to design and implement their own pollution and climate strategies.

At the same time, consistent with Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” mantra, the “Big Beautiful Bill” gives unprecedented handouts to the fossil fuel industry. The bill:

Mandates onshore and offshore oil and gas leasing, opens sensitive areas for drilling, and expands coal extraction on federal lands;

Reinstates non-competitive oil and gas leasing, lengthens lease terms, and reduces royalties developers pay to the U.S. Treasury;

Creates a “pay-to-play” scheme that allows developers to pay a fee in exchange for expedited environmental reviews of their proposed projects;

Eliminates funding to reduce emissions of methane (a potent greenhouse gas) and delays a fee for methane releases; and

Provides huge tax breaks to fossil fuel developers.

Three days after signing the bill, Trump ordered the Internal Revenue Service to restrict the use of any remaining clean energy tax credits. He also directed the Department of the Interior to end policies that promote wind and solar energy.

Since then, Trump’s war on clean energy has only escalated. Just this week, the administration announced plans to cut the Biden-era Solar for All program, which aimed to make solar power available to low-income households. The goal is clear: to bully the clean energy industry out of existence and line the pockets of Trump’s fossil fuel donors.

Analysts project that the “Big Beautiful Bill” may kill hundreds of planned wind and solar projects across the country. New clean energy capacity could decrease as much as 59%. U.S. climate-damaging emissions could rise 7% or more compared to the scenario before the bill was enacted.

How Does the “Big Beautiful Bill” Impact New England?

According to a state-level analysis by Energy Innovation, the “Big Beautiful Bill” will slow clean energy deployment, raise household energy costs, and eliminate thousands of jobs across New England.

Lost Renewable Energy Capacity

The “Big Beautiful Bill” will substantially decrease the region’s renewable energy capacity. By 2035, New England will lose 7,340 megawatts of wind, solar, and battery storage capacity, enough to serve roughly three to four million homes. That’s equivalent to the entire population of northern New England. Connecticut and Massachusetts are hit particularly hard, losing 3,900 and 1,800 megawatts, respectively.

Such a drastic cut in local clean energy sources means more reliance on polluting fossil fuels, less energy independence, and higher bills across the region.

Higher Household Energy Bills

Increasing summer heat and the growth of AI data centers are driving up energy demand and consumer costs. Nearly 100% of new electricity resources proposed for New England’s power grid are wind, solar, and battery projects. Without these resources, gas and coal-fired power plants will need to run more frequently. These plants are more expensive to build and operate, so that will drive up prices across the region. Electricity rates could increase as much as 10% by 2035, and New Englanders may pay $100 to nearly $200 more per year for electricity.

At a time when New Englanders already pay some of the highest electricity rates in the country, this is clearly the wrong direction for our communities and our region.

Decreased Economic Activity and Thousands of Lost Jobs

As deployment of new clean energy resources and advanced manufacturing declines, New England will lose out on substantial private investment. The “Big Beautiful Bill” is projected to cost the region nearly $18 billion in economic growth by 2034. Workers will suffer from factory closures and construction halts. Within five years, the bill could result in the loss of nearly 14,000 jobs across New England, including 3,400 in Connecticut and 6,300 in Massachusetts.

The Impacts are Being Felt, but the Clean Energy Transition is Unstoppable

Importantly, this analysis does not consider the administration’s latest attacks on wind and solar energy. Thus, the impacts of Trump’s war on clean energy, many of which will take months or years to materialize, will likely be more severe. But some are already here.

In mid-June, the Maine Governor’s Energy Office asked the state’s utility regulator to indefinitely extend a July deadline to issue its first offshore wind solicitation. The reason? “…recent changes in the energy landscape that have caused significant uncertainty in the offshore wind industry.” On June 30, Massachusetts utilities and two major wind project developers, Avangrid and Ocean Winds, delayed signing contracts for the third time since Trump took office “due to ongoing uncertainty caused by federal level activities.”

The same day, Ocean Winds and a Rhode Island utility delayed their contract for the fourth time. The utility may terminate the project’s selection if negotiations are not successful before November 1. In mid-July, New Leaf Energy, a clean energy developer in Lowell, Massachusetts, laid off 41 employees – a fifth of its workforce – due to “the Federal government’s decision to end the investment tax credit . . . for solar and wind energy.”",https://www.clf.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Detail-New-London-Wind-Staging-Site-Jamie-Flynn.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 23:03:27.321549

The new budget law delivers deep cuts for programs like renewable energy, tree-planting, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It also includes boons for oil drilling and exploration, and increases demand for timber from national forests. White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers told Grist that its policies will “turbocharge energy production” and “deliver further relief to American families and businesses.”

But one month since its signing, the Republican megabill seems to be doing the opposite. Program administrators, energy experts, and tribal leaders across the country said there is chaos and confusion as they wait to hear the fate of IRA-funded programs worth billions of dollars.

Grist reports from four locations on how local groups are wading through the cuts and uncertainty.

Appalachia

In the days and weeks following Hurricane Helene last September, most communities across western North Carolina sat in a complete electrical blackout. Sundance Power Systems, a small solar company in the town of Weaverville, partnered with the energy nonprofit Footprint Project to restore power by deploying dozens of microgrids.

“We loaded solar panels and batteries up in the back of our ’97 Chevy, and we went around and started providing power to people who didn’t have it,” said Dave Hollister, CEO of Sundance Power Systems.

Hollister and colleagues at other clean energy companies soon noticed a trend: Areas with solar panels installed before the storm seemed to fare well in Helene’s aftermath, leading them to wonder whether the systems could not only help restore power to impacted communities, but also prepare the region for its next storm.

The IRA clean energy tax credits that made solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, and other renewable energy home modifications financially accessible are now being rolled back due to the Republican budget bill.

“Tax credits were part of the business model here in North Carolina,” Hollister said. “It’s been an important part of giving folks the ability to choose renewable energy as their preferred energy source.”

Admittedly, the IRA tax credits often disproportionately benefitted wealthy families, for whom the write-off made a bigger difference simply because their taxes were bigger to begin with. But there were additional provisions like the “direct pay” tax credit system that allowed nonprofits and governments to take on costs of clean energy installation at the community level, further bolstering solar for lower- and middle-income families. Direct Pay has not been rolled back by the Trump administration as yet. Some entities, like Mountain BizWorks, a nonprofit lender in western North Carolina, can still take advantage of that to fund new clean energy projects — but they’re watching its status closely.

“It definitely adds a bit of urgency and would encourage folks, if they’ve been thinking about pursuing some of those projects, to act now,” said Eric Burton, BizWorks director of energy and climate lending. Commercial tax credits extend through 2027 rather than 2025, but it’s still a tight timeline.

Midwest

Two years ago, Doris Martin, a retired computer scientist, completely retooled her home on the South Side of Chicago. She ditched her oil furnace, water heater, washer, dryer, and stove in favor of energy-efficient electrical appliances that take advantage of growing wind and solar power, lower air pollution in the home, and reduce the carbon dioxide her personal footprint spews into the air.

These days, it’s not unusual for neighbors to ring her doorbell and ask about the heat pump standing in her backyard. They also want to know about her utility bills, which sometimes dip as low as $12.

“It’s like I always hit the lottery,” Martin said.

Martin’s great uncle built the home in 1957, and she and her daughter moved in about 20 years ago. The house had remained relatively unchanged — it even had the original doors. With help from Elevate, a Chicago-based nonprofit tackling utility affordability issues, Martin was able to transform her home into a model of energy efficiency. But the financial incentives that made her retrofit possible — federal tax credits — are now disappearing under the Republican-backed budget bill.

The loss comes just as Chicago and the Midwest were beginning to emerge as national leaders in implementing the carbon-cutting technologies.

Midwestern homeowners were among the most active users of the now-expiring tax credits. In 2023, Wisconsin ranked sixth nationwide for the use of the home energy-efficiency tax credits available through the IRA. Michigan came in at ninth. States like Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio all appeared in the top 20, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate, warns that the cuts will have far-reaching impacts. Her organization helps retrofit about 50,000 homes a year in the Chicago area, relying on a mix of federal tax credits, utility programs, and philanthropic funding. Without the federal incentives, she expects fewer families will be able to afford the upgrades.

“It’s not only going to result in people having higher utility bills,” said Evans. “It’s also going to reduce the jobs that are created through all of this economic activity.”

While the federal tax credits are disappearing, Alex Amends, communications director at Rewiring America, stressed that other pathways to energy efficiency remain. His team is currently tracking approximately 4,000 active incentives across 29 states and is working on adding information for Ohio and North Carolina.

“Thankfully, thousands of programs at the state, local, and utility levels remain in place,” Amends said. “The opportunity is still here and momentum remains strong. People want the better option.”

Southeast

For years, high upfront costs and tax credit structures made it difficult for all but the wealthiest Americans to install home solar. But the Biden-era IRA opened the door to a new kind of rooftop solar program that helped lower-income households tap into the technology and save on their energy bills. Nonprofits were able to claim tax credits as a direct payment from the government, then pass that money on as savings to homeowners who couldn’t otherwise afford rooftop systems. The financial services nonprofit Capital Good Fund coupled that opportunity with a $156 million Solar for All grant — another IRA provision — to fund a suite of low- or no-cost solar-lease programs in Georgia, known as Georgia Bright.

Those plans are now complicated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Georgia Bright is better off than some IRA-funded programs because its money was already committed last year. The Republican budget megabill only rolls back unobligated funds. “For now, everything is proceeding as normal,” said Alicia Brown, the director of Georgia Bright. “We are still submitting reimbursement requests and those are being honored.” (That is despite reports that the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to terminate Solar for All grants. As of August 5, Georgia Bright’s funding was still legally obligated, Brown said.)

But Georgia Bright promises its clients energy savings of 20 percent to 70 percent that are made possible by the IRA’s clean energy tax credits structure. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will now restrict tax credits from going to what it calls a “foreign entity of concern,” defined as “own[ing] in aggregate 40 percent” of a project. There are ongoing efforts to shift solar panel manufacturing to the U.S., but progress is slow and many components still come from overseas. Organizations like Georgia Bright are still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department on how exactly that threshold will be calculated, Brown said.

“Is it just major components? Are we also talking, like, bolts and screws and encapsulants and small things like that?” she said. “If we claim a tax credit we’re not eligible for — I mean, as a nonprofit it could put us out of business.”

The organization is moving ahead with its programs, including launching a drawing for no-cost solar installations in August, Brown said, while also “considering ways to be nimble.” That could mean reducing the number of households enrolled in Georgia Bright, or finding other ways to make up the savings.

“We’re going to keep focusing on doing the work,” said Brown. “Honestly, that’s the best thing you can do to justify a program — show that it’s doing good work for everyone in every congressional district.”

Great Lakes

Among his many roles, Robert Blake, a tribal citizen of the Red Lake Nation in Minnesota, is the executive director of the nonprofit Native Sun Community Power Development. He also owns Solar Bear, a solar-installation company based in Minneapolis. Solar Bear has built four solar projects in the Red Lake Nation, which Blake said bolstered local green energy capacity and provided job and technical training for community members. He sees this kind of work as central to Red Lake’s energy sovereignty — making power more affordable for tribal members and reducing reliance on the broader grid.

Blake had hoped that Department of Energy loan initiatives — such as the Tribal Energy Finance Program, also called the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program — would help them finance additional projects. The IRA expanded the tribal finance program’s credit subsidies and loan guarantees, allowing for more funding for energy projects in Indian Country. The law increased the credit subsidy to $75 million through September 2028, and increased the program’s loan authority from $2 billion to $20 billion. But the Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates nearly all of these funds.

“For small players like myself, and for tribal communities that are traditionally underserved or [under]invested in, this really makes it just that much more difficult,” Blake said.

The recent cuts were merely the latest setback for a program that has struggled to gain momentum, according to Jen Lerch, a senior advisor of the program until April who has worked in tribal finance for decades. The loan program office is critical to developing energy infrastructure, Lerch said, but there’s a fundamental misunderstanding of tribes and tribal finance. “Tribes are public bodies. They are likened to states in the eyes of the law, and certainly should be in the credit market,” she said. “So to approach tribal infrastructure energy financing as though it is, let’s say, Tesla or Rivian, is a grave error.”

Tribes in other parts of the Great Lakes have also seen direct impacts from the legislation. In northern Michigan, Interlochen Public Radio reported that the budget law rescinded $20 million from the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, an environmental nonprofit, and local conservancies. This was under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Regional Conservation Partnership Program. The groups had already spent $450,000 on work to preserve agricultural land and restore streams and rivers — money they will no longer get reimbursed for from the federal government. While the Republican megabill rescinded IRA funds injected into the program, it actually increased its yearly appropriation overall, and the groups will likely apply again. The tribe is also appealing to get back the originally promised funding. Unless that happens, however, they remain in the red.

The Department of Energy didn’t provide comment for this story.

How to take advantage of energy efficiency incentives while you still can

The clean energy tax credit covers up to 30 percent of costs for installing new clean energy infrastructure in your home — but time is running out. Experts say you can still take advantage of the clean energy tax credit, as well as the energy-efficiency home improvement credit, with pretty much any contractor until December 31, 2025 (compared to a gradual phaseout beginning in 2033, originally set in the Inflation Reduction Act). That means expenses you rack up on clean energy and energy efficiency are still eligible until the end of the year. But it’s best to get to it fast — contractors are getting booked quickly.

Congress has repeatedly recognized the importance of climate resilience, frequently directing funds to federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to help states and other entities prepare for the effects of climate change.

Our changing climate has increased the frequency and severity of life-threatening hazards in Washington such as heatwaves, wildfires, drought, and flooding, and caused slower moving but devastating changes such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, and loss of mountain snowpack.

Congress has repeatedly recognized the importance of climate resilience, frequently directing funds to federal agencies like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to help states and other entities prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2022 and 2023, NOAA announced two climate resilience-focused funding opportunities that emphasized equity, inclusion, and engagement with historically underrepresented communities that are disproportionately exposed to the effects of climate change. Washington was awarded funding through both programs.

But on May 5, NOAA abruptly — and unlawfully — terminated both awards, saying the programs were inconsistent with the president’s new priorities. That arbitrary move to withhold the funds has real impact for Washington — jeopardizing jobs and threatening to undermine the state’s comprehensive climate resilience strategy.

“Climate change is here, and Washington communities need to prepare and build resilience,” Brown said. “The federal government promised funding to help local communities adapt, and we’re holding them to it.”

Tribal Stewards Program

One of the projects targeted is the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges (SBCTC) Tribal Stewards Program. NOAA awarded SBCTC $9.3 million just last year to develop a network of Washington colleges, tribes, and employers and to educate 2,130 post-secondary students in wildlife biology, environmental science, and other natural resource degrees with a focus on climate resilience.

Eleven employers had already committed to hiring Tribal Stewards graduates, who would have filled positions in some of the state’s most economically depressed regions and areas most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.

“NOAA’s decision to abruptly stop funding Washington’s Tribal Stewards Program directly impacts future workers who want to start work in well-paying climate resilience jobs and employers in these in-demand fields,” said Nate Humphrey, SBCTC executive director. “Without this funding, Washington’s colleges and tribes will not be able to keep workers up to date with industry trends, putting our state at risk of falling behind in these important specialties.”

Advancing an Equitable Framework for Coastal Resilience

The other program targeted by the cuts is the Department of Ecology’s project titled Advancing an Equitable Framework for Coastal Resilience in Washington State. NOAA awarded the project $250,000 in 2023 to reduce environmental and health disparities by supporting local efforts to address coastal hazards.

NOAA’s withholding of nearly half the funds, approximately $114,000, brings that work to a halt, leaving Washington’s coastal communities vulnerable to flooding, erosion, and other hazards.

The complaint says the U.S. Department of Commerce and NOAA violated the Administrative Procedure Act by, among other things, taking arbitrary and capricious action to terminate the funding. The suit argues that the agencies’ actions are unconstitutional because they violated the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause and foundational separation of powers principles.

The state asks the court to determine that the agencies’ actions were unlawful and unconstitutional and to reverse the terminations.

Assistant Attorneys General Caitlin Soden, Leah Brown, and Ellen Range, and Paralegals Joshua Bennett and Julie Dolloff worked on the case for Washington state.

A copy of the complaint is available here.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sent out an official letter to the Texas Solar for All Coalition to confirm the end of the ""Solar for All"" grant program, which was part of Biden-era energy and climate policies.

The coalition sent KVUE the following statement about the cut:

""We are currently assessing the real impacts this will have on everyday Texans and the various organizations that came together to make this program happen. The Solar for All program set out to support families facing rising energy costs, and to ensure local job creation, boost investments in Made-in-America manufacturing, and promote energy independence. Ending this program would be a huge loss for Texas, and we all stand firm in our fight to protect this vital investment in our state.”

Austin Energy was set to earn $32 million that would've helped install solar and battery storage to 2,500 low-income households and 25 multifamily and community service facilities for free.

“We are disappointed by this announcement. Congress had established the Solar for All program specifically to make energy more affordable for everyday Americans,” Austin Energy Interim General Manager Stuart Reilly said in a statement. “Our local implementation of this grant was set to innovate in solar and energy storage. Despite this setback, Austin Energy remains committed to advancing affordable, sustainable and resilient solutions for our community.”

Austin City Councilmember Ryan Alter said the cut wasn't a surprise, but the city was depending on the grant to help with projects connected to the Generation and Climate Protection Plan that was adopted last year to meet energy needs.

""The federal government continues to slash anything that is benefiting whether it's our social safety net, our climate, the things that we all hold dear. They have taken not a scalpel, but a machete,"" Alter said. ""While it does have a direct impact for these families, it also has a grid and system wide impact for how we generate our electricity.""

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin posted a video statement to the social media platform X, saying, ""With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars. ""

Solar Austin President Juan Afanador said the country should be investing in solar energy and said as prices goes up, so will electricity bills.

Some Republican officials praised the shift away from clean energy goals.
As it got rid of its clean energy goals, APS also confirmed it will keep its Four Corners coal plant, originally slated to close in 2031, online as late as 2038.
We'll use this tool to help increase our clean energy,’” Sundareshan said.
“The securitization bill signed by Governor Hobbs still helps Arizona build more clean energy while guaranteeing lower costs and delivering even more energy.","Arizona Democrats are criticizing Arizona Public Service for reneging on a commitment to transition to 100% clean energy over the next three decades, claiming the state’s largest electric utility misled lawmakers and Gov. Katie Hobbs about its plans.

Earlier this week, APS CEO Ted Geisler informed stockholders that the utility was getting rid of the clean energy commitments implemented by his predecessor just five years ago, including a goal to reach 100% clean energy by 2050.

The move drew swift criticism from Democrats, environmental groups and renewable energy advocates around the state.

“This decision sets us back. It makes our air dirtier, hurts our growing clean energy economy, and forfeits the cost savings of renewable options,” Hobbs said on social media.

Some Republican officials praised the shift away from clean energy goals.

That includes Arizona Corporation Commission Chairman Kevin Thompson, who leads the government body that regulates APS and other utilities. He echoed statements by APS officials, who said the change was needed to ensure the reliability of Arizona’s electric grid as the population grows.

“APS is looking at the bigger picture of ‘how do we ensure that we can keep the air conditioning on when it's 120 outside?’” he said.

Critics have rejected that argument, saying an increase in clean and renewable energies can be part of a reliable grid.

And Sen. Priya Sundareshan (D-Tucson), an environmental attorney and the top Democrat in the Arizona Senate, said the move stands in stark contrast to the message APS itself sent to lawmakers last session when it lobbied for a new state law giving utilities more financial flexibility to manage their debt.

“Securitization is a tool that has been used in other states and has been championed in other states by clean energy advocates as a way to help utilities transition away from fossil fuel generation and into more clean energy,” Sundareshan said, referring to House Bill 2679, which APS helped craft.

APS representatives argued the legislation gives utilities a tool to divest from inefficient power plants while giving them the financial flexibility to invest in more efficient alternatives.

“That's certainly how the utilities, especially APS, who was very heavily behind the push for the securitization bill, that's how they were characterizing the securitization bill — that it would be bringing this tool that helps with the clean energy transition,” Sundareshan said.

An APS spokesman said the utility remains committed to lowering carbon emissions while ensuring reliability and affordability for ratepayers.

“While much has changed in the industry and in Arizona over the last several years, that dedicated focus has not,” spokesman Mike Philipsen wrote in an email. “More people and businesses are moving to Arizona at record levels and our customers count on us for power every day. It would be irresponsible if we saw the challenges ahead and failed to plan for them.”

Philipsen said APS shifted to a new goal to be “carbon neutral” by 2050. He said that aligns with goals set by other Arizona utilities.

Unlike the commitment to eliminate its carbon emissions by using 100% clean energy, a carbon-neutral pledge means a company will attempt to offset its emissions.

“To be clear, APS remains committed to clean-energy resources that are cost-competitive and help ensure reliable service for our customers,” Philipsen wrote. “Clean-energy resources — such as solar paired with battery-energy storage — that provide a ‘best-fit, least-cost’ solution to serving our customers (as demonstrated through our competitive all-source request for proposal process) will continue to be a key part of how we provide reliable and affordable service to our customers.”

HB 2679 passed through the Legislature with some bipartisan support and was signed into law by Hobbs, the Democratic governor, despite opposition from some prominent environmental and renewable energy advocates.

“We are extremely disappointed in the Governor’s action today. HB2679 will help advance the Trump coal agenda, keeping dirty coal plants operating longer, and benefitting utility shareholders to the detriment of ratepayers, our air, our water, and our health,” Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter, said after the signing.

As it got rid of its clean energy goals, APS also confirmed it will keep its Four Corners coal plant, originally slated to close in 2031, online as late as 2038.

Despite some bipartisan support, HB 2679 received no Democratic votes in the Senate “because it was way too broad, not limited to clean energy generation or retiring old fossil fuel generation assets,” Sundareshan said.

When she signed the bill, Hobbs said she heard concerns from clean energy advocates who opposed the original version of the bill, “and I made it better.”

""Because of this bill, Arizona families will save money and we will help create more jobs in a clean energy economy that, in just the last few years, has brought nearly $18 billion in investments to our state and created over 18,000 quality jobs,” Hobbs said at the time.

Sundareshan said Democrats who backed the bill were duped.

“The message that the utilities had been pushing was, ‘Don't worry about it. We've still got our clean energy goals. We'll use this tool to help increase our clean energy,’” Sundareshan said. “Unfortunately, I think they were successful in making some Democratic legislators and the governor even believe their empty promises.”

Hobbs' office repeated its criticism of APS for getting rid of its zero-carbon goals but defended the governor’s decision to sign HB 2679.

“Securitization must remain a tool in our clean energy economy toolbox,” spokesman Christian Slater said. “The securitization bill signed by Governor Hobbs still helps Arizona build more clean energy while guaranteeing lower costs and delivering even more energy. It has nothing to do with this latest announcement.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4cbb19f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1395x732+0+26/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fbe%2F9d28193e4bf8b4ae21ee7015546e%2Faps-four-corners-coal-plant-20250808.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 19:00:45.775624

“This legal fiction poses an existential threat to communities that remain invisible in the licensing process,” said Ana Alfinito, legal advisor at Amazon Watch.
Given this scenario, Amazon Watch reaffirms its opposition to Bill 2.159/2021 and joins the broader civil society call urging Congress to uphold the presidential vetoes.
Ana Alfinito, legal advisor at Amazon Watch, explains: “The presidential veto is significant and must be acknowledged.
“Many institutional actors involved in the legislative debates appear to agree on the need to simplify and accelerate environmental licensing.","Brasilia, Brazil – On Friday, August 8, the Brazilian government vetoed 63 provisions of Bill 2.159/2021, widely known as the Environmental Licensing Bill or the “Devastation Bill.” The decision came after intense pressure from civil society organizations, Indigenous leaders, and environmental defenders, who submitted a petition with over 1 million signatures urging President Lula to reject the bill in its entirety.

While the veto rolls back some of the most harmful measures approved by Congress, it leaves intact several provisions that still pose serious risks and demand close public scrutiny.

Among the positive outcomes, the veto blocks the expansion of the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC) mechanism for medium-impact projects, preventing risky ventures from moving forward based solely on self-declaration. It also maintains protections for Conservation Units, Indigenous and Quilombola communities, and ecologically sensitive biomes like the Atlantic Forest.

Crucially, the decision preserves requirements for environmental impact assessments and reaffirms the technical authority of key regulatory agencies, including Ibama, ICMBio, and Iphan.

The veto offers partial progress by restoring protections for Indigenous and Afrodescendent communities in the licensing process, but it fails to address deeper structural injustices – such as the historic denial of recognition and protection for Indigenous territories that remain undemarcated. Hundreds of Indigenous lands remain unrecognized and will continue to be excluded from the licensing process, while arbitrary distance limits – like the 8 km rule for mining, beyond which communities are no longer considered impacted – still deny communities the right to be consulted, even when serious environmental risks are present.

“This legal fiction poses an existential threat to communities that remain invisible in the licensing process,” said Ana Alfinito, legal advisor at Amazon Watch.

One of the bill’s most controversial provisions – the Special Environmental License (LAE) – remains in effect under a new executive order (provisional measure) issued with immediate applicability. Although the veto eliminated the option to issue all licenses in a single step, the LAE still fast-tracks high-impact infrastructure, mining, and oil exploration projects – especially in ecologically and socially vulnerable regions of the Amazon.

At an August 8 press conference, Environment and Climate Change Minister Marina Silva emphasized the importance of institutional dialogue and public engagement in shaping Brazil’s environmental licensing policy:

“The participation of all sectors of society involved in the licensing debate only shows how strategic the environmental agenda truly is. May this ongoing dialogue with Congress lead us to solutions that benefit environmental protection, sustainable development, and the safeguarding of traditional peoples and communities, so that Brazil may usher in a new era of prosperity, where the economy and ecology are not at odds, but part of the same equation.”

Amazon Watch views the government’s position as a reflection of competing political and economic pressures, including internal divisions. While the decision avoids some of the worst outcomes, it fails to fully defend environmental and Indigenous rights. On the eve of COP30, Brazil missed the opportunity to send a clear global signal about its commitment to climate justice and the protection of Amazonian peoples and ecosystems.

Given this scenario, Amazon Watch reaffirms its opposition to Bill 2.159/2021 and joins the broader civil society call urging Congress to uphold the presidential vetoes.

Ana Alfinito, legal advisor at Amazon Watch, explains:

“The presidential veto is significant and must be acknowledged. Nonetheless, the legislative process continues to erode the land rights of Indigenous and traditional communities.

“Many institutional actors involved in the legislative debates appear to agree on the need to simplify and accelerate environmental licensing. What we truly need is to accelerate the demarcation of Indigenous Lands and traditional territories.

“We will continue to assess the implications of this regulation, particularly in the cases we monitor closely, such as the Belo Sun and Brazil Potash mining projects in the Brazilian Amazon.”

As the IRA turns three, the law’s bigger lesson may be about political half-lives: Massive policy victories don’t always fade slowly.","Three years ago next Saturday, Democrats were celebrating what looked like a once-in-a-generation victory: President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, unlocking hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy and climate projects.

The idea behind the United States’ biggest-ever climate law wasn’t just to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Democrats hoped to secure long-term support for programs to boost production of clean cars and electricity and rebuild American manufacturing. Factories in states like Tennessee and Ohio would turn back U.S. reliance on China. Lawmakers of both parties would see jobs and money flow to their districts — and have a powerful incentive to keep the tide from ebbing.

Today, many of those hopes appear in tatters.

President Donald Trump is moving to reverse, rescind or repurpose as much IRA spending as he can, aided by a Republican Congress whose moderates have offered no meaningful resistance. He’s wielding every lever of power to promote a vision of economic growth based on tariffs, artificial intelligence and fossil fuels.

The speed of the political whiplash is a reminder of how quickly power can fade and seemingly historic achievements can be reversed. It also leaves Democrats pondering how — or whether — they could restore their policies if the 2028 election goes their way.

Real-life power switch

When the IRA passed in 2022, Democrats entered the upcoming campaign season buoyed by the victory. But, as it turned out, they had not cracked the more important puzzle: How do you sell a big, expensive policy to the American people?

FIRST: Then-candidate Donald Trump made repealing the IRA a central theme of his campaign. Democrats barely mentioned it.

In 2023, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer was betting that the Inflation Reduction Act would be a political asset for Democrats in 2024, embracing the law’s economic, health care and energy provisions as proof of delivering results. Yet when the election season came, Trump vowed to rescind any unspent IRA funds if reelected.

SECOND: Sending money to GOP districts hasn’t won political protection.

Democrats and industry allies believed the law’s widespread economic impact and job creation — especially in Republican-led areas — would make dismantling its incentives politically difficult, and even some Republicans agreed initially. In the end, that didn’t stop the GOP megabill from taking a “sledgehammer” to the act in July, aggressively terminating or phasing out many clean energy tax credits.

THIRD: The courts may not block reversals, even for funds under contract.

Trump’s vow to yank “unspent” IRA dollars is being tested in court. A ruling expected any day in a case involving the National Institutes of Health could determine whether recipients of climate-related IRA grants must go to federal claims court, which has limited authority. The venue change would further cement Trump’s power to cancel projects midstream.

As the IRA turns three, the law’s bigger lesson may be about political half-lives: Massive policy victories don’t always fade slowly. Sometimes, the switch flips fast.

Chinese solar panels hit U.S. border police

The Trump administration has increased enforcement of a trade law meant to keep solar cells made with Chinese forced labor out of the United States, Zack Colman reports.

A review of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data showed a sharp uptick since June of detentions of electronics, including solar cells and modules, under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. The crackdown is slowing the volume of cells produced in China that are making it to U.S. solar panel manufacturers.

U.S. border enforcement for the first time in June held up polysilicon from South Korea destined for manufacturing facilities owned by Qcells, a subsidiary of Korean firm Hanwha.

Climate change cancel culture

An emergency case at the Supreme Court could cast a ripple effect on cases involving federal funding for climate research, Jean Chemnick writes.

The case centers on the National Institutes of Health’s move to cancel research grants awarded to scientists and universities. It’s similar to the situation at the Environmental Protection Agency, where the agency is trying to reclaim funding awarded for a variety of climate projects.

Lawyers are looking for clues on how lower courts or the Supreme Court could rule on challenges to EPA grant terminations.

“It could come out in ways that are very important for the climate cases, and it could come out in ways that really don’t have a lot to do with the climate cases,” said David Super, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

Orphaned wells across America

The Interior Department has moved to cut environmental reviews to speed the cleanup of abandoned oil and gas wells, but attorneys warn it could open up states to litigation threats, Ian M. Stevenson writes.

The 2021 infrastructure law opened up $4.7 billion to help states plug and clean up orphaned wells. The grants were tied to standard environmental reviews, but Interior in July removed those reviews from the program.

Tens of thousands of abandoned wells exist across the United States, many of which send methane, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. There are around 120,000 documented orphaned wells nationwide, according to a 2023 release from the U.S. Geological Survey.

EPA proposes a robust step-change in biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel volumes beginning in 2026. The agency projects the requirement to reach 5.61 billion gallons in 2026 – more than two billion gallons higher than in 2025. According to an EPA fact sheet, “These volume requirements, if finalized, will protect investments made by American corn and soybean growers, oilseed processors, and biodiesel and renewable diesel producers, whose products are critical to our country’s energy security and keeping rural economies strong.”

“The proposal is a welcome signal to U.S. farmers and biofuel producers, and we are ready to meet these higher volumes with domestically produced fuel,” Clean Fuels writes in its comments. “We ask that the final rule sustain the volumes as proposed to ensure that our capacity is fully utilized. These volumes are readily achievable, based on current domestic production and investments that have been made.”

Clean fuel production is essential to farm security, supporting 10 percent of the value of every bushel of U.S. soybeans.”

“EPA is proposing many changes to the program and expressing the RVO in RIN-gallons rather than physical gallons,” Kovarik continued. “We ask that EPA follow through on its intent to support our industry’s investments in domestic fuel production by maintaining robust volumes even if some parts of the proposal are not finalized. We also urge EPA to ensure that the step-change in volumes is not eroded by small refinery exemptions.”

The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard.
According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023.
It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
“Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift.","Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.

The letter was sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.

This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter. According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023.

Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.

“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.

The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.

In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”

“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.

“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/birdiowapress-2048x1240.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 19:02:51.698545

A written statement from the department said that “termination of this program puts economic prosperity and energy security at risk for all North Carolinians.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a62ad9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x420+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb1%2F75%2F135de79c4f2cb0bf116da29f0fe0%2Funnamed-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 19:02:55.670179

Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States are collectively one of the largest contributors to climate pollution anywhere in the world.
EPA’s proposed finding that power plants do not “contribute significantly” to greenhouse gas emissions violates the law and common sense.","OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the California Air Resources Board today joined a coalition of 23 states and cities in submitting a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants and to eliminate the basis for those standards — the determination that power plant GHG emissions cause harmful climate change. The coalition asserts in its comments that these standards protect against increased emissions and further acceleration of climate change. The proposal, if finalized, could increase carbon dioxide pollution contributing to climate change by eliminating existing requirements for power plants to take steps to control their carbon dioxide emissions.

“Rolling back emission standards for dirty power plants jeopardizes critical progress at a time when it is most needed to confront the escalating impacts of climate change,” said Attorney General Bonta. “We’ve seen these impacts in California just this year with ravaging fires across Los Angeles. The EPA must stop ignoring the facts and immediately withdraw this reckless proposal.”

The EPA proposal includes a sweeping rollback of all GHG emission standards for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants. If finalized, the proposal would repeal both the 2015 New Source Performance Standards and the 2024 Carbon Pollution Standards, which limit carbon emissions from new natural gas-fired and existing coal-fired power plants. It would also rescind EPA’s 2015 finding that power plant GHG emissions significantly contribute to harmful climate change.

Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States are collectively one of the largest contributors to climate pollution anywhere in the world. Failing to control their carbon dioxide emissions will exacerbate significant threats facing California and Californians, intensifying and increasing heat waves, severe storms, flooding, disease, worsening air quality, and harming regional ecosystems. In the last year alone, California has experienced two of the most destructive fires in state history, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, both in Los Angeles County, with over 37,469 acres damaged, 30 deaths, multiple first responders injured, and over 16,251 structures destroyed.

In the comment letter, the coalition asserts that:

EPA’s proposed rule would significantly undermine efforts to address climate change and thus expose communities — particularly low-income and frontline communities — to greater environmental harm.

EPA’s proposed finding that power plants do not “contribute significantly” to greenhouse gas emissions violates the law and common sense.

The proposal arbitrarily and capriciously disregards effective measures plants can take to control their carbon dioxide emissions.

Despite unlawfully and illogically assuming reducing greenhouse gas emissions has zero benefit, EPA still admits that the rules it proposed to repeal are net beneficial to the American public.

At that time, Ford expected production and customer deliveries to begin in 2027.","This story has been updated to include more information about Ford and its EVs.

Ford Motor Co. plans to delay mass production of its new electric trucks at BlueOval City in Stanton until 2028, a company spokesperson confirmed.

The spokesperson said prototype builds remain on track to start at BlueOval City in 2027.

""We communicated timing adjustments for our next-gen electric van and electric full-size pickup to our suppliers and employees in June. F-150 Lightning, America's best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today's customer needs. We remain and will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability,"" Ford said in a statement. ""We look forward to telling you more about electric vehicle plans on Monday from Kentucky.""

The company is expected to make a big announcement on Aug. 11 at its plant in Louisville, Kentucky, outlining a future EV strategy. CEO Jim Farley has teased the announcement as being ""a Model T moment"" for the company, a reference to Ford's historic early car that helped build the 120-year company into a mass-market carmaker.

Ford has yet to make money on its EV sales. In fact, the automaker has projected it will lose up to $5.5 billion in its EV and software operations for 2025. In the second quarter, Ford reported its Model e electric vehicle unit lost $1.3 billion in the quarter, a wider loss than the $1.1 billion it lost in the year-ago period.

In addition to delaying the launch of the full-size electric pickup to be built at BlueOval City, Ford is delaying production of its E-transit van from 2026 to 2028. It is to be built at Ford's Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake, Ohio,

Delays at Ford's BlueOval City in West Tennessee

Ford’s $5.6 billion BlueOval City project is expected to create roughly 6,000 direct jobs through the Tennessee Electric Vehicle Center and BlueOval SK battery plant. Officials said BlueOval will produce thousands more indirect jobs, with the entire project projected to generate up to 30,000 direct and indirect jobs, according to officials.

In August 2024, Ford announced several changes to its electric vehicle strategy, including bumping back production of its next generation electric truck at BlueOval City. At that time, Ford expected production and customer deliveries to begin in 2027.

Ford told The Commercial Appeal the reason for that delay in production was because it wanted to use lower-cost battery technology. The hope was the battery technology would allow Ford to reduce costs and help make the Ford full-size EV pickup assembled at BlueOval City, as well as the company’s entire electric vehicle business, more profitable.

When the project was first announced in September 2021, production was originally expected to start in 2025.

During a tour in May, Ford said the buildings at BlueOval City are nearly complete, while equipment installation was underway and expected to be completed in 2026.

LITIGATION AND DISPUTES

Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Affirms FERC’s Decision to Deny Grid Incentive to PG&E

In a July 11, 2025, unpublished decision from a three-judge panel, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declined to disturb the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) decision to deny a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) request to include an incentive adder in its transmission rates designed to incent public utilities to join a regional transmission organization. It concluded that PG&E did not need an incentive to encourage it to participate in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), because California law already mandates participation. California law mandates that utilities “shall participate” in CAISO, and because members cannot withdraw from CAISO, “their participation is not voluntary.” The court also rejected PG&E’s contention that federal law preempts section 362(c) of the California Public Utilities Code, the rule mandating CAISO participation. California’s CAISO mandate regulates within a domain that Congress assigned to the states in a way that “indirectly affects interstate wholesale rates.” These “indirect effects do not trigger field preemption.”

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

On July 21, 2025, FERC approved a fast-track interconnection proposal from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO). In proposing the process, MISO emphasized the necessity for bringing power supplies online quickly to meet near-term grid needs. State utility commissions or other “relevant electric retail regulatory authorities” would assess potential projects being considered in MISO’s review process. State regulators mostly supported the proposal, but renewable-energy companies and public-interest groups criticized FERC’s approval arguing, in part, that the proposal violates FERC’s principles of providing nondiscriminatory access to the grid. Furthermore, critics argued, the proposal could disrupt development for projects waiting in interconnection queues. The approved proposal will allow planned resources meeting certain eligibility requirements to sidestep MISO’s standard interconnection-queue reviews. Critics contend that gas-fired power plants will be the main beneficiaries of the fast-track process.

State Utility Regulators Ask FERC to Reject MISO’s $21.8 Billion Transmission-development Plan

In a complaint filed on July 30, 2025, state utility regulators from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and North Dakota have requested that FERC reject MISO’s $21.8 billion transmission-development plan, contending that MISO overstated the benefits and underestimated the costs associated with the latest tranche of its Multi-Value Project (MVP) program. MVPs are transmission projects MISO has identified as having regional economic, reliability, or public-policy benefits that are, therefore, eligible to have their costs shared across MISO’s footprint. The latest MVP tranche contains 24 transmission projects covering more than 3,600 miles of MISO’s Midwest subregion. MISO claims its benefits could exceed $72 billion. The complaining states contend that MISO used unreasonable metrics overstating the benefits of the latest MVP projects. They further contend that the MVP projects impose unreasonable costs by allowing states with more aggressive clean-energy goals to shift transmission costs to states that do not share those same goals or that have decided to build their renewable and other resources closer to load.

David LaCerte to fill FERC Vacancy

On July 16, 2025, President Donald Trump named David LaCerte, an official from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to fill a vacant position at FERC. LaCerte has served as the principal White House liaison and senior advisor of OPM, which serves as the primary human-resources agency for the federal government, since January 2025. He also served as acting Managing Director of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board at the end of President Trump’s first term in office. LaCerte was special counsel at Baker Botts for two years beginning in January 2023, where he worked on energy litigation and environmental, safety, and incident-response issues. If confirmed, LaCerte would serve the remainder of former FERC Chair Willie Phillips’ term that expires June 30, 2026, and he would break a 2-2 tie and give Republicans a 3-2 FERC majority.

Administrative Law Judge recommends that the Minnesota PUC to Reject $6.2 Billion Private Equity Deal

On July 15, 2025, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Megan McKenzie recommended that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) reject a $6.2 billion private-equity deal. Under the deal, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Blackrock’s Global Infrastructure Partners would buy Allete, parent company of Minnesota Power and Superior Water, Light and Power. In a recommended decision, ALJ McKenzie concluded that the deal does not meet Minnesota’s public-interest standard and poses foreseeable risks to Minnesota’s energy transition, Allete’s long-term financial health, and ratepayers. Allete and its buyers, she stated, failed to adequately support primary arguments for supporting the deal, including improving access to capital and expertise. Allete criticized the recommendation, contending that ALJ McKenzie did not fully consider the benefits of a July 11, 2025, settlement agreement with the Minnesota Department of Commerce, in which Minnesota Power would freeze its base rates for one year and reduce its return on equity from 9.78% to 9.65% until a future rate case. Allete contended that this reduction would provide immediate ratepayer benefits. However, ALJ Mckenize cited September 2024 warnings from “FERC that asset managers like Blackrock could hurt ratepayers by trying to maximize profits from utilities their portfolios, concluding that “[o]n balance, the risks of the deal, as proposed, outweigh the possible benefits.”

Executive Order Tightens Restrictions on Wind and Solar Development

On July 7, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order curtailing federal subsidies on wind, solar, and electric vehicles. The order states that renewables have distorted markets, undermined grid reliability and national security by reliance on foreign-controlled supply chains, and imposed unsustainable costs on taxpayer. The order instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to publish guidance within 45 days “to ensure the policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented” by wind and solar projects whose eligibility for clean-energy tax credits were significantly reduced in the July 4, 2025, budget legislation. The legislation restricts the ability of renewables projects to qualify for the 48E investment tax credit or the 45Y production tax credit, shortens the timeline for those credits, and terminates residential-solar and electric-vehicle tax credits by the beginning of 2026. The order directs the Treasury to strictly enforce the termination of these credits and to focus on closing perceived loopholes in “beginning of construction” definitions and safe-harbor provisions that may otherwise be used to lock-in benefits through minimal pre-development work. Treasury must also implement the Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the budget legislation to ensure that projects with ownership, financing, or supply-chain links to specified foreign states are ineligible for clean-energy credits.

Ohio Regulators Approve AEP Data Center Interconnection Rules

The Ohio Public Utilities Commission (OPUC) unanimously approved a July 9, 2025, settlement agreement between AEP Ohio and various stakeholders setting new terms and conditions for connecting data centers to the power grid. The OPUC ordered AEP Ohio to file updated tariffs and to lift a moratorium on connecting new data centers. The order sets minimum monthly bills for new data centers larger than 24 MW based on a percentage of their highest previous monthly billing demand over the past eleven months or their contract capacity. Those data centers will need to pay for at least 85% of the energy they expect to need each month, even if they use less, to cover the costs associated with infrastructure needed to bring electricity to the facilities. The order also requires data centers to show that they are financially viable and to pay an exit fee if their project is cancelled. The Ohio Consumers Council, which represents ratepayers; the Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy; and others supported the agreement. The Data Center Coalition—an industry group representing, among others, Google, Amazon, Microsoft—opposed the agreement, contending that it would dampen investment by inflating data centers’ costs and imposing unnecessary regulation on behind-the-meter energy generation.

Michigan’s Palisades Nuclear Power Plant Closer to Restarting after Recent NRC Approvals

On July 24, 2025, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) granted multiple approved needed for the 800-MW Palisades Nuclear Power Plant (Palisades) in Michigan to restart later this year. The former owner, Entergy, shut the plant down in May 2022 and sold it to Holtec in June 2022. Holtec began plans to restart Palisades in late 2023. With NRC’s decision, Holtec is now authorized to receive new fuel and to formally transition licensed reactor operators to on-shift status. In May, NRC concluded that Holtec’s efforts to restart Palisades poses “no significant impact” to human health or the environment. NRC noted that there are still several licensing actions under review, and additional requirements will need to be met before Palisades can begin producing under the original operating license, which expires March 24, 2031.

FERC Rejects Petition to Limit Market Monitor’s Transmission Planning Oversight

On July 18, 2025, FERC rejected a petition from MISO and its transmission owners calling for MISO’s independent market monitor to be effectively barred from transmission-planning oversight. FERC’s petition followed the market monitor’s (Potomac Economics) criticism of MISO’s needs and cost-benefit analysis supporting its $22 billion Tranche 2.1 transmission portfolio that FERC approved in December 2024. Potomac Economics contended that MISO overstated its transmission needs and the benefits flowing from its proposed project portfolio. In rejecting the request, FERC emphasized that MISO’s tariff “unambiguously” authorizes MISO’s market monitor to review and analyze MISO’s actions affecting the competitiveness, economic efficiency, and operation of the grid operator’s markets and services, and transmission planning is among those actions subject to review.

Oregon Legislature Approves First-in-Nation Microgrid Framework

To improve grid reliability and combat rising energy costs, the Oregon House of Representatives and Senate passed two bills designed to make communities more resilient as the state’s grid faces rising electricity demand, extreme weather events, and power shutoffs to mitigate wildfire risk. Governor Tina Kotek signed the bills on July 17, 2025. HB 2065 seeks to reduce bottlenecks to microgrid deployment by allowing third-party consultants or contractors to evaluate customer requests to connect to the public power grid and by requiring public utilities to approve or deny microgrid applications “based on safety, reliability and compliance with published standards.” HB 2066 directs the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) to develop a regulatory framework for community-owned and private microgrids. It also requires the Department of Consumer and Building Services to establish rules allowing existing buildings to connect to community microgrids and allows local governments to design “microgrid zones” with special land-use regulations, subject to local utility or OPUC. Community microgrids combine individually owned solar, batteries, and other energy-generation or -storage systems located at facilities that have high reliability or “uptime” needs, such as hospitals, schools, police and fire stations, wastewater-treatment plants, critical infrastructure facilities, data centers, grocery stores, and other businesses.

DOE Retracts $4.9 Billion Conditional Loan Commitment to Grain Belt Express

On July 23, 2025, the Department of Energy (DOE) revoked its conditional commitment to a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the first phase of the Grain Belt Express, a transmission line proposed to traverse parts of Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana. DOE stated that the conditions needed to issue the loan guarantee were unlikely to be met and that federal support for the 5,000-MW direct current transmission line is not critical. Grain Belt Express had argued that the 800-mile, open-access transmission line would increase grid reliability and significantly reduce energy costs for ratepayers. In response, DOE stated that the conditional commitment was among those “rushed out the door” at the end of the Biden Administration.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15401_555.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 20:59:03.033280

Send tips | Subscribe | Email Sophia | Email Irie | Email Ben

In the months since President DONALD TRUMP returned to office, a little-known but deeply influential body inside the White House has been quietly driving one of Trump’s biggest policy ambitions: Making the United States “energy dominant” by providing affordable, reliable energy to Americans while still generating enough electricity to power the boom in artificial intelligence.

This Energy Dominance Council, first announced in November with Interior Secretary DOUG BURGUM as director and Energy Secretary CHRIS WRIGHT as deputy, is modeled after the national security and economic councils. It is tasked with coordinating the federal government — from the Department of Energy to the Department of Agriculture to the State Department — toward achieving those goals.

The goal is to expedite projects, said RICHARD GOLDBERG, the senior counselor who helped conceive of and stood up the council. The council has been working with private enterprise to dramatically reduce the time it takes to get a project off the ground — from years, he said, to days.

It’s part of a larger administration drive to cut the red tape it believes stymies innovation.

But environmental groups and renewable energy executives have taken the White House to task for refusing to include wind and solar power projects, two of the fastest and cheapest ways to increase energy production, in their energy dominance plans. That approach could haunt the administration, critics warn, as electricity prices rise, in part because of the high demand for power from the data centers used to fuel AI.

Trump’s focus on keeping oil prices down could also cause the White House to stumble on the president’s promise to boost production — oil companies are laying off employees and the number of barrels the United States is producing is starting to fall after reaching a record high in March.

West Wing Playbook sat down with Goldberg to discuss the council’s mission, structure, and how it’s navigating the challenge of meeting America’s growing energy demand. He just wrapped up his service as a special government employee.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Let’s start with the big picture. What is the Energy Dominance Council, and how does it work inside the White House?

It’s the first time in history that we’ve created a dedicated energy dominance council that is tasked with carrying out the president’s objectives to make America energy dominant. That means everything that is required to have enough energy to provide reliable and affordable energy for all Americans, have enough energy to win the AI arms race against China, have a US-led energy supply chain that hooks allies to the United States and unhooks people from our adversaries, and having enough energy to promote peace stability while managing threats and having maximum flexibility in times of conflict.

How is the council structured? Who’s actually doing the day-to-day work?

The council is less than 10 very committed patriotic Americans working out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. It’s run by an executive director who’s a deputy assistant to the president, and supported by two deputies who are special assistants to the president. They are managing projects on a daily basis.

We have a dedicated policy lead just working oil and gas issues all day long. There’s a policy lead working on power issues and all that power encompasses, and that includes nuclear power, coal power and electricity to power AI and what that means as far as maintaining and preserving, strengthening the grid today. A policy lead on mining and critical minerals was a very important addition that the president made to the council’s mandate.

How are you executing on that vision for the president?

The message is the Energy Dominance Council is open for business. You just have to call and say, you have a project, you have something that we’re working on that is a new build, a new mine, a new dig, a new connection, a new pipeline, a new export terminal, you name it, and that it will contribute to energy dominance in the following ways. It will make sure we are adding reliable baseload energy to our grid in the following ways.

This is the focal point of the entire U.S. government to say, what do you need from the U.S. government to make your project happen in 14 or 28 days instead of five or 10 years or 30 years? Is it permitting assistance? Is it financing assistance? Is it other regulatory reviews that have become so burdensome over many years?

What financing tools are available to companies seeking federal support?

The Energy Department’s loan program is well known, but there’s also the Department of Defense’s defense production authorities, the Export-Import Bank, the Development Finance Corporation and others. The council helps projects navigate this web. We’ve also ramped up investment in critical minerals, including taking the unprecedented step of having the U.S. government take equity in strategic mining projects like Mountain Pass [the only operating rare-earth mine in the United States].

What’s the Council’s emergency plan if we do see energy prices spike or grid failures this summer?

We’re working to prevent that from happening in the first place. There are only two major reasons why that might happen right now. One is you keep closing down coal plants that are keeping the grid stable in certain areas of high demand, you have states that just keep pushing forward on wind and solar with state support of some kind and connecting it to the grid and making their grid over reliant on it. Or you have one of these hyper scalers try to connect into an existing grid with just more power needs than you know could possibly happen.

But the president is not going to allow that to happen, I’m very confident. If he sees any knuckleheads getting in the way that could cause it to happen, he’s going to look at any possible authority that he has to break the log jam.

In the event that energy prices do spike, do you think the administration would review its stance on wind and solar?

I think it’s important to understand that we have been put on a trajectory, on the grid and on prices by policy decisions made for many years embracing intermittent and unreliable sources of energy. And so when we start seeing stress in the grid today, this is a grid that the president inherited.

I understand the political strategy from the wind and solar industry to look at an immediate moment of crisis or a rise in price or anything like that that could ever happen and say, ‘Oh, it’s because you’re de-prioritizing wind and solar.’ That’s not why it’s happening, and it’s not the solution, we will absolutely see higher prices and grid failures if we reverse course. We need heavy baseload energy pumped into the grid to not just win the air arms race, but keep the lights on today.

I’ve heard some buzz recently on geothermal. Where is the administration on this form of energy?

It has potential. DOE is looking at this and working on this. It is absolutely part of the council’s mandate and focus. You know, we just finished putting the finishing touches on having a challenge coin for the council and geothermal is represented on the coin.

Europe promised to spend $750 billion over three years on purchases of U.S. energy. Does the U.S. have enough oil, gas and other energy commodities to meet that price tag?

The answer is we have availability of supply today to increase sales abroad, increase exports across Europe and the Asia Pacific as well. And we have a supply curve that will continue to increase over the years ahead to both provide for the U.S. consumer and the increased demand that we’re seeing across the globe for us. We need to continue to build out both the export infrastructure and help our potential customers abroad make sure that they’re building out their infrastructure for import facilities and floating regasification units. We have American companies involved in all of that that can help.

RUIN THE BRUINS: The White House is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, our JUAN PEREZ JR. reports. The move comes after the administration last week froze nearly $600 million in funding to the school.

University of California President JAMES B. MILLIKEN said in a statement the school was reviewing the proposal but that a settlement of that size would “devastate” the university.

SELL SELL SELL?: Trump is considering selling stock in mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac later this year, our KATHERINE HAPGOOD reports. The details of a potential public offering would value the two companies at around $500 billion and involve selling 5 to 15 percent of their stock. It is unclear whether Fannie and Freddie will remain under government conservatorship.

“The president is weighing all his options,” a senior administration official said today. The Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

EDITED HISTORY: The Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History today revealed an updated version of its impeachment exhibit that now includes context about Trump’s impeachments, WaPo’s JANAY KINGSBERRY and MAURA JUDKIS report. The change comes after a placard with Trump’s name was removed from the exhibit following a Smithsonian review of the museum’s content prompted by the White House.

“The updated display now reflects all presidential impeachments,” the Smithsonian said in a statement. “Adhering to principles foundational to our role as the nation’s museum, we take great care to ensure that what we present to the public reflects both intellectual integrity and thoughtful design.”

WHO'S IN, WHO'S OUT

ANOTHER IRS SHAKEUP: Trump is replacing his Internal Revenue Service commissioner just two months into his tenure, Nicole and our BRIAN FALER report. BILLY LONG is expected to instead be named to an ambassadorship.

It is unclear who will next lead the IRS, which has had six different leaders this year. Treasury Secretary SCOTT BESSENT will serve as the agency’s acting commissioner, said the White House official, who was granted anonymity to discuss personnel moves.

Knives Out

EASIER SAID THAN DONE: The MAGA movement is escalating its calls to arrest Trump’s opponents, from the Texas Democrats who bolted from the state to derail a redistricting vote to former President BARACK OBAMA. But those screaming the loudest appear likely to wind up disappointed, our KYLE CHENEY reports.

It’s a familiar refrain for Trump’s second term: The far right lusts to see prominent Democrats or Trump adversaries hauled off in handcuffs, only to be let down when their revenge fantasies run into reality.

“They voted for that and now they realize they can’t have retribution because it’s not legally sound,” said GENE ROSSI, a white collar criminal defense lawyer who spent three decades at the Justice Department.

SWISH SWISH, TISH: Speaking of political retribution, the U.S. attorney’s office in Albany has issued at least two subpoenas to New York Attorney General LETITIA JAMES in recent days, our NICK REISMAN, JOSH GERSTEIN and ERICA ORDEN report.

The subpoenas are an escalation of the Trump administration’s scrutiny of James, who has positioned herself as a ferocious opponent of the president. One is focused on James’ successful civil fraud case against Trump’s businesses. The second stems from her high-profile fraud case against the National Rifle Association.

In the Courts

NOT SO FAST: A federal appeals court panel today threw out U.S. District Judge JAMES BOASBERG’s bid to pursue criminal contempt for Trump administration officials he says defied his orders in March by sending 130 Venezuelan men to a prison in El Salvador, Kyle and Josh report.

D.C. Circuit Judges GREGORY KATSAS and NEOMI RAO — both Trump appointees — overturned an order Boasberg issued in April initiating the potential contempt proceedings. The ruling can be appealed further. But if it remains in place, it appears to sharply diminish — but not completely rule out — the possibility that lawyers or other officials in the administration could face contempt charges over their conduct during the high-profile deportation showdown.

GM will buy lithium-iron-phosphate batteries from China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., the Wall Street Journal first reported Thursday and a source close to the matter confirmed to The Detroit News on Friday.

Ford Motor Co. also has an agreement to license technology from the Chinese battery giant for a multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan, a deal that has faced some political backlash.

""For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,"" according to a GM statement. ""To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model. We’re proud that we sell 12 EVs in the U.S. using domestically-produced battery cells, and in 2027 we will bring LFP production to the U.S, further cementing our unique and resilient US-based supply chain.""

The deal highlights the difficulties U.S. manufacturers face to onshore production in response to President Donald Trump's tariffs.

GM last month unveiled a plan to produce lithium-iron-phosphate batteries in Tennessee in partnership with LG Energy Solution. But production of those EV batteries, which are cheaper to make because of higher iron content, is not expected to begin until 2027.

In the meantime, GM is willing to pay import taxes in exchange for more affordable batteries to go in the redesigned Bolt, a cult favorite discontinued in 2023. The new Bolt is scheduled to begin production late this year at GM's Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas.

GM introduced its Bolt to the market in late 2016 and began selling the larger Bolt EUV in 2021. In 2021, the automaker had to recall all Bolts for battery fire risk as the result of manufacturing defects.

Analysts say a key to EV adoption in the United States is affordability, as most EVs are priced at several thousand dollars more than gas-powered counterparts.

The funding is being arranged in collaboration with SBM Bank.

In 2023, Qair signed four power purchase agreements (PPAs) totaling 60MWac with Mauritius’ state-owned utility, the Central Electricity Board (CEB). The agreements covered the development of four Stor’Sun solar farms, each equipped with BESS, across multiple sites in the country. The total investment in the projects was estimated to exceed MUR7 billion (US$150 million).

The remaining two plants, including the Stor’Sun III solar farm, were planned for construction in Balaclava in the Pamplemousses district. The fourth plant was set to be developed in Petite-Rivière, located in the Rivière Noire district.

Expanding its footprint in the Indian Ocean, Qair entered the Mauritian market in 2008. It currently operates a 10MW wind farm in Plaine des Roches and solar parks totaling 25.3MW in capacity.

According to the firm, the newly secured financing will enable the company to move forward with implementation, supporting Mauritius’ goal of achieving 60% renewable energy in its electricity mix by 2030.

Currently, Qair has 1.7GW of capacity in operation and is developing a 34GW pipeline across 20 countries in Europe, Latin America and Africa. In addition to Mauritius, the company is active in Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Morocco and Seychelles. Qair currently operates 65MW in Africa, has 154MW under financing, and is developing over 2GW in new projects.

CREC raises US$77 million for 125MWp solar project in Philippines

Philippine renewable energy developer Citicore Renewable Energy Corporation (CREC) has secured a PHP 4.4 billion (US$77 million) project finance loan for its 125MWp Citicore Solar Pangasinan project in Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan.

Citicore Solar Pangasinan is a key project in CREC’s goal to install 5GW within five years. Currently under construction, it has received a Certificate of Energy Project of National Significance (CEPNS) from the Department of Energy (DOE), helping to fast-track its completion by year-end.

Located in Sta. Barbara, Citicore Solar Pangasinan is one of three CREC projects in the province. The others are Citicore Solar Pangasinan II in Binalonan, which is under construction, and Citicore Wind Pangasinan, currently in early development. All three secured 20-year offtake contracts with the Philippine government through the DOE’s Green Energy Auction Program (GEAP)-2 in 2023.

The funding was provided in partnership with Security Bank Corporation and Security Bank Capital Investment Corporation.

San Juan City, Philippines-based CREC has a total operating solar capacity of 285MW across ten solar power plants. In the Philippine renewable energy sector, the firm aims to significantly expand its solar capacity to 2.56GW by 2026.

Greenalia secures US$50 million to boost US PV pipeline

Spanish renewables developer Greenalia has secured a US$50 million increase to its existing three-year credit facilities to support the expansion of its solar and wind project pipeline in the US.

The additional funding was provided by Korean investors IMM Investment Hong Kong and NH Investment & Securities to Greenalia Power US Advanced II, a Greenalia subsidiary focused on utility-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects in the US.

The US$50 million upsizing will support Greenalia’s 1.9GWdc ERCOT portfolio by financing project equipment, backing letters of credit and covering other development and construction costs. This expanded facility follows positive momentum around Greenalia’s first US asset, the 430MWdc Misae II solar project. Greenalia recently secured US$388 million in senior project financing for Misae II from MUFG and Nomura.

PEI Global Partners served as financial advisor to Greenalia, with Holland & Knight as borrower’s counsel. Norton Rose Fulbright represented the lenders. Nomura Securities International remains the lead arranger, while Nomura Corporate Funding Americas continues as administrative agent for the facilities.

BRUC renews €650 million debt to advance 6.6GW projects in Spain

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.
“With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.
“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read.
The Solar for All fund was meant to bring the benefits of solar power to 900,000 households in low-income communities, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","Several congressional Democrats on Friday slammed the Trump administration’s announcement it will cancel nearly $7 billion in grants to fund solar energy projects for low-income households, saying the move was illegal and would raise families’ energy prices if allowed to proceed.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sent notices to states and other recipients of grants through the Solar for All program, which Democrats created in their massive 2022 taxes, energy and domestic policy law, that the agency was canceling all unspent funds from the initiative.

The EPA said Republicans eliminated the federal fund that distributed the program’s money in the “one big, beautiful” law President Donald Trump signed on July 4.

On Thursday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on social media the law terminated the agency’s legal ability to distribute the funds.

“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the one big, beautiful bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”

The move sparked a backlash from Democrats in Congress and the states, who said that rescinding the already-obligated funding violated the law.

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program,” the five Democratic members of Oregon’s congressional delegation wrote in a Friday letter to Zeldin and White House Budget Director Russell Vought.

“Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.”

Letters to 60 states, organizations

The 60 recipients of the grant awards, mostly state governments but also tribes and some multistate projects, received letters from the EPA on Thursday informing them the grants were being cancelled.

The letter sent to Oregon’s Department of Energy said the reconciliation bill Trump signed on July 4 rescinded the authorization and appropriations for the fund.

“Any attempt to continue the program’s administration, in the absence of any authorizing legislation or appropriated funds for that purpose, is no longer legally permissible,” the letter said.

“The EPA has been weighing options for the future of the Solar for All program and has made the decision to terminate the SFA program and existing grants because the EPA no longer has a statutory basis or dedicated funding to continue administering and overseeing the nearly $7 billion outlay to approximately 60 grant recipients.”

The letter said the EPA realized that recipients “may have begun to rely” on the program for preliminary budgeting and staffing decisions. But it said that “due to the early nature of such expenditures, we expect any harms to interests suffered to be remedied and remediable.”

In a statement Friday, the Oregon Department of Energy said it had already spent “significant administrative funds” to launch the program later this year, and hinted a legal challenge may come soon.

“The federal funding has already been obligated to Oregon, and the Oregon Solar for All Coalition,” the department statement read. “We are surprised and disappointed to hear the U.S. EPA is moving to rescind these already-obligated funds. ODOE will work with our partners, the Governor’s Office, and Oregon’s Attorney General to consider next steps to ensure these funds continue to serve Oregonians as intended.”

‘A betrayal’

Like the Oregon Democrats, New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone, the ranking member on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the move was illegal and predicted it would raise energy prices.

“The Trump Administration is stealing from working families in broad daylight,” Pallone said in an early Friday statement. “This money was intended for our constituents and communities to help lower energy bills. Clawing these funds back isn’t just brazenly illegal – it’s a betrayal by this Administration of working families who will now pay higher energy bills just so Republicans can grind their axe against clean energy.”

Other Democrats, including Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, also focused on the economic impact.

“President Trump ran on lowering costs and creating jobs,” Hobbs wrote on X. “Gutting Solar for All will do the exact opposite. It makes our air dirtier, our energy bills higher, and our economy weaker. I will continue to fight for the clean and affordable energy future Arizonans want and deserve.”

Democrats created the Solar for All fund as part of the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the law they passed without any GOP support in either chamber and President Joe Biden signed in August 2022.

In communication with the federal government, Louisiana's energy department had earlier stressed how the program to generate 112 megawatts of solar power would positively impact the state.
This would mean that people could typically still power their homes at night, on dark days or during outages through stored solar energy.","Louisiana is set to lose $156 million in funding for solar energy after the Trump administration's move to eliminate the program, a blow to efforts to improve electricity reliability and affordability in a state with some of the nation's most outages, local officials say.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency canceled the $7 billion program on Thursday that aimed to lower utility costs for nearly a million people across the country. Louisiana's $156 million grant had already been awarded to the state, which planned to use it to expand access to renewable energy for low-income and disadvantaged families as well as help safeguard residents when storms knock out power.

For state officials involved in planning the program – called Solar for All at the federal level, and Solar for Y’all in Louisiana – the news of the cut came in the form of a social media post from EPA administrator Lee Zeldin.

Zeldin wrote on X Thursday afternoon that the agency no longer has the authority to administer or appropriate the funds “to keep this boondoggle alive” under the One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. The tax and spending law cut the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that was approved under former President Joe Biden’s signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act. The solar program came out of this larger fund.

The EPA formally notified the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources, which was awarded the solar grant in April 2024, that the program was cut Thursday evening, according to DENR spokesperson Patrick Courreges.

“Congress has made its intent clear – via a repeal of the statutory authorization and all appropriated funding for the program and the administrative burdens of implementing and overseeing the program – that the [Solar for All] program is no longer to operate,” states the termination letter from the EPA, shared with The Times-Picayune.

Courreges said that in the absence of the funding, the state will “look for other opportunities, federal or otherwis,e for energy resilience.”

The Center for Planning Excellence, a Baton Rouge-based organization that crafted Louisiana's Solar for All program with the state, stressed the economic benefits that the solar program would have delivered to lower-income populations.

""Louisianans are already rightfully upset about their energy bills – they are high, getting higher, and already unaffordable for many,” said CPEX President Camille Manning-Broome. “Electricity is becoming a luxury in Louisiana – while residents in states generating solar are getting money back.”

She lauded the now-terminated program as a way to address affordability and grid resilience in a state with one of the nation's highest electricity cost burdens. The federal Solar for All program guaranteed that participating low-income residents would see 20% reductions in household bills.

'A betrayal'

Around 15,000 Louisiana households were expected to benefit from the program, generating around $4.6 million in savings, Manning-Broome said.

“Louisiana people need our state leadership to protect this investment that is critical to meeting current energy needs, maintaining economic competitiveness, and powering our future,” she said.

U.S. Rep Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, said in a statement that the EPA decision “may be illegal.”

“Cutting these grants is a betrayal,” he said. “It hurts working families, our environment, and our shared future.”

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, Gov. Jeff Landry, and U.S. Senators Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment.

States with Democratic leadership and other organizations across the country are signaling they will fight the EPA termination in the coming days, arguing that the president lacks the authority to rescind money appropriated by Congress and already obligated to state agencies. All of the $156 million awarded to Louisiana has been obligated.

In communication with the federal government, Louisiana's energy department had earlier stressed how the program to generate 112 megawatts of solar power would positively impact the state.

""Louisiana is in a unique position nationally to demonstrate how to reduce its high greenhouse gas inventory through the incorporation of solar energy while addressing its historic social and economic inequities,"" DENR said in its February 2025 workplan application to the EPA.

The program had not started rolling out yet, as the state was waiting for approval from the EPA.

Extreme risk in Louisiana

DENR's plan notes the state's frequent extreme weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, drought, wildfires and high heat. Projected sea level rise contributes to elevated flood risk and quicker coastal land loss. On top of these risks, DENR's application describes the slew of outages that strain vulnerable residents.

""In 2021, the average customer in Louisiana experienced more than 80 hours of power outages during the year due to the weather, by far the highest in the country,"" the plan continues. ""The disadvantaged communities of Louisiana will continue to experience the devastating impacts of hazardous weather without the means to evacuate or invest in energy resilience options.""

Solar for All sought to address these concerns through a range of programs for eligible low-income homeowners and renters. This included residential solar for single-family units and small multi-family apartments, with no upfront costs and a minimum of 20% in savings. Battery storage grants were planned to complement the residential solar installations to reduce grid dependence and increase household resiliency.

This would mean that people could typically still power their homes at night, on dark days or during outages through stored solar energy.

According to the DENR application, the program also opened a new pathway for ""community solar,"" a system designed for renters or others who can't install solar on their properties. Residents can subscribe to a share of a solar farm located elsewhere and receive a credit on their electric bills. The program anticipated supporting up to 8,600 households across the state through community solar.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/7d/67da3127-5e2d-4ee4-90fc-04b83cb644a2/68518e79c0144.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-08 19:03:23.321505

Utility commissions across the nation are “broken” and must be reformed to stop rising electric costs, a coalition of lawmakers, consumer and environmental advocates said Tuesday during a joint press conference.

Speakers at the press conference said it seemed likely that the Florida Public Service Commission would “rubber stamp” a $9.8 billion base rate increase proposed by Florida Power & Light, and argued that regulators have become too deferential to utility requests.

U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., reintroduced legislation on Tuesday that would prohibit utility companies from using ratepayer dollars to fund political lobbying and advertising.

Dive Insight:

What started as a Tuesday morning press conference drawing attention to the plight of Floridians struggling to pay rising electric bills quickly escalated to calls for legislative reforms of utility commissions across the nation.

“When we have a public service commission that does not look out for the best interest of the customers but rather the utility company itself, there is a problem,” Zayne Smith, senior director of advocacy at AARP Florida, said. “This is a canary in the coal mine if the current ask is granted.”

Advocates on the call argued that FPL’s request to increase base rates by 2.5% would harm Florida residents who are already struggling to pay their bills amid other rising costs. Hearings in the case are set to begin this month.

Documents obtained during the rate case discovery period suggest that up to a fifth of FPL customers had their power shut off between March 2024 and February 2025 due to unpaid bills, according to Bradley Marshall, an Earthjustice attorney who is representing Florida Rising, the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida in the upcoming rate case proceedings.

While FPL argues that the increase would maintain base rates 20% below the national average, Marshall said those figures don’t take additional charges like storm recovery fees into account. Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for Food & Water Watch, said their research suggests the proposed rate would increase the average FPL customer’s electric bills by $360 per year.

Rising rates have also caused conflict at the Florida Public Service Commission, Ward said. For much of the past decade, most rate cases ended in settlements, Marshall said. But Earthjustice has appealed Tampa Electric’s most recent general rate case to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that the Florida Public Service Commission ignored the advice of its own staff when it approved the new rate. The Florida Office of Public Counsel has also appealed the Tampa Electric rate case.

MacKenzie Marcelin, climate justice director at Florida Rising, characterized the Florida PSC’s actions as “rubber stamping” utility requests with little explanation or accountability to the public.

“The public service commission is broken...we urgently need legislative reform,” Ward said, adding that reforms at the state and federal levels could create more transparency, tie utilities’ profit to their performance on matters such as energy efficiency, and hold utilities accountable for fuel spikes and other drivers of rising electric bills.

“We should rename the public service commission to utility service commission, because more often than not they serve the electric utilities rather than the public,” Rep. Castor said.

Castor said she believes utility commissions around the country have been swayed by lobbying efforts from the utilities they regulate. The Ethics in Energy Act, she said, would bar utilities from including expenses such as political lobbying and advertising in base rates — ensuring ratepayers are not charged for these activities and reducing their influence on utility regulators.

“We can no longer stand idly by, allowing these energy companies to profit off hardworking Americans,” she said. “Not here in Florida, and not anywhere else.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/rtFEaQStbv76l3TpVPQ4qQ_4wVW5cLvda5ul0WtAakk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9LYXRoeV9DYXN0b3IuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-08 18:03:22.067703

Ohio Capital Journal

After six years and more than a half billion dollars in consumer costs, Ohio utility customers will no longer have to subsidize two 1950s-era coal plants, one of which is in Indiana.

A new law that takes effect on August 14 officially eliminates the coal subsidies created by House Bill 6, the 2019 nuclear and coal bailout law at the heart of Ohio’s ongoing utility-corruption saga.

Despite the Trump administration’s push to keep polluting coal plants open, their electricity is generally less competitive than alternatives such as combined-cycle gas, solar energy, and wind power. These two coal plants in particular are often among the most expensive options available in the grid region serving Ohio, and yet have run anyway.

Lawmakers repealed HB 6’s nuclear bailout less than a year after the corruption scandal became public, with the arrests of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and others in 2020, but multiple bills to repeal the coal plant subsidies failed. It wasn’t until HB 15 passed in May that lawmakers finally agreed to end the mandated payments — at least for the 5 million customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities.

Since 2001, customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities have had the option to choose their electricity supplier, and utilities have generally been banned from favoring or subsidizing related generation comp anies.

Starting in 2013, however, Ohio utility companies began seeking ratepayer-funded bailouts for the two old coal plants — the Kyger Creek plant, in Cheshire, Ohio, and the Clifty Creek plant, in Madison, Indiana — owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, or OVEC. OVEC’s shareholders are parent companies of Ohio’s regulated utilities.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, or PUCO, let some utilities begin collecting charges in 2017, but those orders faced challenges. Two years later, HB 6 guaranteed those payments through 2030.

The subsidy cutoff comes none too soon, according to an August 4 analysis prepared by RunnerStone for the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association. Ohio utility customers could have paid over $413 million more through 2030. As things stand, the HB 6 subsidies plus earlier payments under challenged regulatory orders total more than $683 million, the analysis shows.

“Instead of propping up shareholders, this money should have gone to help Ohio’s families pay for needed items like groceries, health care, and other essentials,” said Maureen Willis, who serves as Ohio Consumers’ Counsel. As she sees it, ​“ending the coal plant subsidies is long overdue.”

Yet, controversy continues over whether large chunks of the charges were reasonable and prudent, as required by Ohio law.

One case at the Ohio Supreme Court deals with amounts collected in 2018 and 2019. Another appeal challenges the PUCO’s approval of charges in 2020 under HB 6. Both cases are waiting for the Ohio Supreme Court to schedule oral argument.

The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group, and the Ohio Environmental Council, and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel are challenging the utilities’ decision to pass along the costs of running the old coal plants full tilt even when it was uneconomical, among other things.

Challengers in the HB 6 case argue that the PUCO rulings improperly presumed that the coal plant charges were lawful, instead of making the utilities prove it. The commission then limited challengers’ ability to show that the costs for running the plants during poor market conditions failed to meet statutory requirements, they say.

The case for the 2018 and 2019 charges also includes an argument that the commission improperly influenced an independent audit. For instance, a commission staff member asked the auditor to ​“tone down” a draft report saying that the plants’ must-run strategy was not in the best interests of ratepayers.

Beyond that, a pending regulatory case will examine the coal plants’ costs from 2021 to 2023. And a July 31 filing by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel has asked the public utilities to open a case to review the coal plant charges for 2024 and 2025. The commission has not yet ruled on the request.

Meanwhile, spokespeople for American Electric Power and FirstEnergy told Canary Media their Ohio utilities will no longer include the coal charge on bills after August 14.

Others still paying

Due to a 2011 agreement among OVEC’s shareholders, both plants intend to keep operating until 2040.

So while customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities will no longer have to pay for the OVEC plants, other consumers will continue to bear the costs, said Neil Waggoner, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal program in the Midwest.

Those include the more than 380,000 homes and businesses that get their electricity from Ohio’s Electric Cooperatives, whose supplier is Buckeye Power.

Buckeye has an 18% share in OVEC, the next largest after AEP’s stake of roughly 39%. Elsewhere in the Midwest, Michigan’s public service commission recently disallowed more than $2 million in expenses charged by AEP’s Indiana Michigan Power for the same OVEC plants, while a July 23 ruling requires ratepayers in Indiana to pick up those costs.

Environmental costs from the plants also continue. Since 2020, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel estimates, the plants have spewed more than 63 million tons of carbon dioxide. The plants also emit nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate pollution that can cause health problems for those living downwind.

“That is a lot of dirty air,” Willis said, adding that ​“consumers got the bill, while the environment and public health paid the price.”

Both the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants cleared PJM’s capacity auction last month, which will pay generation facilities roughly $329 per megawatt/​day starting in June, said American Electric Power spokesperson Scott Blake, who also speaks for OVEC.

But even with the subsidies phasing out for many Ohio utility customers, Waggoner said that the bad business decision to keep these coal plants running has gotten even worse.

“These plants are really old industrial facilities,” Waggoner said. ​“They’re at the end of their lives. It’s time for these plants to be retired or replaced.”",https://highlandcountypress.com/sites/default/files/36998-acd99b42-6825-4670-9083-1cf8208792ba_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 19:03:04.505042

The vessel, designated MKII, will be deployed off the coast of Río Negro, Argentina, by late 2028 and will operate alongside Hilli Episeyo, which is scheduled to begin operations fourth-quarter 2027.

With both vessels online, the Argentina LNG 1 project will double its production capacity to 6 million tonnes/year (tpy), equivalent to about 27 million cu m/dayof natural gas, for export.

Staggered investment structure

Total investment across floating infrastructure, logistics, operations, and support is estimated at more than $15 billion over the 20-year lifespan of the project. The first phase (2024–31) will require roughly $3.2 billion, while the second phase (2032–35) will account for an additional $2.8 billion.

Both FLNG will be operated by Southern Energy, enabling process integration, operational synergies, and optimization of LNG loading, storage, and export logistics. The consortium projects cumulative exports exceeding $20 billion between 2027 and 2035.

FLNG plants

Hilli Episeyo was converted by Golar LNG in 2017 from a hull originally built in 1975. It currently operates offshore Cameroon. It has a nominal capacity of 2.4 million tpy. It will be moored in Golfo San Matías. MKII, originally built in 2004 as an LNG carrier, is undergoing conversion at CIMC Raffles shipyard in China. It will have liquefaction capacity of 3.5 million tpy.

Both floating units will be supplied with gas from Neuquén basin—primarily from the Vaca Muerta formation—via infrastructure that will allow year-round operations. Initially, Hilli Episeyo will receive gas through the San Martín pipeline, transporting gas from Austral basin through a swap mechanism until dedicated infrastructure is completed to handle shale gas processing from the Neuquén formation.

Strategic global play

The project marks a milestone for Argentina, which is positioning itself as a structural supplier in the global LNG market amid rising international competition, supply diversification, and energy transition.The floating model offers strategic advantages over onshore liquefaction plants, including lower initial capital expenditure, faster implementation timelines, and greater operational flexibility. It also circumvents regulatory and environmental bottlenecks typically associated with land-based plants.

Regional LNG markets are consolidating, with countries like Brazil and Chile expanding import capacity and diversifying supply sources. Argentina’s ability to supply LNG to Asia and Europe strengthens its goal of monetizing surplus production from Vaca Muerta and reducing energy trade imbalances.

The project operates within a regulatory framework that, while still requiring adjustments to incentivize long-term exports, has begun to show signs of stability in contracts, transportation, and foreign currency regulations. The involvement of YPF and major international players improves the project’s overall risk profile.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/08/68966939d41fc7b40c097673-hilli_episeyo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-08 18:03:28.797467

Cobalt, a crucial component in lithium-ion batteries, sits at the center of the electric vehicle revolution. As automakers race to secure reliable supply chains, understanding how cobalt feedstock tests for EV batteries has become increasingly important for manufacturers, investors, and consumers alike. This article explores the intricate world of cobalt feedstock testing and its far-reaching implications for the EV industry.

The Critical Role of Cobalt in Battery Manufacturing

Cobalt serves as an essential material in lithium-ion battery cathodes, playing a vital role in stabilizing the battery structure during charge and discharge cycles. Without cobalt, batteries would face significantly reduced lifespans and potentially dangerous thermal instability issues.

Key functions of cobalt in EV batteries include:

Enhancing energy density, allowing EVs to travel further on a single charge

Improving thermal stability and safety during rapid charging and discharging

Extending battery life through improved cycling performance

Enabling faster charging capabilities in premium battery designs

North America currently faces significant dependency on foreign cobalt processing, with China dominating the refining landscape. This dependency creates vulnerability in supply chains, particularly as EV production scales rapidly across the continent.

Complex Challenges in Cobalt Processing

The technical complexities in processing cobalt-bearing minerals represent a major hurdle for North American manufacturers. According to George Puvvada, VP of Metallurgy and Technology at a major battery materials company, ""North American concentrates often contain elevated levels of arsenic and other impurities, which have made them difficult to process using conventional methods.""

These challenges include:

Managing arsenic contamination, which can affect battery performance and pose environmental risks

Addressing complex sulfide mineralogy that resists traditional processing techniques

Overcoming compatibility issues with conventional smelting and refining methods

Meeting stringent battery-grade purity requirements of 99.8% or higher

Enhanced Processing Flexibility: Ability to handle complex mineralogy specific to North American deposits

Improved Impurity Management: Better arsenic and sulfide management capabilities

Environmental Advantages: Potentially lower emissions and waste production

Integration Potential: Compatibility with battery metals investment initiatives

According to industry experts, ""Many North American cobalt-bearing mineral resources have remained undeveloped due to mineralogy that is incompatible with conventional smelting and refining. Our hydrometallurgical process offers a potential domestic solution to that challenge, aligned with the battery market and geopolitical imperatives.""

Strategic Partnerships Driving Development

The formation of strategic partnerships has been crucial in developing viable cobalt supply chains. These collaborations bring together mining operations, processing technology, and end-users to create integrated supply networks.

Key partnership examples include:

Long-term offtake agreements between refiners and battery manufacturers

5-year supply agreements covering up to 80% of production output

Technical collaborations between processing companies and mining operations

Public-private partnerships supported by government initiatives

Industry analysts note that these partnerships not only secure material flow but also provide the financial stability needed for long-term infrastructure investment. Companies are also exploring opportunities presented by the Cobalt Blue expansion to further enhance supply chain resilience.

What Testing Methods Are Used for Cobalt Feedstock Evaluation?

Rigorous testing protocols are essential to determine whether cobalt materials meet the exacting standards required for EV battery production.

Metallurgical Testing Protocols

The metallurgical evaluation of cobalt-bearing materials follows a structured approach designed to assess both processability and final product quality:

Testing Phase Key Procedures Critical Parameters Sample Preparation Crushing, grinding, homogenization Particle size distribution, moisture content Characterization XRD, SEM-EDS, chemical assays Mineral composition, crystal structure, impurity profile Leaching Studies Acid leaching, selective dissolution Recovery efficiency, reaction kinetics, reagent consumption Impurity Removal Precipitation, solvent extraction, ion exchange Separation factors, impurity rejection rates Product Recovery Crystallization, electrowinning Product purity, morphology, particle size Scale-up Assessment Bench to pilot testing Process robustness, equipment sizing, operational parameters

""The cobalt feedstock tests will provide a clearer picture of how North American cobalt-bearing concentrates can be processed using hydrometallurgical technology,"" explains a metallurgy expert involved in the testing program.

Quality Assessment Parameters

For cobalt to be suitable for EV battery applications, it must meet stringent quality specifications that include:

Purity Requirements: Typically 99.8% minimum cobalt content

Trace Element Limits: Strict thresholds for nickel (<500 ppm), iron (<200 ppm), copper (<300 ppm), and other metals

Harmful Elements: Near-zero tolerance for arsenic, cadmium, and lead

Physical Properties: Specific surface area, particle size distribution, and morphology

Electrochemical Performance: Capacity retention, cycling stability, and rate capability

Testing typically includes multi-stage quality verification with both in-process and final product assessments to ensure consistent quality across production batches.

But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

The move is part of President Trump's effort to reverse former President Biden's climate agenda and boost fossil fuels instead.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills. Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.

Now, the fate of the program is in question, the Trump administration argues, because of a massive spending and tax bill Republicans passed last month.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country. Also, rooftop and community solar can help households avoid power shutoffs, which are dangerous in extreme heat and cold.

The Solar for All program, and the solar projects across the country, would have meant significant greenhouse gas reductions, says Costa Samaras, director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. ""We need all the clean power we can get right now,"" he says.

Researchers have now developed a new classical physics model that captures one of the most complex aspects of energy storage research—the dynamic nonequilibrium processes that throw chemical, mechanical and physical aspects of energy storage materials out of balance when they are charging or discharging energy.

The new Chen-Huang Nonequilibrium Phasex Transformation (NExT) Model was developed by Hongjiang Chen, a former Ph.D. student at NC State, in conjunction with his advisor, Hsiao-Ying Shadow Huang, who is an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the university. A paper on the work, ""Energy Change Pathways in Electrodes during Nonequilibrium Processes,"" is published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C.

But what are ""nonequilibrium processes""? Why are they important? And why would you want to translate those processes into mathematical formulae? We talked with Huang to learn more.

This is a highly technical paper, so I want to break it down piece by piece. To start with, what are ""nonequilibrium processes""? Why are they important?

When a lithium-ion battery is disconnected and sits for hours, it approaches equilibrium. In an equilibrium state, lithium-ion batteries exhibit no current flow, have uniformly distributed lithium-ion concentrations in the electrolyte and electrode materials, maintain stable temperatures without gradients (meaning the temperature is the same throughout the material), and present stable electrode potentials with no net chemical reactions occurring.

Even during slow charging and discharging, a lithium-ion battery is operating under nonequilibrium conditions.

Charging and discharging of lithium-ion batteries is fundamentally a nonequilibrium process, involving multiple transport phenomena that deviate significantly from thermodynamic equilibrium. That is, it pushes it far from its natural resting state, causing several physical and chemical changes inside the battery that can impact its performance and lifespan. Even during slow charging and discharging, the battery is operating under nonequilibrium conditions. But during rapid charging and discharging, the deviation from equilibrium is more pronounced.

Rapidly charging or drawing energy from a lithium-ion battery requires lithium ions to move rapidly through the electrolyte of the battery and into the electrodes. This creates an uneven distribution of ions with some areas becoming crowded with ions while others are depleted. This mass transport imbalance drives intense movement that deviates significantly from the lithium-ion battery's usual stable state, as the system cannot maintain uniform concentrations throughout.

But there are also other factors that come into play under nonequilibrium conditions.

Fast operation generates substantial heat, which spreads unevenly throughout the battery, creating hot and cool spots. These temperature differences cause chemical reactions to proceed at different rates in different locations, making the entire system increasingly unstable and further removed from its equilibrium state.

Under rapid charge and discharge conditions, the battery operates at voltages far removed from its ideal open-circuit voltage, meaning it cannot function in a balanced or energy-efficient manner. This electrochemical imbalance requires large overpotentials to drive the high current flows, again pushing the system further from equilibrium.

And the rapid movement of lithium-ions in and out of battery materials causes physical expansion and contraction that occurs faster than the materials can mechanically adjust, creating significant internal stress. This mechanical strain can lead to the formation of tiny cracks in the electrode materials and cause accelerated wear in certain parts of the battery. In materials like LiFePO4, these conditions force internal structural changes to occur under kinetically rushed conditions rather than through the naturally stable thermodynamic processes that would occur during slow operation.

In short, nonequilibrium processes can pose significant challenges when it comes to both having the battery operate efficiently and protecting the structural integrity of the battery.

Why is it important to understand these nonequilibrium processes?

Understanding these nonequilibrium aspects is crucial for the following reasons:

You must understand nonequilibrium processes to develop protocols for fast charging and discharging of energy from lithium-ion batteries that balance speed with safety and help to extend the longevity of lithium-ion batteries. (The challenge in rapid charging and discharging is managing nonequilibrium processes to achieve fast energy storage while minimizing degradation mechanisms that also arise from operating far from equilibrium.)

Nonequilibrium processes are critical for developing thermal management systems to handle the heat generated by these processes.

Understanding these processes is critical when designing materials that can be used in electrodes to better handle nonequilibrium transport.

There are no established classical physical models—mathematical formulas—that adequately capture those nonequilibrium processes? Is that correct?

There are classical physical models for lithium-ion batteries. However, their predictive accuracy is often limited. This limitation arises primarily from: (i) the use of model inputs with constrained accuracy, often based on linear assumptions; (ii) the omission of complex system phenomena, such as mass transport; and (iii) an incomplete understanding of the underlying processes and characteristics of lithium-ion battery systems—for example, widely used commercial simulation software is typically restricted to modeling equilibrium processes.

Why are these models important?

Accurate classical physical models provide the essential mathematical foundations and conceptual frameworks that support computational modeling of materials and enable machine learning (ML) programs to address questions related to materials science and engineering. The differential equations, optimization theory and statistical methods developed in physics directly translate into core ML algorithms—from gradient descent techniques to neural network operations.

Most importantly, physics demonstrates how complex phenomena can be understood through mathematical abstraction and iterative refinement, the same approach used in training ML models. Without the mathematical rigor, analytical thinking, and modeling paradigms from classical physics, machine learning would lack the computational tools and intellectual framework necessary to extract meaningful patterns from data and make reliable predictions.

So, what did you do here?

In this study, we propose a new mechanism to explain how lithium-ion battery materials like LiFePO4 (LFP) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) undergo phase transitions under nonequilibrium conditions—such as fast charging or discharging. We introduce the concept of path factors, which influence how energy changes within the material during lithium-ion insertion and removal. These factors interact with key properties like lithium content, mechanical strain, structural defects (dislocations) and material order.

Our simulations show that dislocation density, which increases with faster electrochemical reactions, plays a critical role in driving structural changes. By modeling these effects across multiple material states—like lithium-rich vs. lithium-poor and ordered vs. disordered—we capture how the internal structure shifts dynamically.

We validated our model by comparing simulation results to experimental data for both LFP and NMC materials across various charge/discharge rates. The agreement supports our pathway-altering mechanism as a powerful tool to understand and potentially improve battery performance under nonequilibrium conditions.

In other words, our model can be incorporated into computational tools to improve our ability to engineer better batteries.

Can the NExT Model you developed be used to address a variety of nonequilibrium processes? And, if so, why did you focus specifically on electrodes and lithium-ion batteries in the journal article?

Extensive experimental data are essential for developing accurate classical physical models, as they provide the empirical basis needed to transform theoretical ideas into reliable scientific understanding. For lithium-ion battery materials such as LFP and NMC, a wealth of experimental results from various research groups has become available. This abundance of data was a key motivation for developing the NExT Model, which is specifically designed to capture the behavior of these widely studied systems.

By drawing on experimental findings across different conditions, length scales and phenomena, we ensure that our mathematical formulations reflect real physical processes rather than remaining abstract theoretical constructs. The iterative interplay between modeling and experimentation enables us to identify model limitations, adjust key parameters, and uncover new physical insights—ultimately leading to more precise and comprehensive representations of complex systems.

What are other applications that can make use of the NExT Model?

Although our current published work focuses on lithium-ion battery materials such as LFP and NMC, the underlying pathway-altering mechanism and the concept of path factors are broadly applicable and can be extended to other energy storage systems, including multivalent battery materials (e.g., those based on magnesium, calcium or zinc). These systems often exhibit more complex ion–host interactions and phase behaviors, where nonequilibrium effects play an even more critical role.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/new-physical-model-aim.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 20:03:12.600040

“We have to see what the extreme risk scenarios can be and we should rebuild in a way in which the infrastructure can handle those extremes,” Dulal said.
Large building projects in South Asia typically receive environmental impact assessments that don’t adequately factor in the risks of floods and other disasters, Dulal said.
In 2024 alone, Asia experienced 167 disasters — including storms, floods, heat waves and earthquakes.
“These disasters are all wake-up calls,” said Ramesh Subramaniam, global director of programs and strategy at the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.","KATHMANDU, Nepal — Floods that damaged hydropower dams in Nepal and destroyed the main bridge connecting the country to China show the vulnerability of infrastructure and the need for smart reconstruction in a region bearing the brunt of climate change, experts say.

On July 8, Bhotekoshi River floodwaters killed nine people and damaged an inland container depot that was being built to support increasing trade between the two countries. The 10 damaged hydropower facilities, including three under construction, combined have capacity to power 600,000 homes.

Another smaller flood in the area on July 30 damaged roads and structures but caused less overall destruction. Elsewhere in the Himalayas, flash floods swept away roads, homes and hotels in northern India on Tuesday, killing at least four people and leaving many others trapped under debris, officials said.

The Himalayan region, which crosses Nepal and several nearby countries including India, is especially vulnerable to heavy rains, floods and landslides because the area is warming faster than the rest of the world due to human-caused climate change. Climate experts say the increasing frequency of extreme weather has changed the playbook for assessing infrastructure risks while also increasing the need for smart rebuilding plans.

“The statistics of the past no longer apply for the future,” said John Pomeroy, a hydrologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “The risk that goes into building a bridge or other infrastructure is generally based on historical observations of past risk, but this is no longer useful because future risk is different and often much higher.”

While damage estimates from the July floods in the Rasuwa region are still being calculated, past construction costs give a sense of the financial toll. The Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge, for example, cost $68 million to rebuild after it was destroyed by a 2015 earthquake that ravaged Nepal.

The latest disaster has also stoked fears of long-lasting economic damage in a region north of the capital city, Kathmandu, where reconstruction took place for years after the 2015 quake. Nepali government officials estimate that $724 million worth of annual trade with China took place over the bridge, and that has come to a standstill.

“Thank God there wasn’t much damage to local villages, but the container depot and bridges have been completely destroyed,” said Kaami Tsering, a local government official, in a phone interview with The Associated Press. “This has severely affected workers, hotel operators, laborers, and truck drivers who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods.”

Among those affected is Urken Tamang, a 50-year-old parking attendant at the depot who has been out of work for several weeks. A small tea shop he runs nearby with his family has also suffered.

“We’ve been unlucky,” said Tamang, a former farmer who sold his land and changed jobs when work on the depot began. “The whole area was severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake, and just when life was slowly returning to normal, this devastating flood struck.”

The Nepal floods are the latest in a series of disasters in South Asia during this year’s monsoon season. Research has shown that extreme weather in the region has contributed to more heat waves, heavy rains and melting glaciers.

Climate experts said smart planning and rebuilding in climate-vulnerable regions must include accounting for multiple risks. This includes installing early warning systems, preparing local communities for disasters and, when needed, relocating infrastructure.

“What we have to avoid is the insanity of rebuilding after a natural disaster in the same place where it occurred and where we know it will occur again at even higher probability,” said Pomeroy, the Canadian hydrologist. “That’s a very poor decision. Unfortunately, that’s what most countries do.”

Before rebuilding in Rasuwa, Nepal government officials need to assess overall risks, including those due to extreme weather and climate change, said Bipin Dulal, an analyst at Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.

The bridge connecting the two countries was rebuilt to better withstand earthquakes after the one in 2015, but it appears that officials didn’t properly account for the risk of flooding as intense as what occurred in early July, Dulal said.

“We have to see what the extreme risk scenarios can be and we should rebuild in a way in which the infrastructure can handle those extremes,” Dulal said.

Large building projects in South Asia typically receive environmental impact assessments that don’t adequately factor in the risks of floods and other disasters, Dulal said. The center is developing a multi-hazard risk assessment framework that it hopes will be adopted by planners and builders in the region to better account for the dangers of extreme weather.

In 2024 alone, Asia experienced 167 disasters — including storms, floods, heat waves and earthquakes. That was the most of any continent, according to the Emergency Events Database maintained by the University of Louvain, Belgium. These led to losses exceeding $32 billion, the researchers found.

“These disasters are all wake-up calls,” said Ramesh Subramaniam, global director of programs and strategy at the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. “These risks are real.”

A CDRI analysis found that $124 billion worth of Nepal’s infrastructure is vulnerable to the impacts of climate-driven disasters, creating the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses if the country doesn’t invest in resiliency.

“Investing a relatively smaller figure now would prevent the loss of these enormous sums of damages,” Subramaniam said.

Most climate investments are directed to mitigation, such as building clean energy projects and trying to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released, Subramaniam said. But given extreme weather damage already occurring, adaptation to climate change is equally important, he said.

“I think countries are learning and adaptation is becoming a standard feature in their annual planning,” he said.

Global efforts to prepare for such losses and recovery include a climate loss and damage fund set up by the United Nations in 2023. Currently, the fund has $348 million, which the U.N. warns is only a fraction of the annual economic damage related to human-caused climate change. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also provided loans or grants to build climate-resilient projects.

In Nepal’s recently flood-ravaged region, Tsering, the local government official, said the repeated disasters have exacted more than a financial toll on residents.

“Even though the river has now returned to a normal flow, the fear remains,” he said. “People will always worry that something like this could happen again.”

Benefits and impact of Solar for All in NC

The $156 million in federal funding was allocated to help about 12,000 households across the state. Participating families would be expected to see at least a 20% reduction in home energy bills.

""Solar for All would have helped people have access to clean energy and therefore reduce their energy bills,"" said Luis Martinez, Southeast Director for Climate and Energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""Particularly at a time when ... there is dire need for additional resiliency, weatherization, and distributed energy.""

Distributed energy means events like blackouts can be less likely, as there are fewer houses straining the system. When individual households decrease their reliance on the grid, it increases overall grid resiliency.

Martinez also emphasizes the economic benefits of Solar for All, including creating jobs and stimulating local businesses.

""The truth is clean energy is the cheapest, fastest to deploy, fastest growing resource right now,"" said Martinez. ""(The Trump administration) is not going to stop clean energy any more than they can stop the sun from shining.""

Legal challenges to follow soon

Martinez says legal challenges are already ramping up. Environmental advocates and democratic lawmakers disagree with the Trump's administration's claim that the One Big Beautiful Bill repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

""We believe that these funds have been appropriated by Congress and legally obligated so that they cannot be clawed back,"" said Martinez.

The Solar for All funding had already been obligated to organizations, tribal communities and state entities like the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The state program called Energize NC was funded through Solar for All. As NPR reports, because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

In a joint statement, North Carolina Democrats in the U.S House Representatives condemned the move. This includes Representatives Deborah Ross (NC-02), Alma Adams (NC-12), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), and Don Davis (NC-01).

“North Carolina has long been a leader in the clean energy economy, and this Administration’s actions over the past seven months are putting billions of dollars in economic investment in our state at risk,"" said the statement.

For example, GCAM predicts a larger increase in global soybean production, while GLOBIOM shows a more pronounced substitution of palm oil for soybean oil.","Biofuels are often marketed as homegrown low-carbon fuels, but that’s not an accurate description of where the industry is headed. Between 2022 and 2024 bio-based diesel (BBD) consumption soared, but more than 70 percent of the growth came from imported fuels or fuels made with imported vegetable oils and animal fats (called feedstocks). That was mathematically inevitable, because the quantity of BBD the US consumed in 2024 was made from a larger quantity of vegetable oil and animal fat than the US produced that year. And of course, there are other uses for vegetable oils and fats beyond biofuels, including food and products like soaps and detergents.

Congress and the Trump administration are trying to address rising imports with preferences for North American fuels and feedstocks in tax policy and penalties for imports in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed standards for 2026 and 2027 under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). But the fatal flaw in the RFS proposal is that it ignores any realistic assessment of how much domestic feedstock is available for fuel production, proposing volumes that far exceed domestic feedstock availability. These mandates can only be met with a combination of imports and counterproductive shuffling of vegetable oil out of food markets and into fuel markets, where it will be backfilled with increased imports in these markets. This will raise fuel prices for drivers, increase the deficit, raise food prices, increase global hunger and accelerate deforestation.

If the US government wants to support a homegrown biofuel industry it needs to be realistic about the available homegrown resources and scale its policies accordingly. The US no longer has any surplus vegetable oil or animal fat, and further enlarging mandates for bio-based diesel fuels will increase US reliance on imports in the form of biofuels, inputs to biofuel production or imports of oils and fats to replace those diverted from food to fuel use.

Longer term, novel feedstocks like winter cover crops, perennial crops, or agricultural residues can support increased biofuel production while improving water quality and soil health in the US Midwest. Supporting the development of these underutilized resources would be a smart long-term strategy, with positive returns to US farmers and energy security. But that will take time, and in the meantime, EPA should be scaling back biofuel mandates based on a realistic assessment of domestic feedstock availability. With recently enacted changes to tax policy, domestic feedstocks already enjoy a substantial preference over imports, so scaling back mandates to match domestic feedstock availability would primarily reduce imports of feedstock and fuel while continuing to support production of fuels made from domestic feedstocks. This would save drivers and taxpayers money and reduce harm to the environment and food markets.

Bio-based diesel has outgrown domestic feedstocks

The rapid growth of bio-based diesel consumption has outpaced domestic feedstock production as shown in Figure 1 below. By 2024 the feedstock required to produce all the bio-based diesel produced or imported to the US exceeded total US production of oils and fats for all uses. With fuel production now consuming more fats and oils than total US production, the US is increasingly dependent on imports for vegetable oil for fuel, food and other uses. Increasing the domestic share of bio-based diesel feedstock by increasing imports in food markets does not in any meaningful way improve US energy security, and it is costly for consumers and harmful to the environment and food markets in the US and around the world.

Where does the feedstock come from?

While Figure 1 compares total US production of vegetable oils and fats to feedstock requirements of US BBD consumption, Figure 2 looks specifically at the feedstock used to produce BBD and what share of these feedstocks were imported. It shows that the surge in BBD consumption between 2022 and 2024 relied heavily on imported feedstocks and fuels, which is not surprising given that BBD consumption is growing so much faster than domestic feedstock production.

The US has become a major vegetable oil importer

While the US is importing 5.5 Million Metric Tons (MMT) of BBD feedstock and another 3.3 MMT of feedstock in the form of finished fuel, this understates the overall impact, because the US is also importing steadily more of the vegetable oil it uses for food. Figure 3 shows total US trade balance in all oils and fats, for food, fuel and other uses. Before the biofuel era, the US had almost balanced trade in vegetable oil, with net imports of less than 1 MMT in 2011. Imports have grown steadily and took off in the last few years with net imports now exceeding 9 MMT. The US generally has a large agricultural surplus, exporting more agricultural commodities than it imports, but for vegetable oil the US is now the 4th largest importer of vegetable oil in the world, behind only India, China and the European Union.

Wonk Alert: jump to the conclusion for the TL;DR

The discussion below gets almost four thousand words deep into the details of the EPA’s Proposed Renewable Fuel Standards for 2026 and 2027 and was submitted as my public comment. Click here to jump to the conclusion.

The RFS proposal exceeds domestic feedstock availability by 3 billion gallons

To evaluate the EPA proposal, I’ll switch back to billions of gallons of fuel. Converting the feedstock figures above to gallons, in 2024 the US consumed 5.6 billion gallons of bio-based diesel, but only 3.2 billion gallons, or about 57 percent, were made from domestic feedstocks. Looking forward, EPA’s analysis finds that domestic feedstock availability could support annual increases of 275 million gallons of bio-based diesel. On page 297 of the Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment (DRIA) EPA summarizes various projections of available soybean oil to BBD producers. USDA’s estimate is 50 million gallons a year, while the American Soybean Association suggests 350 million gallons a year. To put these numbers in context, trend yield growth of soybeans over the last 50 years is 0.51 bushels per acre per year, so yield growth from the approximately 85 million acres of soybeans harvested each year in the US would supply less than 60 million gallons of BBD[iii], even if all the yield growth was devoted to fuel production. Growth rates for soybean oil that exceed this figure cannot be met with yield growth, and imply diversion of soybeans from existing markets and expansion of acreage of soybeans at the expense of other crops or land uses. EPA does a similar analysis for fats oils and greases and canola oil and produces the following summary on page 304.

EPA’s decision to project a 250 million gallon annual increase in soybean oil is far above yield growth and much closer to that of industry studies than USDA’s projection of 50 millions gallons a year. But even with this optimistic estimate, EPA still projects only 275 million gallons per year of available domestic BBD feedstock, and the majority of available feedstock in this assessment (350 million gallons of BBD) is imported. Adding EPA’s assessment of domestic availability to production from domestic feedstocks in 2024 would support not more than 3.75 billion gallons of domestic BBD in 2026. Yet the proposed standard is about 3 billion gallons more than that. This is a recipe for substantial increases in imported feedstock and the diversion of domestic feedstock from food to fuel markets.

Discounting credits for imported feedstocks and fuels is unnecessary and counterproductive

EPA arbitrarily proposes to discount the compliance value for imported feedstocks and fuels by 50 percent, motivated by the desire to focus the RFS on domestic feedstock. The compliance credits under the RFS are referred to as RINs for Renewable ID Numbers, and they are the currency of the RFS. The EPA proposes that imported fuels or fuels made from imported feedstocks would generate just 50 percent as many RINs as fuels made from domestic feedstocks. This RIN discounting proposal came as a surprise, and it appears to have been developed late in the process of EPA’s analysis, as it is inconsistent with the framework adopted in bulk of EPAs analysis in the DRIA.

The goal of prioritizing domestic production is not itself unreasonable and is consistent with the statutory goals of the RFS. However, the proposed RIN discounting mechanism is a poorly designed tool for that job. Recently enacted changes to the 45Z biofuel tax credit ensure that North American feedstocks and fuels already enjoy a substantial preference, rendering the RIN discounting redundant. Moreover, as a mechanism to reduce imports the RIN discounting mechanism will backfire, since while RINs issued for imported fuels will be reduced, the overall size of the mandate will not be adjusted, so twice the volume of imports will be required to meet the portion of the RFS that cannot be met with domestic feedstocks and fuels. This approach also undermines market clarity by adding uncertainty into how much biofuel will ultimately be required to comply with the RFS.

One major impact of the RIN discounting will be to divert a lot of US vegetable oils from existing uses to use making fuel. The diversion of domestic feedstock from food to fuel uses is discussed in the DRIA in section 3.2. On page 95, EPA explains that the 50 percent reduction in RINs for imported feedstock “will incentivize BBD producers to pay higher prices for these domestic vegetable oils than their current markets. […] other markets will turn to imported canola oil and/or corn oil to satisfy their market demand, or alternatively will switch to other vegetable oils in greater supply or reduce their use of vegetable oils.” To put some numbers to this, if the price of a bio-based diesel RIN is $1.50, a pound of domestic soybean oil will be worth 15 cents per gallon more to a renewable diesel producer than imported soybean oil, but a producer of food or other products will not receive this premium for domestic feedstocks. Average annual prices for soybean oil have ranged from 28 to 73 cents per pound over the last decade, averaging 45 cents per pound, so a 15 cent per pound difference is 20-50 percent of the value of the oil. In a commodity market this seems likely to overwhelm other factors and lead to extensive diversion of soybean oil from food to fuel uses, with these non-fuel markets backfilled with imported oils. Notably, EPA names only canola and corn oil as potential import replacements, ignoring palm oil and soybean oil, which account for two thirds of global vegetable oil exports, and are closely linked to deforestation.

Who pays the price for larger mandates and who benefits?

The cost of policies supporting bio-based diesel is considerable. As Professor Irwin at farmdoc daily explains, bio-based diesel prices (not counting direct and indirect subsidies) tend to be about double those of fossil diesel, a difference of about $2 per gallon, which must be made up by policy. There are a number of different policies that determine how these costs are distributed to different parties. Generally, costs are borne by people buying gasoline and diesel and taxpayers that bear the cost of tax credits. US BBD consumption exceeded 5 billion gallons in 2024, meaning the total costs are above $10 billion a year, and as the volumes rise so do the costs[iv].

Most of that money is simply wasted, turning expensive vegetable oil into cheap diesel. Moreover, because vegetable oil production, biodiesel production and renewable diesel production are mature technologies, there is no realistic prospect that scaling up production will bring down costs. By design, the RFS was intended to support the development of innovative not-yet commercialized technologies that would produce low carbon cellulosic biofuels from inexpensive and underutilized agricultural residues or high yielding perennial grasses that build soil carbon and reduce erosion and water pollution. While the commercialization of cellulosic biofuels has moved much more slowly than was envisioned in 2007, when the RFS was last amended, scaling up the productive use of underutilized and sustainable feedstocks remains a worthwhile policy goal. However, ramping up mandates for mature commodities far beyond domestic availability is inconsistent with the statutory criteria EPA is required to consider in setting biofuel volumes under the RFS.

The largest share of the cost of BBD support is transferred to US fuel consumers through the RFS. Analysis by the EPA in the DRIA find that more than 90 percent of the cost of complying with the RFS, $6.7 billion a year, is associated with BBD. These costs are spread across all the gasoline and diesel fuel consumed in the United States, adding about 10 cents per gallon to the cost of diesel fuel and 4.5 cents per gallon to gasoline, according to EPA’s DRIA[v]

A portion of the cost is also born by taxpayers who subsidize biofuel production through tax credits. Increasing the size of the RFS increases the cost of these tax credits, adding to the deficit and debt. The unprecedented nature of the RFS proposal, the uncertainty in how much feedstock will be imported and how US and global agriculture markets will respond and the simultaneous changes in tax policy make it difficult to project with confidence the overall and distributional impact on costs for US drivers and taxpayers. My intuition is that EPA’s estimates are too low, but more thorough analysis is needed. Ultimately we won’t know the full cost until the policy is implemented.

Despite this uncertainty, it is clear the costs of the proposal far exceed the benefits. The only monetized economic benefits spelled out in the proposal are $163 million in energy security benefits, or 3 percent of the fuel costs. EPA does not include any estimate of environmental costs or benefits, but as discussed below it is clear based on EPA analysis that the increase in crop-based fuels driven by the proposal would increase deforestation and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

Insofar as anyone wins from this proposal, the primary beneficiaries are palm oil producers. Even though palm oil is not used directly to make biofuel in the US, EPA analysis and common sense make it clear that palm oil (as the largest source of vegetable oil production and exports in the world) and other foreign feedstocks will backfill food markets in the US and around the world that had previously been consuming soybean oil. Meat producers around the globe may also benefit from cheap soybean meal subsidized by US drivers and taxpayers. And oil companies (the petroleum variety) benefit in three ways: by producing heavily subsidized bio-based diesel; by reducing compliance costs of fuel regulations in states with Low Carbon Fuel Standards[vi]; and by misleading the public about the feasible low carbon alternatives to gasoline and diesel.

The proposal will lead to costly feedstock diversion without significantly expanding demand for soybeans and a limited and uncertain impact on soybean prices

Increasing the RFS mandate beyond domestic feedstock availability will provide a limited benefit to US farmers, because they can’t sell more soybeans than they produce. EPA does not project expanded production of soybeans. Two potential responses to increased demand for domestic feedstock are the diversion of domestic feedstocks from existing markets, and the diversion of whole soybeans from overseas crushing facilities to domestic crushing facilities. EPA’s projection that domestic soybean oil availability would grow by 250 million pounds, discussed above and in section 7.2.4.1 of the DRIA, already assumes rapid expansion of domestic crushing capacity, consistent with input from the soybean industry. Crush capacity expansion beyond this level is unlikely in the timeframe of the proposal since it takes several years to build additional crushing capacity.

But neither diverting US soybean oil from food to fuel nor diverting exported soybeans to domestic crushing facilities will increase overall demand for soybeans. The global market for soybeans is ultimately constrained by demand for soybean meal, which makes up 80 percent of each bushel of soybeans. The RFS proposal combined with the changes to tax policy will lead to shuffling of vegetable oil in US and global markets, as domestic soybean oil is redirected to fuel use to cash in on subsidies and mandates and other vegetable oils replace US soybean oil in unregulated food markets in the US and around the world. But at the end of the day, the high costs to consumers and taxpayers translate into small changes if any in demand for US soybeans.

The other question is whether this proposal will increase the price of US soybeans. It will almost certainly increase the price of domestic soybean oil, but the impact on price of the soybeans that farmers actually sell is more complicated. EPA’s analysis on this topic is based on a 2022 paper by Lusk prepared for the US Soybean Board on the impact of soybean oil BBD on food prices. This analysis explains that expanded biofuel production will cause a large increase in soybean oil prices, but a much smaller impact on soybean prices. Specifically, it projects that a 20% increase in soybean oil used for biofuel production will increase soybean oil prices by 8% but will only increase farm-level soybean prices by 0.9%. This is consistent with the recent USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates released on July 11th, which accounts for the revised tax policy and the RFS proposal and projects large increases in the use of domestic soybean oil and in US soybean oil prices. Projected soybean oil prices increased 15 percent from $0.46 to $0.53 per pound. But increased soybean crushing puts downward pressure on soybean meal prices, which are projected to fall 6 percent from $310 to $290 per short ton. Prices projected for whole soybeans are almost unchanged, down 1.5 percent from $20.25 to $20.10 per bushel.

The point is that large increases in soybean oil prices will translate into much smaller increases in prices for whole soybeans. The RFS and tax policy changes are likely to disrupt global markets in significant and unprecedented ways and thus the impacts are hard to predict based on historical data, especially in a context where rapid changes in tariffs and trade patterns are already creating a turmoil in global agricultural markets. But the benefits for US farmers will be much smaller than the costs imposed on drivers and taxpayers, making this a very costly and inefficient way to support farmers.

What is the climate impact of expanding BBD?

While the EPA under administrator Zeldin has been clear in its disregard for the importance of climate stabilization, the RFS statute clearly identifies reducing global warming emissions as a central goal of the policy. EPA’s analysis for the DRIA reveals that the likely impact of dramatically expanding BBD consumption would be to increase global warming emissions. The two models evaluated, GCAM and GLOBIOM, differ in many ways, but both found large expansions of cropland would be required globally, with associated increases in emissions from land use change emissions[vii]. While both models nominally found that there are climate benefits of the proposal compared to a no-RFS baseline, this does not address the more salient question of how expanding the use of BBD beyond domestic availability will affect the climate, and whether the proposal is consistent with RFS statutory guidelines. However, we can infer the answers to these questions from the analysis EPA presents.

EPA’s analysis in the DRIA compares High and Low Volume Scenarios and the Proposed Volumes to a No RFS scenario (Tables 5.1.1-1 and 5.1.1-2). The only difference between the High and Low Volume Scenarios is in the use of BBD. The Low Volume Scenario evaluates an RFS that grows by 312 million gallons of renewable diesel each year from 2026 to 2028 and the High-Volume Scenario grows twice this fast. According to EPA’s analysis, the only fuels that will be affected by this growth are renewable diesel made from soybean and canola oil. By comparing the climate impact of the High and Low Volume scenarios we can determine the climate impact of increasing vegetable oil BBD consumption.

Both GCAM and GLOBIOM find that expanding consumption of BBD will lead to an increase of about 200 MMT of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from land use change (including deforestation) and agriculture, but they differ in their net emissions once fossil fuel displacement is taken into consideration. The GCAM model finds a net emissions increase of 93 MMT CO2e, while EPA claims that GLOBIOM projects a net decrease of 87 MMT CO2e. However, the emissions reduction EPA attributes to GLOBIOM is not derived directly from that model, which does not include a detailed endogenous treatment of fuel markets and therefore can’t directly calculate emissions reductions from fossil fuel consumption. EPA makes an ad hoc assumption that the production of biofuels directly displaces petroleum fuels on a one-for-one basis, with no effect in other markets. This assumption ignores the well-known rebound effect, whereby reduced consumption of petroleum in the US lowers prices globally leading to increased petroleum consumption outside the US[viii]. This treatment is arbitrary and indefensible and means the GLOBIOM climate impact findings are clearly too optimistic.

Putting aside this problem with the GLOBIOM results, the climate benefits obtained from GLOBIOMs are still less than the RFS requirements for advanced biofuel. The GLOBIOM analysis finds that cumulative emissions associated with producing the additional BBD in the High Volume versus the Low Volume scenario are 66.3 g CO2e per MJ of additional BBD produced[ix]. This represents just a 27 percent emissions reduction versus 91 g CO2e/MJ for fossil diesel, which does not meet the statutory requirement that advanced biofuels reduce GHG emissions by 50 percent.

In summary, EPA’s analysis suggests that the climate impact of expanding RFS mandates beyond the level in the Low Volume Scenario is negative, or at best insufficient to justify the proposal. The GCAM model finds it will increase global warming pollution, while the GLOBIOM model, even biased by optimistic assumptions of fossil fuel displacement, finds a modest reduction of 27 percent compared to fossil diesel, which falls well short of the statutory requirement that advanced biofuels reduce emissions by 50 percent compared to fossil fuels they replace.

The RFS proposal will harm global food consumers and accelerate deforestation

In the long run, increases in consumption of vegetable oil that outstrip demand for protein meal will primarily benefit producers of vegetable oil that produce less protein meal, primarily palm oil. However, it will take time for palm oil production to replace the diverted soybean oil, because palm oil plantations take several years between a decision to expand and time to yield fruit. In the interim, global markets for vegetable oils will be tight, leading to higher prices. According to an analysis from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), “Vegetable oils are a key item in diets around the world and an essential source of fats, accounting for about 10% of daily caloric food supply (300 kcal per day per person), making them the second most important food group after cereals.[…] Vegetable oils are, of course, an essential cooking item, particularly for poor consumers unable to shift to more expensive butter or other animal fat-based products.” The IFPRI report finds that each metric ton of vegetable oil converted into biodiesel globally represent an equivalent amount of calories to feed more than 10 million people per year. Thus, EPA’s proposal to set mandates 3 billion gallons beyond its own assessment of domestic availability will divert 11 million metric tons of vegetable oil from food to fuel markets which would otherwise provide calories to feed 100 million people per year.

Over time, palm oil production will expand to replace the displaced soybean oil and bring down prices. Palm oil is ineligible for the RFS because of its role in deforestation, but when it backfills diverted soybean oil, the harm may be one step removed from US biofuel production, but it happens just the same. The expansion of soybean and palm oil is a major driver of tropical deforestation. Recent analysis finds that annual forest carbon loss in the tropics doubled during the early twenty-first century[x] and that oil palm and soybeans are, respectively, the second and third largest drivers of deforestation after cattle[xi].

In conclusion

Back in 2016 I concluded a long blog on biodiesel with this warning:

While EPA’s decisions from 2016 to 2024 expanded the BBD market much faster than I recommended, EPA acknowledged the risks of excessive growth and set mandates below the extreme requests made by the biofuel industry. In comparison, the current proposal is extreme, proposing mandates completely untethered to any realistic assessment of feedstock availability. The expansion of imported feedstocks in the last few years has created political pressure to focus the biofuel support on domestic resources, which is understandable. But the EPA’s RFS proposal has no rational basis as a domestic fuel policy. Instead of massive growth, the RFS should be scaled back in line with domestic feedstock availability to support a domestic biofuels industry at a scale that makes sense given competing uses for food, crops and land and delivers a clear reduction in global warming pollution.

[i] Data on total production of vegetable oils and edible fats is from the ERS Oil Crops Yearbook plus technical tallow data from NASS Quick Stats. Data on feedstock consumption comes from Gerveni, M., T. Hubbs and S. Irwin. “FAME Biodiesel, Renewable Diesel, and Biomass-Based Diesel Feedstock Trends over 2011-2023.” farmdoc daily (14):71, Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, April 12, 2024 and EIA Monthly Biofuels Capacity and Feedstocks Update.

[iii] Assuming 11 pounds of soybean oil per bushel and 8.125 pounds of soybean oil per gallon of BBD., even if all the yield growth was devoted to fuel production. Growth rates for soybean oil that exceed this figure cannot be met with yield growth, and imply diversion of soybeans from existing markets and expansion of acreage of soybeans at the expense of other crops or land uses. EPA does a similar analysis for fats oils and greases and canola oil and produces the following summary on page 304.

[iv] Note that $2 per gallon is the minimum price to make it possible to sell BBD and serves a floor for costs. To the extent that RD sales have higher margins than fossil diesel, or that tax credits result in higher returns than in comparable fossil supply chains, the actual costs to consumers and taxpayers are likely to be significantly higher.

[v] The EPA analysis of the price impacts on gasoline in is Table 10.5.2-7, diesel is in 10.5.3-7 and the total fuel cost impact is in Table 10.6-1, which also finds Energy Security Benefits of $163 million. EPA does not estimate the financial value of other benefits of the program.

[vi] Oil companies reduce their obligations under Low Carbon Fuel Standard policies by shifting RFS compliance into those states to maximize overlap in their obligations. For more details, see my January 2024 Blog, A Cap on Vegetable Oil-Based Fuels Will Stabilize and Strengthen California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

[vii] The GCAM and GLOBIOM models used by EPA differ in model structure and assumptions and predict qualitatively different impacts. For example, GCAM predicts a larger increase in global soybean production, while GLOBIOM shows a more pronounced substitution of palm oil for soybean oil. Moreover, GLOBIOM lacks a detailed/endogenous treatment of the energy sector, meaning it does not capture the substantial rebound effect and thus exaggerates the impact of US biofuel expansion by ignoring rebounds in both global biofuel and oil markets.

[viii] This treatment is inconsistent with the consequential lifecycle analysis used elsewhere in EPA’s land use change assessment and renders the results unreliable. The National Academy of Sciences’ panel on “Current Methods for Life-Cycle Analyses of Low-Carbon Transportation Fuels”, on which I served, recommends that consequential analyses are required to determine “consequential life-cycle impact of the proposed policy is likely to reduce net GHG emissions. EPA notes this recommendation and claims its analysis is consistent with it, but EPA’s ad hoc treatment of fossil fuel displacement in the GLOBIOM case is inconsistent with this recommendation.

The President even invoked the Defense Production Act to get the Pentagon involved.

That president was Joe Biden. President Trump is picking up where Biden left off, and making even more investments.

One which is getting support from the Bi-partisan Infrastructure Law is in the central North Dakota town of Beulah, population 3,000. Coal and farming have been the economic anchors here for decades. Now, a former coal mine is set to be transformed into the site of a new processing plant for nickel ore coming from Minnesota.

""Basically when you put all your eggs in one basket and something changes, it makes it difficult for your community to thrive and continue to grow"" said Beaver Brinkman, Beulah's Economic Development and Operations Director. ""Hopefully, this will take and diversify our economy.""'

In 2023, The US Department of Energy awarded a $114 million grant for the new nickel processing plant. Nickel is used in electric car batteries. Tesla signed a contract for 75,000 metric tons from the plant.

It's also used in computers and to strengthen steel. Retired four-star Marine General John Allen says that makes nickel a strategic asset.

""What the Pentagon's trying to do is to lock in and preserve these raw materials for the highly sophisticated technologically advanced warfare that the United States wields today,"" he said.

Talon Metals owns both the Minnesota mine and the proposed processing facility in Beulah. The Pentagon gave Talon a $20 million matching grant to look for more minerals in the US. New mines don't open very often here, and refineries to process what comes out of them are even more rare.

""The United States and Europe and other of the technologically advanced societies sort of backed themselves into an environment where we imported a lot of these materials, mostly from China,"" Allen said.

Allen is on the board of the US arm of a security-oriented think tank called GLOBESEC. They estimate China controls 75% of the world's critical metals and mining materials.

Talon vice president Jessica Johnson welcomes the federal backing.

""Across multiple administrations, I think it's clear that domestic raw materials for our supply chains, everything from clean energy technologies to our defense and national security platforms and technologies– it's a bipartisan issue,"" she said.

There's no organized opposition to the nickel plant in Beulah.

Over breakfast at the Country Kettle restaurant, retiree Garry Teske says it sounds like it could bring some good jobs. But he'd like to know more.

""I have nothing against it but it's pretty hush hush around here,"" Teske said. ""We don't hear much.""

Talon's Minnesota mine is facing some opposition from a neighboring tribe and environmental groups. If approved, the company expects both the mine and the nickel processing plant to be operational in 2029.

One of Lula’s vetoes also addresses protection of another endangered area, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, which is the focus of the work of Ribeiro’s group.","SAO PAULO (AP) — Brazil’s president vetoed Friday parts of a congressional bill that sought to overhaul the country’s environmental licensing rules — legislation pushed by the right-wing opposition but which environmentalists say would impede efforts to protect sensitive areas such as the Amazon rainforest.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva threw out 63 out of the controversial bill’s 400 measures, the government said, though the significance of the vetoes will be clearer once the bill is published in the official gazette and goes into effect.

Lula’s supporters and environmentalists had dubbed the legislation “Devastation Bill,” while allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro, held in house arrest on charges linked to an alleged coup plot, had pushed for its approval in congress.

Critics had argued that the bill undermines safeguards and harms Brazil’s credibility ahead of hosting U.N. climate talks in November.

Environment protection groups welcomed Lula’s vetoes — though congress can still take steps to override them and introduce additional legislation.

Several government ministers, speaking at a news conference at the presidential palace, lauded Lula’s changes, saying he threw out parts of the legislation that would allow for fast-tracking of projects in the Amazon and curtailed the authority of federal agencies in issuing licenses for projects.

Only enterprises of “low polluting potential” will be allowed to get that kind of fast track, the ministers said.

It was not immediately clear if Lula had vetoed a measure on upgrading existing roads without oversight, which could allow the paving of the entire highway running about 900 kilometers (560 miles) through the western Amazon.

Lula doesn’t have the majority in Brazil’s congress, where Bolsonaro allies often side with moderates to pass conservative legislation.

“We understand we are keeping a dialogue with congress and assuring that there is integrity in environmental licensing,” Environment Minister Marina Silva said.

“This is fundamental for the protection of the environment in a context of climate crisis, loss of biodiversity and desertification processes,” she added.

Lula had already spoken about possibly vetoing parts of the bill after it passed in congress last month. Brazil’s lower house approved the legislation by 267-116 in July, dealing a big blow to Lula after several moderates had sided with Brazil’s opposition.

The 79-year-old leftist Lula — who was facing higher unpopularity, growing opposition in congress and increasing risks to his likely reelection bid — saw his polls improve days later, after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.

Trump, an ally of Bolsonaro, had linked the tariffs to Bolsonaro’s trial, which he called a “witch hunt” and demanded an end to the proceedings.

Miriam Belchior, an official with Brazil’s chief of staff, said Lula’s vetoes will safeguard the “rights of Indigenous peoples and communities of descendants of slaves, and incorporate mechanisms to make licensing quicker, but without harming” Brazil’s natural resources.

“This is a victory for the society,” said Malu Ribeiro, head of the SOS Atlantica nonprofit organization.

One of Lula’s vetoes also addresses protection of another endangered area, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, which is the focus of the work of Ribeiro’s group. Without the vetoes, she said there would have been much harm to efforts of “everyone who defends this national treasure.”

Sridhar Babu said on Friday.

The Minister was speaking after inaugurating a ₹65 crore CRGO Core Processing Centre and a ₹105 crore Surge Arrester Line at the Toshiba Transmission & Distribution Systems (India) (TTDI) facility in Rudraram, near Hyderabad. He also laid the foundation for a ₹177 crore expansion of TTDI’s power transformers manufacturing line, Mr. Sridhar Babu’s office said, sharing breakup of the ₹347 crore investment by the company on the projects.

Citing the Economic Survey (2024–25) estimates that India’s domestic electricity demand will double by 2040, the Minister said, “We are proactively working to attract new industries to meet this demand. The State government has also introduced the Clean and Green Energy Policy – 2025. “So far, we have attracted investments worth ₹29,000 crore in the clean energy sector. Special plans are being formulated and implemented to scale up new renewable energy capacity to 20,000 MW by 2030,” he said

Toshiba and the Telangana government are also launching a research and development hub for smart energy solutions. There are immense opportunities in Telangana for investments in clean tech, semi-conductors, robotics, and advanced manufacturing, he said, urging Japanese firms to invest in the State.

Separately, the company said the new manufacturing lines are part of the ₹562 crore (Japanese Yen 10 billion) investment commitment TTDI made and signed an MoU with the State government during Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy’s visit to Japan earlier this year. The proposed investment is expected to generate over 250 direct jobs over the three years from FY 2024, further contributing to the socio-economic development of the region. The strategic initiative reinforces Toshiba’s long-term commitment to establish India as its manufacturing base and export hub for transmission and distribution (T&D) business, it said.

The CRGO Core Processing Centre has a capacity to process 12,000 tonnes of Cold Rolled Grain-Oriented steel annually, while the Surge Arrester Production Line is designed to manufacture 80,000 units per year. The EHV Power Transformer expansion project will increase TTDI’s overall power transformer production capacity from 30,000 MVA per annum to 42,000 MVA per annum. These additions will enhance TTDI’s domestic and global supply capabilities to support growing demand in India and international markets.

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin said.

Lower-income Hoosiers are more likely to live in older, less energy-efficient homes that use more power. Advocates said putting solar on these homes not only lowers their energy bills, but also reduces the need for more power plants — which all electric utility customers pay for.

The funding cut comes at a time when the average Indiana resident's bill has gone up by $28 a month since last year. Mo McReynolds directs Indianapolis's Office of Sustainability.

""Indianapolis, compared to other cities our size, has a particularly high energy burden — meaning the ratio of an average household income that gets paid toward their utility bills. We're particularly good candidate for a program like this,"" she said.

Alison Becker is with Solar Opportunities Indiana, a coalition helping to mange the grant funding. She said, without the federal dollars, most of the solar projects the group oversees won't move forward.

That includes plans to put solar and battery storage at libraries in lower-income, southern Indiana communities — which would help during storms when the power is out.

Earlier this year, Tech Brew reported that despite being pioneered at the start of the 20th century, geothermal energy is still considered emerging tech in the US.

Geothermal heating Now, there are some big changes afoot in the geothermal heating industry.
Previously, home builders were unable to benefit from the clean energy production tax credits because they wouldn’t own the geothermal heating system for long enough.","After well over a hundred years bearing the scrawny “emerging technology” tag, is geothermal energy about to pop off?

Earlier this year, Tech Brew reported that despite being pioneered at the start of the 20th century, geothermal energy is still considered emerging tech in the US. Geothermal expert and Cornell University Professor of Sustainable Energy Systems Jefferson Tester told us at the time that geothermal struggled to compete with other renewable energy sources like wind and solar because “you can’t look at a geothermal system underground like you can look at a wind turbine or a solar field.”

What a difference a couple of months makes: After the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” kickstarted a rapid sunset of clean energy tax credits for solar and wind power, but preserved production and investment subsidies for geothermal, all eyes are on the underground energy resource. And geothermal pros we talked with said they’re ready to take advantage of the tech’s big moment.

“We’re at an inflection point for geothermal,” Dawn Owens, Fervo Energy’s head of project development and commercial markets, told Tech Brew. “It’s finally ready to take off.”

Owens said that the ethos at Fervo, a Houston-headquartered geothermal company with a development in Utah that’s been getting congressional attention, has always been that “geothermal was going to massively take off in the United States.” Now, she thinks it’s happening because the energy source is at “perfect confluence of both market and technology readiness coming together.”

Baseload power

The US energy market is in desperate need of baseload power: Data centers, increasing electrification, and general rising energy demand have led the Trump administration and Congress to turn toward always-on energy sources like geothermal and nuclear power (which also kept its tax credits).

“Geothermal has always been a bipartisan resource. It was just bipartisanly forgotten about before,” Owens said. “It really is a win-win-win solution here for the moment that we’re in.”

Matthew Houde, chief of staff at geothermal company Quaise Energy, told Tech Brew that “there’s a strong reason to spur investment in geothermal” because it can do what mature, albeit intermittent, sources of energy like wind and solar can’t. (Solar and wind, however, can be made less intermittent by using battery storage, and doing so has been shown to meaningfully support the grid.) Under Trump’s budget bill, tax credits for wind and solar power implemented as part of the Inflation Reduction Act are quickly being phased out.

“[The tax credits are] a tailwind for geothermal to begin to derisk and expand the scale [on] which geothermal operates today,” Houde said. “Comparing wind and solar to geothermal installations over the past 10 years, geothermal is like a fraction of a fraction of the amount of capacity we’ve installed with wind and solar.”

Quaise Energy is a geothermal developer that’s working to harvest energy from superhot geothermal resources—think 300 to 400 degrees Celsius—and “developing millimeter wave drilling technology,” which uses “high powered microwaves to blast through rock” and create multiple geothermal wells. Because of the increased demand for geothermal power, Quaise is focused on developing its first geothermal project in the Western US while continuing to work on its new drilling technology.

“In this industry, say, about eight years ago…there wasn’t as much optimism that there was going to be large growth for geothermal,” Houde said.

Geothermal heating

Now, there are some big changes afoot in the geothermal heating industry. Though homeowners are losing the 25D residential clean energy tax credit, which could be applied to geothermal heat pumps as well as battery or solar systems, among others, geothermal heating systems can now be leased due to provisions in Trump’s budget bill. Previously, home builders were unable to benefit from the clean energy production tax credits because they wouldn’t own the geothermal heating system for long enough. The systems can now be leased through a third party, which can pass on the tax credit savings to both the home builder and owner.

“We predict it could have a huge positive impact on the home builder market,” Kathy Hannun, founder and president of residential geothermal heating company Dandelion Energy, told Tech Brew. “We can still give homeowners a mechanism for monetizing that tax credit. You’ll just have to accept a lease, which not every homeowner will want to do.”

Hannun said the next step for Dandelion is to figure out how geothermal heating leases should work—but they’re not looking to reinvent the wheel; rather, they’ll seek advice from the solar industry, which has long offered leasing models. And her hope is that geothermal power can be deployed at the level that solar is now, with the help of its surviving tax credit.

“Geo won’t benefit from the misfortune of the other clean tech players, but I think the fact that we’ve been largely spared with [the 48E tax credit] will be essential to preserving our future and allowing us to continue to scale,” Hannun said. “Geo has had a lot less time than wind and solar to do that.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/e532c61c5c1309d48573aae5b33c9d795e50eff3-1500x1000.png?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-08-08 18:04:33.371880

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the termination of two federal grants awarded in June 2024 to the State of Ohio and to Cleveland-based nonprofit Growth Opportunity Partners. The funding, made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act, was poised to bring solar power, job creation, and lower utility bills to thousands of low-income households across the state.

Congresswoman Brown releases the following statement:

“The Trump Administration is once again ripping away funding from Ohio—this time slashing $312 million meant to bring clean energy, good-paying jobs, and lower utility bills to our communities. This isn’t theoretical money. Contracts were signed, plans were in motion, and both the State of Ohio and Cleveland’s own Growth Opportunity Partners were set to deliver real savings to Northeast Ohioans.

“Despite the bluster, President Trump seems intent on raising costs on Northeast Ohioans. Let’s be clear: cutting this funding means locking families into higher utility bills and taking away their chance to free up money for food, healthcare, and other essentials. This was targeted relief for those who need it most. This move isn’t just shameful – its unlawful. I’m going to work with my colleagues to ensure Ohio families get what they were promised.”

Background:

On April 22, 2024, the Biden-Harris Administration announced $7 billion in Solar for All grants to expand clean energy access for over 900,000 low-income households nationwide. Ohio received two of the largest awards in the country:

The State of Ohio Office of Budget and Management was awarded $156,210,000 to help low- and moderate-income households achieve energy savings through residential solar deployment.

Growth Opportunity Partners, a Cleveland-based nonprofit, received $156,210,000 to lead a multistate initiative focused on a just clean energy transition in industrial heartland communities.

Geothermal

Germany Moves to Fast-track Geothermal Energy Projects

(Reuters) Germany’s cabinet approved a draft law on Aug. 6 aimed at fast-tracking the rollout of geothermal energy projects, as part of its goal to eliminate fossil fuel-based heating by 2045.

Interest in geothermal energy has surged since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered a spike in energy prices, prompting both municipal utilities and energy companies to seek new, low-carbon heating solutions.

Germany’s push to slash emissions from the building sector, where heating is a major contributor, has further fueled investment in this area.

According to a 2023 study by the Fraunhofer Institute, Germany holds some of Europe's largest geothermal reserves, with the potential to supply over a quarter of its annual heating needs. However, development has long been slowed by local opposition and complex regulatory hurdles.

The proposed legislation seeks to cut red tape by streamlining approval processes for geothermal plants, heat pumps, thermal storage and district heating pipelines.

It would classify these projects as being of “overriding public interest”—the same status granted to wind and solar energy—and introduce faster permitting through changes to mining, water and environmental laws.

The bill also sets strict deadlines for government authorities to approve projects and relaxes restrictions on geothermal exploration.

The draft law will now go to the Bundestag lower house and Bundesrat upper house for final approval.

In 2023, The US Department of Energy awarded a $114 million grant for the new nickel processing plant. Nickel is used in electric car batteries. Tesla signed a contract for 75,000 metric tons from the plant.

It's also used in computers and to strengthen steel. Retired four-star Marine General John Allen says that makes nickel a strategic asset.

""What the Pentagon's trying to do is to lock in and preserve these raw materials for the highly sophisticated technologically advanced warfare that the United States wields today,"" he said.

Talon Metals owns both the Minnesota mine and the proposed processing facility in Beulah. The Pentagon gave Talon a $20 million matching grant to look for more minerals in the US. New mines don't open very often here, and refineries to process what comes out of them are even more rare.

""The United States and Europe and other of the technologically advanced societies sort of backed themselves into an environment where we imported a lot of these materials, mostly from China,"" Allen said.

Allen is on the board of the US arm of a security-oriented think tank called GLOBESEC. They estimate China controls 75% of the world's critical metals and mining materials.

Talon vice president Jessica Johnson welcomes the federal backing.

""Across multiple administrations, I think it's clear that domestic raw materials for our supply chains, everything from clean energy technologies to our defense and national security platforms and technologies– it's a bipartisan issue,"" she said.

There's no organized opposition to the nickel plant in Beulah.

North Dakota received support in its complaint from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana.","State utility regulators have filed a complaint with a federal agency, saying a regional electrical grid planning group’s system for assessing power line needs is misguided and will cost North Dakota ratepayers money.

The North Dakota Public Service Commission on July 30 filed the complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The complaint is against the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which manages a regional electric grid that serves 15 states, including part of North Dakota, and parts of Manitoba, Canada.

In December, MISO revealed a plan for 24 transmission upgrade projects with an estimated combined cost of $22 billion.

But the PSC says the group has changed the way it evaluates the costs and benefits of transmission projects to the detriment of North Dakota.

North Dakota green lights natural gas power plant

During a meeting Thursday, Commissioner Jill Kringstad said the 24 MISO projects would help some states achieve renewable energy goals but pass some of the cost on to North Dakota ratepayers.

She called the costs “unjust and unreasonable” for North Dakota.

Commissioners estimated North Dakota’s share of the projects at $5 per month for an average customer, which the customer would pay for decades.

Of the 22 projects, two reach into the eastern edge of North Dakota. The rest of the projects are in the northern tier of MISO states, from eastern South Dakota to western Ohio.

Christmann said his objections aren’t over individual projects, but about how MISO changed its method to justify the projects.

“There is nothing to justify the kind of costs imposed on our people,” Christmann said in an interview.

North Dakota received support in its complaint from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Montana.

The southern states are not being asked to help pay for the project in the northern MISO area but Louisiana Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis objects to the cost-benefit analysis that was used.

The cost-benefit allocations used in MISO-North might some day come down to MISO-South, Lewis said.

MISO spokesperson Brandon Morris confirmed the cost allocation for the plan is on a subregional basis across the North and Central regions and does not include MISO South.

“MISO is reviewing the filing submitted to FERC,” Morris said. “The (proposed) portfolio was developed through a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement, including more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits. The portfolio supports reliability and the future needs of the system.”

While it’s not uncommon for state regulators to bring objections to MISO’s governing board, it is rare for states to join forces for a federal complaint on an issue that doesn’t apply to all members, Lewis said.

In a news release, the North Dakota PSC said its concerns were brought up to MISO during the stakeholder process but were not addressed.

Genes give instructions to enzymes, and, in turn, those enzymes help control the plant’s metabolic pathways.
But we are only beginning to understand how modifying these genes to produce more oil affects the plant’s other metabolic pathways, which are all interconnected.
Their findings will provide fellow scientists with clues for how to tweak a plant’s oil production to create the maximum amount of biofuel.
In other words, if you try to increase oil, protein goes down and vice versa.","Arabidopsis may seem like a simple plant, but at the University of Missouri, plant biochemist Jay Thelen is using it as a powerful model to explore ways to boost oil production — an important step toward creating more sustainable, plant-based energy sources.

To meet the increasing global demand for biofuels, scientists are already modifying plant genes to boost the amount of plant oil being produced. That’s because inside the plant, a complex network of metabolic pathways turns sunlight, carbon dioxide (or atmospheric carbon), water and nutrients into vital compounds including oil, the foundational ingredient of biofuel.

Genes give instructions to enzymes, and, in turn, those enzymes help control the plant’s metabolic pathways. But we are only beginning to understand how modifying these genes to produce more oil affects the plant’s other metabolic pathways, which are all interconnected.

In their new study, Thelen and his colleagues have charted how plant metabolism responds to these genetic changes. Their findings will provide fellow scientists with clues for how to tweak a plant’s oil production to create the maximum amount of biofuel.

“Because oil production utilizes central metabolic pathways, we know that engineering plants to produce more oil ultimately impacts other pathways — creating constraints on carbon supply,” said Thelen, professor of biochemistry in Mizzou’s College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources. “By using the knowledge we gained in this large-scale biological study, we can identify these metabolic bottlenecks and release these constraints through targeted engineering in order to maximize desirable products, such as oil.”

Surprising findings

One of the study’s most unexpected findings challenged a long-held observation that oil content in seeds is inversely proportional to protein. In other words, if you try to increase oil, protein goes down and vice versa. However, Thelen and colleagues found simultaneous increases in both oil and protein content in the seeds.

“The surprising co-increase in protein suggests that it might be possible to simultaneously enhance multiple valuable components within plants that are grown for both oil and protein traits, rather than being forced into a trade-off,” Thelen said. “This study of a gene knockout for a regulatory gene for fatty acid production could offer clues for the engineering of seeds with a higher overall content of desirable substances, offering greater value.”

Another unexpected result revealed an energy-wasting “futile cycle.” Even as the genetically modified plants made more oil, they also triggered processes that broke those oils down.

“We noticed that the plants upregulated pathways for lipid mobilization, seemingly breaking down the lipids (fatty acids) they were trying to overproduce,” he said. “In future research, we want to try to discover what caused this unusual metabolic response, and ultimately slow down fatty acid catabolism to minimize this wasteful cycle.”

Maximizing efficiency

The team’s long-term goal is to help develop more efficient oil-producing plants such as camelina and pennycress — fast-growing cover crops — to quickly absorb carbon dioxide and turn it into oil in the most efficient way possible.

“This carbon dioxide can be put into various products, such as simple and complex sugars, waxes, organic acids and oils,” said Thelen, who is also a principal investigator in the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center. “The goal of genetic engineering is to move as much of that carbon from those less valuable products into creating seed oil, the principal agronomic product for oilseed cover crops.”

California's share of the grants includes $250 million for community solar projects administered through the CPUC, CEC and LWDA. The grants were part of the Biden EPA's $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which the Trump administration has frozen, a move that prompted multiple lawsuits and injunctions.

The joint statement from California regulators said an EPA-approved work plan was created with stakeholder input, and the Solar for All funding was made available on March 24.

""Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate,"" the statement said. ""Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects.""

Sach Constantine, Executive Director at San Francisco-based advocacy group Vote Solar, said in a prepared statement that the EPA's ending of Solar for All grants is part of an overall attack on clean energy and access to energy solutions.

""The EPA's move to cancel Solar for All grants and claw back contractually obligated funding is deeply alarming,"" Constantine said.

On Friday, the final day to either sanction or veto the law, Lula struck down or amended 63 of the 398 provisions in a bill that, as approved by congress last month, had been regarded as the most significant setback to Brazil’s environmental protections in four decades.

Environmental campaigners had urged the president to veto the bill in its entirety, but many welcomed Lula’s decision and are now calling on civil society to mobilise to pressure lawmakers into upholding the vetoes.

That will not be an easy task for the Lula administration, given that the largely opposition-controlled congress has repeatedly defeated key government proposals – including by overturning previous presidential vetoes.

An escalating political standoff further complicates the challenge: lawmakers aligned with former president Jair Bolsonaro are blocking legislative activity, demanding the passage of a bill granting amnesty to the far-right leader and hundreds of others accused of taking part in a failed coup attempt in 2022.

Lula’s ministers – speaking at a press conference in the capital Brasília in the president’s absence – expressed confidence in the government’s position.

After Congress approved the bill last month, the environment minister, Marina Silva, described it as a “death blow” to Brazil’s licensing framework, saying that it threatened the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030.

But on Friday, she said the revised legislation meant that “our targets to reach zero deforestation, and our goal to cut CO2 emissions by between 59% and 67%, remain fully on track”.

One of the most heavily criticised provisions of the bill would have allowed projects classified as having “medium” environmental impact to obtain licences through a self-declared online form – without prior studies or regulatory review.

That clause was among those vetoed, as was another that would have excluded most of the Indigenous and Quilombola communities from having a say in licensing decisions affecting their territories.

Lula, however, preserved a provision allowing the federal government to fast-track “strategic” or “priority” projects – a move that could pave the way for oil exploration at the mouth of the Amazon River. The project has been championed by the president, but heavily criticised by environmentalists.

Groups such as the NGO SOS Mata Atlântica welcomed the vetoes, but said they would carry out a detailed review of both the discarded and remaining provisions “to continue mobilising civil society and ensure that congress upholds the gains secured”.

ActionAid’s climate justice specialist, Jessica Siviero, said that “a full veto was essential, but the points that were struck down still represent progress”.

Mighty Earth’s global director, João Gonçalves, also welcomed Lula’s vetoes and said he hoped congress would uphold them, warning that “if this destructive bill becomes law – just weeks ahead of Cop30 in Belém – it threatens to erode Brazil’s credibility on the global stage.”

At Friday’s press conference, Lula’s ministers appeared careful not to criticise congress, stating that there were “positive” elements in the bill, which had been backed by agribusiness and mining interests as a way to “cut red tape” and “speed up” licensing procedures.

“We hope to be able to streamline licensing processes without compromising their quality, which is essential for environmental protection at a time of climate crisis, biodiversity loss and desertification,” said Silva.

Should Congress overturn the president’s vetoes, environmentalists and legal experts have warned the move could trigger a wave of lawsuits – both challenging the legislation itself and contesting projects approved through self-licensing – on the grounds that they violate Brazil’s constitution.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c112007fa1ad2216eb4939f7c072052531885abc/687_488_3946_3156/master/3946.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75a016eeaf71c7c087b49f2b7afc0511",N,,2025-08-08 17:03:11.399653

Today, Yasir Naqvi, Member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade and to the Secretary of State (International Development), on behalf of Minister Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, announced an investment of $2.5 million from the Energy Innovation Program (EIP) to support Ottawa-based TerraFixing in developing made-in-Canada carbon management technology.

The project aims to advance direct air capture technology designed for cold climates by scaling up CO2 capture beds. It uses structured zeolite packing — a porous mineral that traps CO2 from the air — to minimize pressure drop and improve mass transport of CO2. The goal is to fit a 1,000-tonnes-per-year unit into a shipping container, achieving costs below $100 per tonne of CO2 at a large scale.

Among many measures in House Bill 96, the legislature eliminated an exemption from sales taxes on materials contractors use to build the facilities.

But Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed that.

“You want to do things in the right doses,” Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel said Thursday, defending the decision. “You want to have data centers, you want to have new opportunities, you want to have the belief in your young people seeing that the new neat things are coming to Ohio.”

Roger Wehner, Amazon Web Services vice president for economic development, said government incentives—like tax exemptions—are just one factor when selecting new sites for new data centers.

“Every entity has a bucket of tools that they use that they see fit, and currently, the state of Ohio has those tools, and they’re available to anybody who qualifies, and if we qualify, we avail ourselves of those benefits just like every other industry can,” Wehner said Thursday.

AWS closely considers land and resource availability, he said, among other factors. And the tech giant reinvests into local communities on the other side, he said.

House Speaker Matt Huffman (R-Lima) signaled desire in July to override DeWine’s veto on the tax break when members of his chamber come back in the fall.

“The fact that data centers get a tax exemption for their sales tax for their building materials, but a guy who is building a restaurant or a house or a warehouse or something else does not,” Huffman said, “maybe that made sense 15 years ago when we were trying to get the data centers to come to Ohio.”

Research released in January from left-leaning policy firm Policy Matters Ohio showed that if it benefited project investments pledged by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft in the last two years alone, the state and its local communities will miss out on close to $1.6 billion in revenue.

Ford and South Korean company SK On began building a nearly $6 billion, 1,500-acre campus in 2022 an hour south of Louisville where — in two plants estimated to employ 2,500 people each — workers are making batteries for electric vehicles.

Farley said during the earnings call Ford’s new EV strategy is the result of consumer demand trends while regulations change. He said the company may begin to offer a few different styles, such as hybrids, range-extended EVs and some partial zero emission vehicles.

“We’ve definitely moved out launches, we’ve canceled some products, we’ve made the right choices in terms of battery chemistry change, like our (lithium iron phosphate battery cells) in Michigan,” Farley said.

“I think we’re very well-positioned for the reality of the EV market with the customers today.”

The automaker is continuing to delay launching new-generation electric vehicles in favor of smaller, affordable and profitable models, according to the Detroit Free Press. Ford has yet to make money on electric vehicle sales and projected it would likely lose up to $5 billion in related software operations this year.

During its second quarter, the company reported its Model e lost $1.3 billion, slightly more than the same time period last year. Model e is one of Ford’s all-electric vehicle.

In his weekly Team Kentucky update Thursday, Gov. Andy Beshear also hinted at yet another economic development announcement. Beshear didn’t say it was related to Ford’s Monday strategy release, but indicated another wave of good economic news for the commonwealth was on the horizon.

On Aug. 5, Beshear was in Paducah to celebrate the lease signed on a $1.5 billion facility at the US Department’s former Gaseous Diffusion Plant. And on Aug. 6, Apple said it would make a $2.5 billion investment in Harrodsburg where, soon, all glass covers for iPhones and Apple Watches sold around the world will be made.

“A $4 billion week doesn’t happen all that often, it’s actually only happened once before in the commonwealth of Kentucky’s history,” Beshear said Thursday.

“Wait until you see next week. I know it feels like a chaotic world, but there are good things happening, and when those good things happen, let’s make sure we celebrate them.”

Finance authority to hear new business

Ford’s announcement is taking place in Louisville at the same time the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority hears new business in Frankfort through the state’s Jobs Retention Act. The state program hands out performance-based tax credit agreements to companies based on cumulative investments and annual job targets.

The jobs retention policy has been on the books for almost two decades and has been amended several times since then. Local automotive industry projects have been supported in part by agreements through the state’s program over the years.

When Ford said in 2022 it would expand its Louisville presence with a $700 million investment and 500 new jobs to produce its F-Series Super Duty truck, the state’s finance authority approved an agreement for up to $430 million in tax incentives for the company.

This past December, an agreement between the state and Toyota provided that company with up to $267.5 million in tax credits based on its more than $920 million investment and 8,950 job promise for an advanced paint facility at its existing Georgetown plant. Last February, the same automaker entered an agreement with the state following an increase in future investments across the state.

GE Appliance’s June announcement it would move its washer and dryer production lines to the US at its Appliance Park in Louisville was approved for up to $113.5 million in tax incentives.

Automakers forecast tariff hits

On Thursday, Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. said it anticipates a nearly $10 billion hit from President Donald Trump’s new tariff hikes as it deals with rising costs from levies on steel, aluminum and other car parts. The company’s estimate includes some of the financial fallout its suppliers face.

“It’s honestly very difficult for us to predict what will happen regarding the market environment,” the car maker’s head of finance, Takanori Azuma, said recently.

Toyota’s forecast is the highest estimate of any company, Reuters reported.

General Motors Co. projected its tariff hit would be somewhere between $4 billion and $5 billion for the year. Ford Motor Co. expects a $3 billion hit. Stellantis NV, the maker of Jeep, Chrysler, Ram, Dodge and others, said tariffs would add nearly $2 billion to its expenses this year.

Import tariffs are expected to make shopping for a new car more difficult as auto manufacturers look for ways to offset the higher manufacturing cost.

Recent investor calls, that include billions of dollars worth of projections for how much tariffs will cost automakers, have included some discussion of whether customers will begin to foot the bill.

It’s not clear yet how the impact of tariffs might impact some auto-making factories across Kentucky.

The commonwealth is the No. 1 producer of cars, light trucks and SUVs per capita, according to the state. In 2023, Kentucky’s automotive-related exports totaled $6 billion. There are more than 550 automotive-related companies in Kentucky employing more than 106,000 people.

Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in Georgetown, about 30 minutes outside Lexington, is the automaker’s largest vehicle manufacturing plant in the world where it produces 550,000 vehicles and 600,000 engines annually.

Since operations began in May 1988, more than 14 million vehicles have rolled off the factory’s assembly lines. Full-time employment there is 9,950, according to Toyota officials.

About an hour from Lexington in Louisville, Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant employs 9,201 people. The same automaker’s Louisville Assembly Plant employs 3,330 people.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/news/business/st6k12/picture199643484/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/AP_16292548056644,N,,2025-08-08 17:02:34.580190

Lower-income Hoosiers are more likely to live in older, less energy-efficient homes that use more power. Advocates said putting solar on these homes not only lowers their energy bills, but also reduces the need for more power plants — which all electric utility customers pay for.

The funding cut comes at a time when the average Indiana resident’s bill has gone up by $28 a month since last year. Mo McReynolds directs Indianapolis’s Office of Sustainability.

“Indianapolis, compared to other cities our size, has a particularly high energy burden — meaning the ratio of an average household income that gets paid toward their utility bills. We're particularly good candidate for a program like this,"" she said.

Alison Becker is with Solar Opportunities Indiana, a coalition helping to mange the grant funding. She said, without the federal dollars, most of the solar projects the group oversees won’t move forward.

That includes plans to put solar and battery storage at libraries in lower-income, southern Indiana communities — which would help during storms when the power is out.

“The library can be made available to charge cell phones, be warm or be cool, have food available — just a place for the community to be and to be able to be safe,"" Becker said.

Texas A&M researchers are using the power of artificial intelligence to track the relationship between natural hazards and unplanned chemical emissions to help researchers and policymakers predict, and hopefully prevent, future pollution. They are utilizing incident reports and weather data collected from the Houston area since 2005, according to a report published on Wednesday.

They found that, among other breakthroughs, severe weather events like lightning and heavy rainfall can lead to chemical emissions incidents at industrial facilities, and thus generate environmental pollution.

“In this study, we pursued a data-driven understanding of how climate extremes elevate the likelihood of excessive industrial emissions,” said Dr. Qingsheng Wang, a professor of chemical engineering at Texas A&M. “This understanding is laying the groundwork for predictive tools allowing regulators and operators to anticipate natural hazard-triggered technological accidents.”

A chemical emissions incident is an unplanned release of emissions that causes unauthorized air pollutants to enter the outside environment. Severe weather often create these type of events, with some being more powerful than others.

According to Texas A&M, a chemical emissions incident happened in August 2017 after Hurricane Harvey’s floodwaters disabled the refrigeration trailers at a processing facility. Consequently, at least 350,000 pounds of chemicals eroded into the atmosphere, leading to unexpected pollution.

""Lightning and rainfall aren’t just weather forecast items; they’re leading indicators of pollution spikes,"" Haoyu Yang, a chemical engineering Ph. D. student at Texas A&M University College of Engineering, said.

Results found precipitation and lightning are the two dominant predictors of chemical emissions incidents, and therefore of increased pollution. Flooding associated with heavy rain or hurricanes can drive equipment failure, while lightning-induced power loss often forces emergency flaring.

Texas A&M believes the research can help officials and lawmakers find clean air solutions, including forecasting high-risk days with public warnings to reduce exposure to carcinogens and smog precursors released during chemical emissions incidents.

They also said back-up power and flood-proofingat facilities near neighborhoods will also decrease local pollution.

“We discovered that the strength of climate-incident correlations drifts over time, hinting at improving industrial resilience, potentially due to post-Harvey upgrades,” said Yang. “This weakens previously strong climate signals in the later years of the study. Identifying changes in the data over time is now a priority for future research.”

A new state fund created to reimburse farmers for lost crops has received more than 7,000 applications. And Renew NC, the state’s home building and repair program, is one step closer to funding after a key agreement with federal officials this week.

State lawmakers created the crop reimbursement program as part of a March aid bill. It sets out $300 million to pay farmers for crops that were washed away or destroyed last year. Two-thirds of that money is for Helene-impacted farms, and the rest is for other storms in 2024.

Applications for the program closed in May. The Department of Agriculture received around 7,500 applications total when accounting for incomplete or duplicate ones, assistant commissioner Kaleb Rathbone told the governor’s committee on western recovery.

In the months since, officials have sought to verify all of those applications. Farms will be reimbursed for their losses based on a formula outlined in state law. Payment is expected “mid-summer,” according to the department’s website.

“We can’t send money out for a category until we’ve reviewed and calculated the payments, so that nobody gets left behind,” Rathbone said.

The vast majority of applications — around 6,400 — are for farms affected by storms other than Helene. Of the roughly 1,100 Helene-impacted applicants, 500 of them involve farm infrastructure damage.

Applications remain open through the end of the year, meanwhile, for the state’s primary homebuilding and repair program, Renew NC.

Many home repairs out west have already begun — paid for by a combination of homeowners’ own capital, FEMA’s individual assistance payments and philanthropic groups. But Renew NC will be the state’s biggest effort at restoring damaged homes, primarily for low-income families.

Thus far, only single-family housing is open to applications. The state has received 920 applications so far, said Matt Calabria, director of the governor’s recovery office. Around 350 of those have been deemed eligible and will now move into scheduled inspections.

State officials do not yet have access to the $1.4 billion in federal grant funds that will fuel the program. But they signed an agreement with federal officials this week, Calabria said, a key step toward unlocking the money. Other requirements remain, like environmental reviews, before the money is made available.

In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers.
Growth Energy “The RFS is the foundation of America’s bioeconomy,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor.
“Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation’s fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation’s future.
“Investing in American biofuels strengthens our energy supply, creates good-paying jobs, and drives economic growth in communities that feed and fuel our nation.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Growth Energy—the leading voice of America’s biofuel industry—is commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which opened fuel markets to competition from homegrown biofuels produced from U.S. farm crops. Joining Growth Energy in celebration of the August 8th birthday are leaders from across the heartland, who have helped to make the RFS America’s single most successful policy for increasing U.S. energy security, holding down fuel costs, reducing emissions, and strengthening the farm economy.

Since the RFS became law in August 2005, American biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol. In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers. As a result of these benefits, the program is supported by a broad, bipartisan spectrum of stakeholders.

Growth Energy

“The RFS is the foundation of America’s bioeconomy,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it’s still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. EPA recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren’t yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.”

Farmers

“The RFS is more than a law. It’s a vital outlet for surplus grains that provides stability and prosperity to American farmers facing higher input costs and uncertain export markets,” said Bill Couser, a farmer from Iowa who grows commercial corn that he sells to local plants to be processed into fuel ethanol. “I don’t know that our family’s farm would be as strong as it is today if it weren’t for the RFS and the American biofuels industry.”

“Since the RFS was enacted, America’s net farm income has more than doubled. In Iowa alone, biofuel plants purchase more than half the state’s corn crop — transforming it into homegrown fuels, high-quality animal feed, food-grade CO2, and a host of other co-products,” said Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a third-generation corn and soybean farmer based in northwest Iowa. “It’s an integral part of the agricultural supply chain.”

Lawmakers

“For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard program has helped us produce fuel that reduces our emissions and fosters energy independence—and I’m proud to help continue leading the push in the Senate to increase the use and supply of American-grown, American-made biofuels across the country,” said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). “We’re pushing hard for our bipartisan bill to enable the year-round sale of E15 nationwide, and as founding co-chair of the Sustainable Aviation Caucus in the Senate, I’m working to bolster and help expand our nation’s sustainable aviation fuel industry. Investing in American biofuels doesn’t just help us reduce our nation’s carbon footprint—it helps lower gas prices for middle-class families and support our farmers. It’s a win-win-win that would not be possible without the RFS.”

“Over the last 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been essential to empowering heartland communities, adding value to crops grown by our hardworking farmers, securing American energy independence, and giving consumers a cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation’s fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation’s future. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump administration to ensure the RFS stays strong, so we can keep delivering for Iowa’s famers, biofuel producers, and rural communities.”

“Nebraska is the nation’s second-largest producer of ethanol, and much of that is made possible by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established 20 years ago,” said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). “The RFS has played a critical role in supporting Nebraska’s ag economy, driving both the use and production of renewable fuels across the state. I look forward to continuing to work with the EPA to ensure a strong RFS that will further advance Nebraska’s biofuels industry.”

“The Renewable Fuel Standard is one of the federal government’s most successful clean fuels policies,” said Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.). “For two decades, renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have saved consumers money, supported Nebraska agriculture, cleaned our environment, and unleashed American energy.”

“For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a cornerstone of American energy independence and agricultural prosperity. As the nation’s second-largest ethanol producer, Nebraska demonstrates how the RFS program strengthens our rural economies while advancing environmental sustainability through reduced emissions and cleaner fuel alternatives,” said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.). “RFS continues to prove that American farmers and biofuel producers are essential partners in securing our energy future and meeting our nation’s climate goals.”

“For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has created incredible new opportunities for our farmers. I’ve seen firsthand the important markets it creates for our corn and soybean growers, and the cost savings it brings for folks at the pump,” said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). “As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15.”

“A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels,” said Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa). “For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation’s fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities.”

“For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has provided long-term market certainty and predictability for American biofuels producers, fuel retailers, farmers, and other market participants,” said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa). “It’s incredible to see how far we’ve come in blending more homegrown biofuels into our nation’s fuel supply—and how the RFS supports Iowa farmers and rural communities. Biofuels play a crucial role in our energy strategy to bolster energy independence and lower costs for consumers. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration and my colleagues in Congress to expand the use of biofuels as part of an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy.”

“I’m proud to support access to new markets for our nation’s farmers that strengthens our domestic energy resources,” said Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio). “Investing in American biofuels strengthens our energy supply, creates good-paying jobs, and drives economic growth in communities that feed and fuel our nation. By advancing biofuel innovation we’re building a more secure, independent, and prosperous future for the American people. As we mark 20 years of the Renewable Fuel Standard, we recognize one of the most impactful commitments our nation has made to energy security and rural prosperity.”

“For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a cornerstone of our nation’s energy policy—strengthening rural economies, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating new markets for our family farmers,” said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.). “In Illinois and across the Midwest, biofuels mean good-paying jobs, cleaner air, and opportunity. As we look ahead, we must ensure the RFS translates to affordable low-carbon options for consumers while supporting industry growth domestically. I’ll continue fighting to make sure biofuels remain a key part of America’s energy future.”",https://growthenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iStock-623071362-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 17:03:00.403771

The economic impact: $1 trillion at stake According to EPA estimates, rescinding the Endangerment Finding would roll back regulations totaling more than $1 trillion in compliance costs.
https://www.epa.gov/dockets/oar-dockets-open-public-comment Final Rulemaking – After reviewing comments, the EPA will finalize the rule.
If you’re concerned about start-stop technology, EV mandates, or the regulatory costs built into the price of your next vehicle, now is the time to speak up.
The Endangerment Finding has been the legal backbone for every major greenhouse gas rule in the last 16 years.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has just set off what may be the most consequential policy shift in the auto industry in over a decade. On Tuesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposal to rescind the controversial 2009 Endangerment Finding, a legal foundation that has been used for 16 years to justify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations impacting every car, truck, and bus sold in the U.S.

If finalized, this proposal would dismantle more than $1 trillion in regulatory mandates, including President Biden’s aggressive electric vehicle (EV) requirements, and restore consumer choice to a market long constrained by unelected bureaucrats. It would also pull the brakes on unpopular mandates like engine start-stop systems and costly EV infrastructure requirements that automakers say have driven up vehicle prices.

Why this proposal is so significant

The 2009 Endangerment Finding gave the EPA unprecedented power to regulate six greenhouse gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. It asserted that these gases—carbon dioxide among them—posed a threat to public health and welfare, opening the door for sweeping emissions mandates on the auto industry.

Since then, the EPA has used the finding to justify a series of regulations designed to force automakers toward electric vehicles and away from gasoline-powered cars. Biden’s 2024 standards, for example, require automakers to cut tailpipe emissions in half by 2032 and predict that between 35% and 56% of all new vehicles sold will be electric within the next decade. California and 11 other states have piggybacked on these standards with even stricter rules, including outright bans on gasoline-only cars by 2035.

Critics say these mandates amount to a de facto EV requirement that Congress never approved. They also argue that the Endangerment Finding was based on flawed legal reasoning and exaggerated climate risk assumptions.

“Obama and Biden’s EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said at the announcement, which was held at an auto dealership in Indiana.

The economic impact: $1 trillion at stake

According to EPA estimates, rescinding the Endangerment Finding would roll back regulations totaling more than $1 trillion in compliance costs. Automakers have spent years reengineering vehicles to meet complex emissions targets, often passing those costs on to consumers.

The American Trucking Association estimates that Biden’s electric truck mandate alone would have “crippled the supply chain, disrupted deliveries, and raised prices for American families and businesses.” ATA President and CEO Chris Spear welcomed the EPA’s move, calling it “a critical step toward saving jobs and protecting the economy.”

Indiana Governor Mike Braun, who joined Zeldin at the event, echoed that sentiment: “We can protect our environment and support American jobs at the same time. For too long, Washington has acted as if those two goals are mutually exclusive.”

Legal foundations and next steps

The EPA argues that recent Supreme Court rulings—including West Virginia v. EPA and Loper Bright v. Raimondo—make clear that major regulatory decisions of this scale must come from Congress, not federal agencies. These decisions limit the ability of the executive branch to unilaterally impose sweeping economic mandates without explicit legislative approval.

Here’s what happens next:

Public Comment Period – The proposal is now open for public comment until September 21, 2025. Americans, automakers, environmental groups, and industry stakeholders can weigh in via regulations.gov (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194). https://www.epa.gov/dockets/oar-dockets-open-public-comment

Final Rulemaking – After reviewing comments, the EPA will finalize the rule. This process must also pass through the White House Office of Management and Budget for approval.

Legal Challenges – Environmental groups and states like California are expected to sue, arguing that rescinding the Endangerment Finding violates the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which affirmed the agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

It’s likely the issue could end up before the Supreme Court again, prolonging uncertainty for automakers and consumers.

What this means for drivers

If the proposal is finalized and withstands legal challenges, it would reshape the entire automotive landscape:

End Biden’s EV mandate – Automakers would no longer be forced to prioritize EV production at the expense of gasoline-powered vehicles.

Lower vehicle costs – With fewer costly compliance requirements, manufacturers could pass savings on to consumers.

Restore consumer choice – Drivers could decide for themselves whether they want to buy EVs, hybrids, or gasoline-powered vehicles.

Block California’s bans – The EPA could revoke California’s ability to set stricter emissions rules than federal standards, affecting 11 other states that follow California’s lead.

However, the process will take time. Automakers must plan years in advance, and the Biden administration is expected to fight every step of the way.

How to make your voice heard

The public comment period gives everyday Americans a rare chance to influence federal policy. If you’re concerned about start-stop technology, EV mandates, or the regulatory costs built into the price of your next vehicle, now is the time to speak up.

You can submit your comments directly through the Federal eRulemaking Portal by searching for Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194. Comments must be received by September 21, 2025.

The EPA will also hold a virtual public hearing on August 19 and 20, with an additional session on August 21 if needed. Details are available on the agency’s website.

The bigger picture

This isn’t just about EVs. The Endangerment Finding has been the legal backbone for every major greenhouse gas rule in the last 16 years. Rolling it back would not only upend Biden’s climate agenda but also shift power back to Congress and the states.

Supporters of the rescission say it’s about restoring accountability. “We’re not saying environmental protection doesn’t matter,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who stood alongside Zeldin at the announcement. “We’re saying major policy decisions should be made by elected officials, not bureaucrats.”

Opponents, however, argue that eliminating these regulations would stall progress on climate change and undermine the transition to cleaner technologies. They vow to fight the proposal in court.

This move by the EPA could fundamentally change the future of the auto industry and the vehicles available to American drivers. Whether you support or oppose it, this proposal deserves your attention. Over the next 45 days, the agency is accepting feedback from the public—and your input can help determine whether these costly and controversial mandates remain in place or are rolled back for good.

You have a voice in this process. Make sure it’s heard.

More specifically, seventeen states had at least 5 GW of clean power installed, and 20 states generated at least 16% of their electricity from clean power sources.
By the end of the year, 79% of American clean power capacity was located in districts represented by Republicans, and 92% of Republican-held districts had at least one clean power project.","In May, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) released its 2024 Clean Power Annual Market Report. ACP found that over the year, the U.S. deployed 48.7 GW of clean power capacity, 33% more than in 2023, setting a new annual record. Moreover, of all utility-scale generation capacity added in 2024, clean energy accounted for 93%, an increase from 77% in 2023.

As a result of 2024’s additions, the nation’s total clean power capacity reached 313.4 gigawatts (GW), spanning all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. That amount of clean energy can power 75 million American residences annually. It became the first year in which utility-scale solar and wind power combined generated more energy than coal, providing almost 16% of domestic electricity.

Several clean technologies saw significant growth. The country added 33.3 GW of utility-scale solar capacity, a record amount of deployment and 55% more than the 21.4 GW that had been added in 2023. 2024’s solar additions, accounting for 64% of new capacity added during the year, brought the national cumulative solar total up to 130 GW. Plus, ACP wrote that “developers added new solar projects to the pipeline almost as fast as projects came online,” keeping the solar pipeline at around 90 GW. Shining states from the year included Kentucky, which increased its solar capacity by a factor of five year-over-year, and Louisiana, which increased its capacity by a factor of three. Of the 20 utility-scale projects exceeding 300 MW built during the year, the four largest, with capacities exceeding 500 MW, were located in Nevada, Texas, and Illinois.

11.2 GW of energy storage was added, another record and its first double-digit year, compared to the 8.3 GW that was added in 2023. 2024’s storage additions, accounting for 22% of new capacity added during the year, brought the national cumulative storage total to 29 GW. Battery storage has surged in the last half-decade; more than 95% of current capacity came online in the previous five years, and the current pipeline stands at 45 GW, following 49% year-over-year growth. Not only have battery module prices been falling, but according to ACP, storage presents a significant opportunity: “On its own, storage can provide ancillary services, smooth price spikes, and enhance grid reliability. Co-located with solar or wind, storage can enable operators to sell power into the grid when demand is highest… as well as when transmission lines are less congested.”

Although the wind industry fared less favorably in 2024, 132 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind came online, an annual installation record that brought the national cumulative total to 174 MW. This was due to South Fork Wind, the country’s biggest offshore wind project, coming online off New York’s coast. There is also 73 GW of capacity in the pipeline, enough to power 30 million American residences. In addition, in-ocean monopile construction work continues throughout the year on projects such as the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Farm, Revolution Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1.

Combined, 2024’s clean energy generation projects equate to about $70 billion in investment. “That’s more annual investment than the entire U.S. auto industry typically makes in factories and equipment each year,” ACP wrote. These investments yield approximately $4 billion in state and local tax payments and land lease payments.

To date, the country has invested more than $600 billion in clean energy. Investments in solar grew 53% year-over-year to reach $46 billion, while investments in battery storage grew 31% year-over-year to reach $17 billion. Texas brought in the most investment, with $20.8 billion, but Wyoming, Nevada, and Mississippi saw the most significant shares of investment relative to their respective gross state products.

By the end of 2024, the clean energy industry was supporting 1.4 million American jobs. 460,000 of these positions are direct jobs, spanning project development, construction, operations, maintenance, and manufacturing. There are an additional 309,000 indirect jobs along the clean energy supply chain, as well as 630,000 induced jobs that benefit from the investment in their communities. ACP wrote, “Every job directly employed in the respective technology supported an estimated additional 2.6 jobs in wind and offshore wind, 2.0 jobs in battery storage, and 1.9 jobs in solar.” Although California and Texas accounted for the most jobs, Nevada had the highest concentration of jobs relative to its population, at 1.49%.

The clean energy revolution has provided tangible benefits for the entire country. Throughout 2024, 48 states added at least one utility-scale renewable project. Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana were particularly notable, entering the top fifteen for clean power project additions. Last year, Mississippi added ten times the capacity it had in the previous year. By the end of the year, clean power projects were located in all 50 states. More specifically, seventeen states had at least 5 GW of clean power installed, and 20 states generated at least 16% of their electricity from clean power sources. However, conservative areas have seen the most impact. 77% of clean energy capacity added in 2024 was in red districts. By the end of the year, 79% of American clean power capacity was located in districts represented by Republicans, and 92% of Republican-held districts had at least one clean power project.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/509355241_10161486041338775_2712739522652549108_n-1-e1754574856200.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:15:42.987030

With the clock ticking on these federal tax credits, now is the time to act to ensure you maximize your savings.","If you've been considering a switch to money-saving, environmentally friendly home improvements, time is running out. Soon, the federal tax credits that have made clean energy upgrades affordable will disappear by the end of this year.

What's happening?

As EnergySage reports, several consumer tax credits for solar, heat pump systems, electric vehicles, and more are being cut at the end of the year due to President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which was signed into law on July 4.

The cuts are happening as part of a broader effort to reduce federal spending and streamline government incentives. Supporters argue it could be a good thing by encouraging innovation in the private sector and shifting the market toward self-sustaining clean energy solutions without long-term government dependency.

However, the tax credits were originally scheduled to last for at least another decade, instead of ending after Dec. 31. The sudden nature of these cuts has left homeowners rushing to make last-minute energy-efficient upgrades before the financial benefits disappear.

The impending cuts to solar installations are one of the main cuts on the bill that have new homeowners worried. Installing rooftop solar panels is a great way to slash monthly energy bills, with some homeowners reporting that their bills were reduced to $0. Switching to solar also significantly reduces carbon emissions by replacing electricity from dirty energy sources with clean, renewable energy.

Why are these cuts important?

These tax credit cuts reduce the financial incentives that have made energy-efficient home upgrades, like solar panels, more affordable and accessible to millions of homeowners.

Without them, the upfront cost of going green increases significantly, potentially slowing adoption and stalling progress toward climate and energy goals.

The fallout of these cuts will likely increase homes running on traditional dirty-energy-based sources, leading to higher carbon emissions, greater strain on the power grid, and a missed opportunity to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

What's being done about these cuts?

With the clock ticking on these federal tax credits, now is the time to act to ensure you maximize your savings. EnergySage offers a free, extremely helpful tool to compare local solar installers, ensuring you get the best deal.

Governor Lamont: Trump Administration’s Termination of Solar for All Program Will Prevent Thousands of Connecticut Households From Accessing Clean, Affordable Solar Energy

(HARTFORD, CT) – Governor Ned Lamont today said that U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) announcement that it is attempting to terminate the popular and critically important Solar for All grant program means that thousands of Connecticut households will no longer be able to access the financial assistance needed to convert their homes to clean, affordable solar energy.

The EPA notified the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) late last night that it is immediately terminating the $62.45 million grant the state secured through the program last year. Reports indicate that other grant recipients have also been informed that their grants are being terminated.

“At a time when households could benefit from transitioning to solar energy now more than ever, the Trump administration is attempting to terminate a program that would lower energy costs for families and businesses while also delivering clean energy,” Governor Lamont said. “These funds belong to the taxpayers of Connecticut. This action by EPA is unlawful, and we will be working with other states to counter this action.”

“Once again, Donald Trump is seizing funds intended to lower costs for American families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Attorney General William Tong said. “These funds were passed by Congress to reduce carbon pollution and to save money for low-income families getting socked right now by utility bills. We are evaluating all legal options in coordination with our multistate partners to protect Connecticut families and Connecticut funds.”

“This action by the Trump EPA cuts off access to clean, affordable solar energy for thousands of Connecticut residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “Connecticut’s Solar for All program would help residents, particularly those in multi-family affordable housing, and communities, access the benefits of clean solar energy and the much-needed cost savings it can provide. This program would also help us improve our air quality, which is among the worst in the nation, and make our electric grid more resilient. EPA’s action runs completely counter to our efforts to bring affordable, clean, and reliable energy to Connecticut residents.”

Established by the EPA in early 2024, the Solar for All program was created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and $7 billion was committed toward the program. The funds were to be used to help expand the availability and accessibility of clean and affordable solar energy in homes and communities nationwide, particularly those in low-income and disadvantaged communities. The program was designed to cut energy bills by an estimated 20% annually for participating households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, translating to hundreds of dollars in savings per year for people who could otherwise not access these technologies. Additionally, the program was estimated to create 200,000 jobs nationally and avoid 30 million metric tons of carbon emissions.

Shortly after its creation, DEEP applied for a grant on behalf of the state through an application it submitted in collaboration with the Connecticut Green Bank, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the Connecticut Department of Housing, and the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, among others. On April 22, 2024, DEEP was notified by the EPA that it had secured a $62.45 million grant, and the funds were obligated on July 12, 2024.

DEEP’s plans were to use the grant to help thousands of Connecticut households transition their homes to solar energy, with a particular emphasis on prioritizing multi-family affordable housing units. DEEP’s plans were to build on the success of the state’s existing programs that support solar and energy storage system deployment, including the Residential Renewable Energy Solutions program and the Energy Storage Solutions program.

Connecticut is among 60 recipients that had secured grants through this program.

The Nevada Solar for All program is designed to increase energy affordability and reliability for more than 50,000 Nevadans and create nearly 1,000 new jobs.

As the highest per capita award of any state based on eligible population, NCEF’s grant is among the most impactful in the nation and has already begun delivering results. The grant funds are legally obligated to NCEF under a valid contract with the federal government, and the termination is in violation of EPA’s own terms and conditions and contractual obligations, as well as contrary to congressional intent.

“The federal government’s termination of Solar for All means that tens of thousands of Nevada households will continue to struggle with rising utility bills with no hope of relief,” said Kirsten Stasio, CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund. “We expect legal action to be taken to restore access to terminated Solar for All grants. In the meantime, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund will continue to provide tangible solutions to Nevada communities through our other programs.”

EPA’s action does not impact grant funds that have already been spent by NCEF, but it pauses the organization’s ability to continue to implement the Nevada Solar for All program. EPA’s termination notice states that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) provides EPA with the authority to rescind unobligated Solar for All funds. Because the grant funds awarded to NCEF are obligated funds, EPA does not have the authority to rescind NCEF’s Solar for All funds.

Solar power is a proven technology that lowers energy costs, creates well-paying jobs, and supports more resilient communities. NCEF remains committed to expanding access to these benefits. While this termination notice is a temporary setback, NCEF will keep helping households, businesses, and communities through its other programs that are funded by other sources of private, public, philanthropic, and federal funds.

The sun has always been a resource for Mississippi, drawing tourists to the Gulf and Magnolia State lakes and reservoirs. And, farmers need it most of all to nurture the work they do.

However, harnessing the power of the sun has been an investment being made across the state, from universities to businesses, electrical associations, and even homeowners. Solar farms significantly contribute to Mississippi’s economy through job creation, private investment, and increased tax revenue. Of the energy sources available in Mississippi, natural gas provides 72.6%, nuclear is at 16.1%, coal is 6.6%, other renewables are 3.7% and solar is only one percent according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Solar farms can be a boon to local economies as their private investment helps generate millions in tax revenue for public services and schools and creates hundreds of jobs during construction.

However, to build a solar farm or plant—the terms are interchangeable—the Mississippi Public Service Commission must first approve any project. The MPSC is responsible for issuing certificates for electric generating facilities, including solar facilities. When considering applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for solar facilities, the commission conducts a thorough review process to ensure that the project meets certain criteria. The approval process involves a comprehensive review of various factors, including technical feasibility and financial viability, environmental impact and compliance with regulations, grid reliability and transmission system capacity, as well as potential benefits and costs to ratepayers.

MPSC Chairman Chris Brown offered some updates to the solar industry in Mississippi.

“To date, the Commission has approved construction of 54 solar generating facilities. The Commission’s authority pertains to solar facilities that would fit the definition of an electric generation ‘Facility’ under the Public Utility Act,” said Brown.

The very first solar project’s petition approved by the Commission dates back to December 2014 when three Entergy solar pilot projects were approved. These three facilities, located in Lincoln, Hinds, and DeSoto counties, came online in June 2016. Three Entergy Mississippi solar projects began operation in June. That group of facilities initially generated enough power for 175 homes annually.

Then, in June 2017, the largest facility (at the time) became operational in Hattiesburg—a 52-megawatt solar power plant that could supply enough energy for 8,000 homes with 220,000 solar panels spread across 600 acres.

Solar facilities in Greenwood, Kiln, Lucedale and Lyon came online as well with each site producing 100 kilowatts or less from 378 panels. Even with 54 current solar facilities, the MPSC continues to receive requests.

“There are currently six Petitions for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity pending before the Commission regarding the construction of new utility-scale solar facilities in Mississippi,” said Brown.

Delving into the benefits, Brown noted, “Solar is one part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy. Our priority remains ensuring that Mississippians have access to energy that is available, affordable, and reliable every hour of every day.”

Entergy Mississippi CEO and President, Haley Fisackerly, said solar was part of former Governor Haley Barbour’s thinking in the mid 2000s.

“He was putting a lot of focus on economic development,” said Fisackerly. “And, even he then knew that energy and electricity were going to be a huge, huge component. He used to always say, ‘We need an all of the above strategy.’ And that’s definitely what we’re looking at here.”

Fisackerly explained, “Our supply plan going forward is that we will be adding more solar facilities. We will also be adding new state-of-the-art gas generation units that are cleaner and more efficient to operate. This ADAPT not only brings significant capital investments into Madison County, but we will also need to make capital investments in five other counties.”

The Delta area will see new solar plants as Entergy has “been working with local officials both in Bolivar County over building a new solar facility there at the site of the old Delta plant north of Cleveland, and then we’re also working with officials up in DeSoto County, a large facility that we’ll build on land that at once was going to be a coal plant 50 years ago that never was built and now we’ll be putting solar facilities on that these are products that Amazon Web Services demanded and are paying the incremental cost for and so they’ll be on the grid to create benefits to all customers but they’re paying the incremental cost for that we are negotiating three other deals.”

At the university level, Mississippi State University is utilizing part of its campus to build a solar farm that will help power the Starkville campus and educate students for careers in the solar industry. The largest on-campus solar facility in the Southeastern Conference is part of a 30-year renewable energy efficiency project. Located on a four-acre field between R.L. Jones Circle and Blackjack Road, the 3,420 solar panel installation will produce about 2.4 million kilowatt-hours of energy annually, generating 2,400 average Renewable Energy Credits, or RECs, and saving—when combined with LED and other retrofit projects—$885,000 per year—plus an additional savings of $265,000 through a one-time rebate incentive from Tennessee Valley Authority.

“We’re taking innovative action now to generate renewable, sustainable power right here on campus. This solar structure is a visible symbol of Mississippi State’s commitment to reach our clean energy goals,” said Saunders Ramsey, Executive Director of MSU’s Campus Services. “It’s an exciting time and a mission that the entire campus community can champion.”

He further explained that the 30-year plan began in 2012, and clean energy development and production is the primary aim.

“Clean energy generation accounts for 45% of the total campus carbon reduction goal, with the second highest category—lighting and equipment retrofits—accounting for 20% of that goal. This combination will bring the university a huge increase in energy savings and make significant strides in the plan’s two most critical emission reduction areas,” said Ramsey.

Upgrades and solar modules together will help MSU achieve a reduction of 7,548 metric tons of carbon annually and save a total of 10,784,865 kilowatt-hours of energy per year.

University campuses across the U.S. are uniquely positioned to engage in solar energy projects for more reasons than just saving money. Les Potts, MSU interim vice president for Finance and Administration and CFO, explained as solar farms continue to develop, more Mississippi landowners and utilities will consider the use of solar power on their property.

“With our land-grant mission, we have always helped Mississippians make the most of their natural resources,” said Potts. “By building and managing a solar farm of our own, we will be better prepared to advise stakeholders taking on similar endeavors.”

Another benefit of the university’s solar farm will be educational. Students will have access to pre-professional, hands-on learning in areas such as design, production, and solar farm maintenance and management.

Solar projects generate tax revenue for local communities, which can be used to fund public services such as schools. A study on a solar project in Lamar County projected tax revenue ranging from $1,032,145 to $19,937,756 over a ten-year period, according to The University of Southern Mississippi. Solar projects across the state have attracted more than $4.5 billion in private investment. Although land used for solar farms can be agricultural, the actual impact is only 0.22% of farm acreage. Those acres are leased for anywhere from $700 to $2,000 per acre, per year. There’s increasing interest in using land under and around solar panels for farming activities, such as grazing or growing crops, which can help boost the local economy, according to Mississippi State University.

Solar farms continue to evolve with technological advancements. Essentially, solar panels are mounted on structures called racking that sit on posts, raising the panels above the ground, and they occupy less than 5% of the land. There is also significant open space under the panels, in the rows and buffer areas, to plant site-specific grasses and other vegetation that benefit the site and ecosystem.

The racking features smart solar trackers that slowly and quietly rotate throughout the day, following the sun to boost solar energy output. These smart trackers also serve other important functions, such as protecting solar panels from hailstorms, high winds, and snow accumulation.

In 2024 alone, 10 solar production sites connected to the grid with more than a dozen more on the way in the next three years. In Hinds County, the Soul City Solar site received approval by the Hinds County Planning Commission in June. According to a Mississippi Today article, “The company in charge of the project, Virginia-based Apex Clean Energy, said it plans to begin construction next year and have its panels operating by 2027.”

Apex has collaborated with private landowners over the past four years to secure lease agreements for roughly 6,000 acres. Soul City is planned to generate 396 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 95,000 homes. This power production would make Soul City the largest solar project in Mississippi.

The article noted that Apex says the project will generate roughly $150 million in county tax revenue over the initial 30-year lifespan of the facility, in addition to 10 full-time jobs and 400 construction jobs. Several calls and emails to Apex were not answered or returned for this article.

One key factor in bringing solar farms online is that Mississippi is part of a transmission line sharing agreement organization, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator Inc., an Independent System Operator and Regional Transmission Organization that provides open-access transmission service in various parts of the United States and Canada. Without this, the solar farms would not be feasible as the projected cost to build these transmission lines from scratch is estimated at $3 million per mile.

As solar panel efficiency increased and prices began to decrease in the 2000s, interest in renewable energy started to grow. Mississippi’s abundant sunshine, combined with a rising awareness of environmental issues, created a favorable environment for solar expansion. Will Hegman founded his Mississippi Solar LLC as the first commercial contractor in the state with a Solar and Wind Specialty License. After working in the industry for a few years, Hegman passed away and his widow sold the company to John and Virginia Wilbanks, who moved it from the Jackson area to Eupora, where they serve the entire state, including both commercial and residential customers. Michael McCoy provides sales and service and explained more of how solar is being implemented in Mississippi.

“I started in this business in 2021, and it was really starting to take off. And as I learned more, and as the Inflation Reduction Act got passed and had the nice tax incentive or tax credit, then that coupled with a USDA grant for small commercials, and agriculture, we were able to put in quite a few systems and develop a pretty strong base out there for referrals, and it’s just grown from there,” said McCoy.

McCoy noted the company has been working with a few ag-related projects including a greenhouse project in Coldwater, two chicken house projects in Macon and more are coming in.

“We’re just sprinkling in residential solar along the way and doing an off-grid system here and there. It’s just been a real good mix. Unless we’re adding batteries, what we’re doing is complementing the power we get from the grid or they get from the grid,” he explained. “The solar is there and if you have a bright, sunshiny day, you might not pull any power from the grid. But then there may be days when it’s raining, and so it’s a supplement or a complement from the grid.”

In addition to chicken farms and greenhouses, McCoy has quoted work for catfish farmers and is looking for more ways to implement solar applications on both roofs and ground mounts.

“We’ve done probably 30- to 40-percent of those have been ground mounts, and it varies at times to more. With our roof mounts, we go between the different types of metal roofing, which we have solutions for all of those, and we have quite a few asphalt shingles that we’ve worked with. The solar panels go to protect the roof and makes that shingle roof last longer.”",https://msbusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-fav-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:10:24.148421

The Primacy Certainty Act of 2025 would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rule on state applications to regulate Class VI injection wells within 180 days—otherwise the application automatically takes effect after 210 days if a state already enforces a similar program.

The measure also directs the EPA to appoint a dedicated liaison for state coordination, tap Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds for permit processing, and report annually to Congress on staffing and resource needs.

“Far too often, bureaucratic red tape gets in the way of those who know the energy industry best, stifling production and disincentivizing innovation,” said Rep. Pfluger. “Texans lead the way in efficient energy production across the country.

“Giving states the authority to regulate Class VI wells will cut down on lengthy review times and redundant bureaucratic red tape,"" said Rep. Crenshaw. ""Class VI wells, used to store captured carbon, are a net benefit to the economy and the environment – a win for everyone. I’m proud to lead this legislation with Congressman Pfluger to ensure energy companies have a timely approval process for building out these wells, and to help states act quickly to review these vital projects.”

Class VI wells are a critical component for reliable energy projects that use carbon capture. Long-standing permitting delays at the EPA have kept states from implementing this technology, stalling investment, delaying projects, and creating regulatory uncertainty. By setting firm deadlines and allowing automatic approval if the EPA fails to act, the bill gives states the clarity and authority they need to move forward.",https://pfluger.house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:10:39.897811

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.
Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.
§48 – Energy Credit The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.
FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.","This is an updated version of the alert published on July 4.

President Trump signed H.R.1, commonly referred to as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (the ""Act"") into law on July 4, 2025. Below are our summaries of the amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations.

The focus of the changes in the Act are as follows:

Special rules apply to wind and solar, including (i) a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for facilities beginning construction after July 4, 2026, (ii) removal of ""energy property"" under section 48 from 5-year MACRS depreciation, and (iii) amendments to the applicable domestic content percentages under section 48E;

Enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, including (i) application of the ""material assistance"" rules to wind and solar facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, (ii) extending the period for assessment to 6 years for a deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"", and (iii) introducing accuracy-related penalties for understatements of income tax by more than 1% due to overstating the ""material assistance cost ratio"" of property qualifying for credits under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E;

Codification of the beginning of construction rules in IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, for purposes of the FEOC requirements;

""Metallurgical coal"" is eligible for the advanced manufacturing production credit under section 45X in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, and until Dec. 31, 2029; and

Clean hydrogen production facilities beginning construction before Jan. 1, 2028, remain eligible for credits under section 45V, with no applicable FEOC requirements.

Reference Guide for Amendments to IRA Tax Credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act:

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the Act, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after the year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property continues to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property continues to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits terminate for wind and solar facilities that (i) begin construction after July 4, 2026, and (ii) are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, are not subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar will phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill initially passed by the House of Representatives included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property will be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2027) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit is allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) are apparently not subject to the rule above.

Observation: Residential solar electric property is not subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers is still eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 may qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009, has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power are eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is fixed at 30% and can not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh does not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance is no longer necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate can not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the base credit amount is the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026).

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit terminates for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027; and

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit is terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently do not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate phases out based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, are not credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate phases out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) is credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, is not credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the Act), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules are required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components are credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers may still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period is extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and Treasury will provide distinct emissions rates for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z is not credit eligible, and Treasury is authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury is authorized to prescribe rules for sales to related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (and fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 that has not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) is not allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF does not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) does not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A is extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount is increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and is in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit may be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the “tech-neutral” ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

As of July 4, 2025, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification will not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§48D – Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

For qualified property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is increased to 35%.

Observation: An advanced manufacturing facility must begin construction before Jan. 1, 2027, to be eligible for credits under section 48D.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The Act does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" are prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X than to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;19

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or21

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally means 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" also means a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale does not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" is determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentages are:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentages are:

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Act codifies that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury is required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027, applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Treasury must issue material assistance safe harbor tables by Dec. 31, 2026. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier is required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, is not included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification introduces an additional layer of complexity. The statute further authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity may be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty applies to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" means a disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" causes an ""excessive payment"" and incurs the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification is required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12122_4252.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:12:49.009396

Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative, awarded $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds contributed to solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.

It’s part of the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Democratic Reps. Don Davis (NC-01), Deborah Ross (NC-02), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), and Alma Adams (NC-12) wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the termination.

“At a time when energy costs and demand are both rapidly increasing, it is concerning that your agency is considering an action that may violate federal law — Congress has already appropriated the funding — and would increase household energy costs for millions of Americans while jeopardizing thousands of jobs across a wide cross section of states,” the members wrote.

The four representatives also wrote that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and its coalition partners — the NC Clean Energy Fund, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center, and Advanced Energy — have an award agreement with the EPA to assist with designing and implementing the state’s Solar for All program.

Zeldin posted a video online denouncing the program and saying the cuts would benefit American taxpayers.

“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” he said.

A federal judge ruled in April that the EPA cannot freeze contracts awarded to nonprofits under the Biden administration, States Newsroom previously reported.

That decision could set an example for potential lawsuits due to stare decisis — the legal principle of following precedent in court.

Michelle “Meech” Carter, clean energy campaigns director at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said the program supported at least 12,000 North Carolina households through solar installations and enabled upgrades like repairs and replacements.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, some individuals and households in western North Carolina were without power for days, weeks, and even months.

“Folks in the west desperately need to be more independent with their energy sources,” Carter said. “Installing solar on our most vulnerable homes is what’s going to help us achieve energy independence and support our communities that were affected by disasters.”

Carter described the termination as a “consistent removal of any backstops” for people trying to lower their energy bills or protect themselves from disasters.

David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the program created jobs and lowered residential power bills for families.

Last month, Republicans stripped funding for the IRA’s clean energy tax credits in their budget reconciliation bill.

“Republicans promised to help working Americans, then wiped out the investments that make electricity more affordable and support millions of American jobs,” said Hickenlooper. “Abandoning our booming clean energy economy won’t bring us closer to energy independence, and certainly won’t help working people.”

The Republican budget bill guts hundreds of billions in Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) clean energy investments, including tax credits for wind and solar. The cuts will increase the average American’s electricity bills between $100-400 per year, force an estimated 300 U.S. factories to close or never open, and eliminate 830,000 American jobs by 2030.

SANTIAGO, DELHI, CHILE, August 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Seventh Meeting of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) Regional Committee for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) concluded in Santiago, Chile, reaffirming the region’s strong commitment to advancing solar cooperation and fast-tracking the clean energy transition.

Welcoming delegates, H.E. Diego Pardow Lorenzo, Minister of Energy of Chile, reaffirmed the host country’s support for ISA’s mission to deliver affordable solar solutions and expand regional partnerships.

“Latin America’s future lies in a diversified energy matrix. In Chile, our journey from hydro-dependence to solar leadership has shown that clean energy, supported by long-term contracts and private investment, can lower costs, boost resilience, and empower communities. Our focus now is on extending solar operational hours through storage and ensuring benefits reach our most vulnerable households. Regional cooperation is essential, only together can we scale technologies, share knowledge, and secure a competitive, sustainable energy future for our people.”

H.E. Kerryne Zennelle James, Minister for Climate Resilience, the Environment and Renewable Energy of Grenada, chaired the meeting in her capacity as Vice President of the ISA LAC Region, calling for strong leadership to turn ambition into action.

“Latin America and the Caribbean are global leaders in renewable energy, with 65% of our power already sourced from renewables, double the global average. But the path ahead is uneven, especially for small island states like Grenada. We are committed to a clean, resilient future through clear national policies, ongoing solar deployments, and strong partnerships. ISA’s strategic shift from ambition to action is timely, and this Regional Committee is a crucial platform to align our priorities and unlock collective progress.”

H.E. Abhilasha Joshi, Ambassador of India to Chile, reaffirmed India’s long-standing support for ISA and commitment to South-South cooperation for sustainable energy.

“With 116 GW of solar capacity and renewable energy targets of 50% of capacity from renewables set for 2030 already met five years ahead of schedule, we are working closely with partners across Latin America and the Caribbean to share solutions, catalyse finance, and drive innovation in solar energy. Together, through ISA, we can align regional priorities, promote joint R&D, and build a resilient and sustainable energy future.”

Mr. Ashish Khanna, Director General of ISA, outlined the LAC region’s strategic importance in the global solar landscape and presented ISA’s four-pillar vision: mobilising catalytic finance, strengthening institutional capacities, enabling regional platforms, and scaling innovation and solar technologies.

“With 26 countries now part of ISA in the LAC region, a 50% rise since 2021, the momentum is clear. With nine Caribbean countries agreeing to sign a joint declaration on SIDS, to work together on an aggregate e-procurement platform, establish a regional Centre of Excellence within the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), announce the winners of the LAC SolarX Startup Challenge at COP30 in Belém, and deepen the partnership to enable private sector participation in the region through an MoU with the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), this presents a concrete vision and action plan for the LAC region. This is a clear shift from ambition to action.”

Key Outcomes and Announcements

Country Partnership Framework exchange between ISA and Grenada

The Country Partnership Framework will provide a structured approach for ISA and Grenada to collaborate on solar energy initiatives and support Grenada’s clean energy transition. Areas of collaboration will include strategic planning, regulatory support, technology development, capacity building, and solar deployment. The first CPF for the region was signed between ISA and Cuba earlier this year in New Delhi, India.

Pledge of Support adopted by leaders from Small Island Developing States (SIDS) for the ISA SIDS Platform

A transformative digital initiative anchored by ISA and the World Bank, the platform aims to accelerate inclusive, climate-resilient energy access across island nations. Nine Caribbean countries, Antigua & Barbuda, Belize, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts & Nevis, Suriname, and Trinidad & Tobago, signed a Declaration of Intent at the 7th ISA Regional Committee Meeting to launch the SIDS Solar Platform. The platform will boost solar adoption through joint procurement, lower costs, and build regional capacity, advancing clean energy and resilience across island nations.

ISA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) have extended their MoU

The renewed MoU reinforces a shared commitment to accelerate solar deployment across the LAC region. It focuses on mobilising climate-aligned financing through platforms like the Global Solar Facility; building technical capacity via regional trainings, peer learning, and data sharing; harmonising policies; co-developing solar applications in agriculture, mobility, mini-grids, and storage; and supporting national planning through joint workplans, working groups, and outreach forums.

ISA and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) sign strategic MoU

This partnership will expand energy access and resilience through solar energy, support small island states with capacity-building and technical assistance, unlock catalytic finance for solar projects, and drive policy harmonisation and knowledge exchange. ISA and OECS aim to accelerate a sustainable, secure energy future for the Eastern Caribbean.

ISA hosts the SolarX Startup Challenge 2025 for the LAC region

The third edition of the Challenge, following successful editions in Africa and the Asia-Pacific, is open for applications until 15 August 2025. It seeks innovative, scalable, and cost-effective solar solutions addressing local energy challenges. The initiative aims to foster entrepreneurship, strengthen local ecosystems, and build capacity to accelerate solar adoption across the LAC region.

In his keynote address, H.E. Paulo Roberto Soares Pacheco, Brazilian Ambassador to Chile and representative of the incoming COP30 Presidency, stressed that access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy is inseparable from the fight against climate change and the path to sustainable development. He welcomed ISA’s efforts to scale solar solutions in LDCs and SIDS, emphasising the importance of cooperation and targeted support to accelerate the transition.

The meeting brought together ministers, ambassadors, senior government officials, industry leaders, and development partners from across Latin America and the Caribbean. Deliberations focused on accelerating the clean energy transition, scaling solar deployment in small island states, mobilising finance, strengthening partnerships, and fostering innovation to sustainably meet the region’s growing energy needs.

Consumers are racing to buy electric vehicles before a fast-approaching deadline to claim tax credits worth up to $7,500, according to auto analysts.

Legislation championed by Republicans on Capitol Hill and signed by President Donald Trump in July eliminates the tax breaks — available for new, used and leased EVs — after Sept. 30.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act had originally offered the tax breaks to consumers through 2032.

""We're expecting Q3 may be [a] record for EV sales because of the tax incentives going away,"" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a senior analyst at Cox Automotive.

""People are rushing out"" to buy, she said.

'Significant volume' of EV sales

Consumers purchased nearly 130,100 new EVs in July, the second-highest monthly sales tally on record, behind roughly 136,000 sold in December, according to Cox Automotive data. The July figures represent a 26.4% increase from June and nearly 20% increase year-over-year, Streaty said.

The share of EV sales in July also accounted for about 9.1% of total sales of passenger vehicles that month, the largest monthly share on record, according to Cox.

""We're seeing significant volume in new EVs,"" said Liz Najman, director of market insights at Recurrent, an EV marketplace and data provider.

Meanwhile, there were nearly 36,700 used EVs sold in July, a record monthly high, Cox data shows.

Specific EV models — the Chevy Equinox EV, Honda Prologue and Hyundai IONIQ 5 — also saw record-breaking sales last month, Najman said.

There were 8,500 Equinox EVs sold in July, the highest monthly EV total in the U.S. for any model outside of Tesla, which is the market leader, Najman said.

(This comes as Tesla's sales have declined for two consecutive quarters, by about 12% year-over-year in Q2 and 9% in Q1, according to Cox data.)

$7,500 tax credit puts EVs near price parity

The tax credits — worth up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs — aim to make EV purchases more financially enticing for consumers.

The EV tax breaks were one of many policies the Biden administration adopted to try try to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is the largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.

EVs are ""unambiguously better"" for the environment than traditional cars with an internal combustion engine, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

However, while EVs tend to be cheaper over the lifecycle of car ownership relative to traditional gasoline vehicles, they generally carry a higher upfront cost, analysts said.

The average transaction price for all new passenger vehicles (aside from battery electric vehicles) in July was $48,078, according to Cox data.

The average for new EVs was $55,689, before any dealer incentives and tax credits, Cox said. If the purchase were to qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit, it'd be near price parity, around $48,189.

The price gap between EV and gasoline cars ""no longer exists,"" Tom Libby, an analyst at S&P Global, wrote in July. The disappearance of the federal tax credits ""jeopardizes"" price competitiveness, he wrote.

States and utilities may offer additional financial incentives for EVs, depending on where consumers live, analysts said.

EV dealers boost incentives

Dealers are also seeking to capitalize on the upcoming Sept. 30 deadline, stoking a sense of consumer urgency to boost sales, analysts said.

""$7,500 Federal Tax Credit Ending,"" was in bold lettering at the top of Tesla's home page as of early afternoon Friday. ""Limited Inventory — Take Delivery Now,"" the automaker wrote underneath.

Sept. 30 is the date by which consumers must take ownership of the car (essentially, be driving it off the lot) to qualify for an EV tax credit.

Beyond the tax breaks, dealers are also offering relatively generous financial benefits to entice consumers.

They provided about $9,800 of additional financial incentives, on average, to new-EV buyers in July, worth about 17.5% of the average transaction price, Cox data shows.

That share is the highest percentage dating to October 2017, which was before the ""new era of EV adoption"" when monthly sales volume was quite low, Streaty said.

EV sales are likely to ""collapse"" in the fourth quarter of 2025, once the tax credit expires and the market adjusts to a new financial reality, she said.

Used EVs are likely to be a bright spot in the near term, analysts said.

Growth has been accelerating, and most buyers today already don't qualify for the $4,000 tax break.

The new budget law delivers deep cuts for programs like renewable energy, tree-planting, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It also includes boons for oil drilling and exploration, and increases demand for timber from national forests. White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers told Grist that its policies will “turbocharge energy production” and “deliver further relief to American families and businesses.”

But one month since its signing, the Republican megabill seems to be doing the opposite. Program administrators, energy experts, and tribal leaders across the country said there is chaos and confusion as they wait to hear the fate of IRA-funded programs worth billions of dollars.

Grist reports from four locations on how local groups are wading through the cuts and uncertainty.

Appalachia

In the days and weeks following Hurricane Helene last September, most communities across western North Carolina sat in a complete electrical blackout. Sundance Power Systems, a small solar company in the town of Weaverville, partnered with the energy nonprofit Footprint Project to restore power by deploying dozens of microgrids.

“We loaded solar panels and batteries up in the back of our ’97 Chevy, and we went around and started providing power to people who didn’t have it,” said Dave Hollister, CEO of Sundance Power Systems.

Hollister and colleagues at other clean energy companies soon noticed a trend: Areas with solar panels installed before the storm seemed to fare well in Helene’s aftermath, leading them to wonder whether the systems could not only help restore power to impacted communities, but also prepare the region for its next storm.

The IRA clean energy tax credits that made solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, and other renewable energy home modifications financially accessible are now being rolled back due to the Republican budget bill.

“Tax credits were part of the business model here in North Carolina,” Hollister said. “It’s been an important part of giving folks the ability to choose renewable energy as their preferred energy source.”

Admittedly, the IRA tax credits often disproportionately benefitted wealthy families, for whom the write-off made a bigger difference simply because their taxes were bigger to begin with. But there were additional provisions like the “direct pay” tax credit system that allowed nonprofits and governments to take on costs of clean energy installation at the community level, further bolstering solar for lower- and middle-income families. Direct Pay has not been rolled back by the Trump administration as yet. Some entities, like Mountain BizWorks, a nonprofit lender in western North Carolina, can still take advantage of that to fund new clean energy projects — but they’re watching its status closely.

“It definitely adds a bit of urgency and would encourage folks, if they’ve been thinking about pursuing some of those projects, to act now,” said Eric Burton, BizWorks director of energy and climate lending. Commercial tax credits extend through 2027 rather than 2025, but it’s still a tight timeline.

Midwest

Two years ago, Doris Martin, a retired computer scientist, completely retooled her home on the South Side of Chicago. She ditched her oil furnace, water heater, washer, dryer, and stove in favor of energy-efficient electrical appliances that take advantage of growing wind and solar power, lower air pollution in the home, and reduce the carbon dioxide her personal footprint spews into the air.

These days, it’s not unusual for neighbors to ring her doorbell and ask about the heat pump standing in her backyard. They also want to know about her utility bills, which sometimes dip as low as $12.

“It’s like I always hit the lottery,” Martin said.

Martin’s great uncle built the home in 1957, and she and her daughter moved in about 20 years ago. The house had remained relatively unchanged — it even had the original doors. With help from Elevate, a Chicago-based nonprofit tackling utility affordability issues, Martin was able to transform her home into a model of energy efficiency. But the financial incentives that made her retrofit possible — federal tax credits — are now disappearing under the Republican-backed budget bill.

The loss comes just as Chicago and the Midwest were beginning to emerge as national leaders in implementing the carbon-cutting technologies.

Midwestern homeowners were among the most active users of the now-expiring tax credits. In 2023, Wisconsin ranked sixth nationwide for the use of the home energy-efficiency tax credits available through the IRA. Michigan came in at ninth. States like Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio all appeared in the top 20, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate, warns that the cuts will have far-reaching impacts. Her organization helps retrofit about 50,000 homes a year in the Chicago area, relying on a mix of federal tax credits, utility programs, and philanthropic funding. Without the federal incentives, she expects fewer families will be able to afford the upgrades.

“It’s not only going to result in people having higher utility bills,” said Evans. “It’s also going to reduce the jobs that are created through all of this economic activity.”

While the federal tax credits are disappearing, Alex Amends, communications director at Rewiring America, stressed that other pathways to energy efficiency remain. His team is currently tracking approximately 4,000 active incentives across 29 states and is working on adding information for Ohio and North Carolina.

“Thankfully, thousands of programs at the state, local, and utility levels remain in place,” Amends said. “The opportunity is still here and momentum remains strong. People want the better option.”

Southeast

For years, high upfront costs and tax credit structures made it difficult for all but the wealthiest Americans to install home solar. But the Biden-era IRA opened the door to a new kind of rooftop solar program that helped lower-income households tap into the technology and save on their energy bills. Nonprofits were able to claim tax credits as a direct payment from the government, then pass that money on as savings to homeowners who couldn’t otherwise afford rooftop systems. The financial services nonprofit Capital Good Fund coupled that opportunity with a $156 million Solar for All grant — another IRA provision — to fund a suite of low- or no-cost solar-lease programs in Georgia, known as Georgia Bright.

Those plans are now complicated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Georgia Bright is better off than some IRA-funded programs because its money was already committed last year. The Republican budget megabill only rolls back unobligated funds. “For now, everything is proceeding as normal,” said Alicia Brown, the director of Georgia Bright. “We are still submitting reimbursement requests and those are being honored.” (That is despite reports that the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to terminate Solar for All grants. As of August 5, Georgia Bright’s funding was still legally obligated, Brown said.)

But Georgia Bright promises its clients energy savings of 20 percent to 70 percent that are made possible by the IRA’s clean energy tax credits structure. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will now restrict tax credits from going to what it calls a “foreign entity of concern,” defined as “own[ing] in aggregate 40 percent” of a project. There are ongoing efforts to shift solar panel manufacturing to the U.S., but progress is slow and many components still come from overseas. Organizations like Georgia Bright are still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department on how exactly that threshold will be calculated, Brown said.

“Is it just major components? Are we also talking, like, bolts and screws and encapsulants and small things like that?” she said. “If we claim a tax credit we’re not eligible for — I mean, as a nonprofit it could put us out of business.”

The organization is moving ahead with its programs, including launching a drawing for no-cost solar installations in August, Brown said, while also “considering ways to be nimble.” That could mean reducing the number of households enrolled in Georgia Bright, or finding other ways to make up the savings.

“We’re going to keep focusing on doing the work,” said Brown. “Honestly, that’s the best thing you can do to justify a program — show that it’s doing good work for everyone in every congressional district.”

Great Lakes

Among his many roles, Robert Blake, a tribal citizen of the Red Lake Nation in Minnesota, is the executive director of the nonprofit Native Sun Community Power Development. He also owns Solar Bear, a solar-installation company based in Minneapolis. Solar Bear has built four solar projects in the Red Lake Nation, which Blake said bolstered local green energy capacity and provided job and technical training for community members. He sees this kind of work as central to Red Lake’s energy sovereignty — making power more affordable for tribal members and reducing reliance on the broader grid.

Blake had hoped that Department of Energy loan initiatives — such as the Tribal Energy Finance Program, also called the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program — would help them finance additional projects. The IRA expanded the tribal finance program’s credit subsidies and loan guarantees, allowing for more funding for energy projects in Indian Country. The law increased the credit subsidy to $75 million through September 2028, and increased the program’s loan authority from $2 billion to $20 billion. But the Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates nearly all of these funds.

“For small players like myself, and for tribal communities that are traditionally underserved or [under]invested in, this really makes it just that much more difficult,” Blake said.

The recent cuts were merely the latest setback for a program that has struggled to gain momentum, according to Jen Lerch, a senior advisor of the program until April who has worked in tribal finance for decades. The loan program office is critical to developing energy infrastructure, Lerch said, but there’s a fundamental misunderstanding of tribes and tribal finance. “Tribes are public bodies. They are likened to states in the eyes of the law, and certainly should be in the credit market,” she said. “So to approach tribal infrastructure energy financing as though it is, let’s say, Tesla or Rivian, is a grave error.”

Tribes in other parts of the Great Lakes have also seen direct impacts from the legislation. In northern Michigan, Interlochen Public Radio reported that the budget law rescinded $20 million from the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, an environmental nonprofit, and local conservancies. This was under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Regional Conservation Partnership Program. The groups had already spent $450,000 on work to preserve agricultural land and restore streams and rivers — money they will no longer get reimbursed for from the federal government. While the Republican megabill rescinded IRA funds injected into the program, it actually increased its yearly appropriation overall, and the groups will likely apply again. The tribe is also appealing to get back the originally promised funding. Unless that happens, however, they remain in the red.

The Department of Energy didn’t provide comment for this story.

How to take advantage of energy efficiency incentives while you still can

The clean energy tax credit covers up to 30 percent of costs for installing new clean energy infrastructure in your home — but time is running out. Experts say you can still take advantage of the clean energy tax credit, as well as the energy-efficiency home improvement credit, with pretty much any contractor until December 31, 2025 (compared to a gradual phaseout beginning in 2033, originally set in the Inflation Reduction Act). That means expenses you rack up on clean energy and energy efficiency are still eligible until the end of the year. But it’s best to get to it fast — contractors are getting booked quickly.

The company is also applying to expand its existing lease for the Flat Canyon Federal Coal Lease Tract to “increase the tract acreage by 660 acres, adding approximately 2,095,000 tons of contiguous recoverable coal,” according to the analysis.
Also, the life of the Skyline Mine would be extended for 18 months past its January 2032 estimated retirement date.
“(The executive orders) support the domestic coal industry by enhancing coal production and use as a means of securing economic prosperity and national security, lowering electricity costs, and supporting job creation,” the environmental review says.
Spencer Cox commended the action, saying it would “deliver reliable power, rural jobs, and greater American energy independence.” “Energy abundance means economic strength and national security,” he wrote.","A Utah mine is set to be the first in the nation to take advantage of new federal rules expediting leases for coal production on federal land, passed as part of the congressional Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” last month, the U.S. Department of the Interior said Wednesday.

Canyon Fuel Company, the operator of Carbon County’s Skyline Mine since 1981, is requesting leasing the Little Eccles Federal Coal Lease Tract, comprising up to 120 acres and containing 858,000 to 1,025,000 tons of recoverable coal, according to the environmental impact analysis.

The company is also applying to expand its existing lease for the Flat Canyon Federal Coal Lease Tract to “increase the tract acreage by 660 acres, adding approximately 2,095,000 tons of contiguous recoverable coal,” according to the analysis.

If approved, the developments would produce nearly 3 million tons of recoverable coal on federal land and nearly 4.6 million tons of private coal, in addition to the 40 million tons of coal mined over the last 10 years. Also, the life of the Skyline Mine would be extended for 18 months past its January 2032 estimated retirement date.

“This is a critical step in unleashing the full economic potential of our coal resources and delivering reliable, affordable energy to American families,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess, said in a statement. “President Trump made it clear that we will not tie up American energy in red tape. Under his leadership, we’re cutting delays, boosting production, and putting miners back to work.”

That’s the first coal leasing process accelerated because of the “big, beautiful bill.”

The law required the accelerated processing of pending coal lease applications, giving the Secretary of Interior 90 days to review them, to publish any required environmental review for public comment, establish the fair market value, hold a lease sale and identify the highest bidder for coal tracts. The secretary may also grant additional approvals to previously issued coal leases so mining can start.

The Department of the Interior also highlighted in a news release that the action supported Trump’s executive orders seeking to propel the country’s coal industry.

“(The executive orders) support the domestic coal industry by enhancing coal production and use as a means of securing economic prosperity and national security, lowering electricity costs, and supporting job creation,” the environmental review says. “They further outline a series of policies and actions to remove regulatory barriers, promote coal exports, and assess coal resources on federal lands, while also encouraging the development of coal technologies.”

The Bureau of Land Management will soon open a public comment period to determine the fair value market and the maximum economic recovery of the federal coal in the lease area.

In a social media post, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox commended the action, saying it would “deliver reliable power, rural jobs, and greater American energy independence.”

“Energy abundance means economic strength and national security,” he wrote.

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program.

Mr. Zeldin and Mr. Vought:

We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution.

Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.

In 2024, the State of Oregon received an $86.6 million award from the EPA to develop a statewide Solar for All program. These funds, awarded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are fully obligated. Since January 2025, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) has worked diligently in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon to design a cost-effective program with a focus on efficient procurement and project planning while also building strong partnerships with local community-based organizations across the state.

If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year. Your recent actions have jeopardized these crucial services and stripped thousands of Oregonians of access to this cost-effective program.

If allowed to spend the federal funds it was legally awarded, the State of Oregon has plans to establish a program that would support solar panel installation on multi-family buildings and the development of community solar projects, while also investing in workforce development activities to ensure a robust and efficient solar industry in Oregon. This program would be the only statewide residential solar incentive program and without it, residential solar will not be a cost-effective option for low-income Oregonians. Now that the EPA has terminated federal Solar for All funds, thousands of low-income Oregonians will suffer from higher utility costs and less resilient energy sources.

The Solar for All program is crucial to meeting future energy needs in the Pacific Northwest while lowering household costs for working-class families. In Oregon, customers have suffered from exponentially increasing energy bills, with some utilities raising prices on residential households by 50% since 2020. Nationwide, the Solar for All program is on track to help more than 900,000 people install solar and reduce their electricity bills by at least 20 percent. The Solar for All program is designed to shield middle- and low-income families from these extreme price increases that place additional financial strain on households that are already struggling to pay their bills.

The EPA notified the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) late last night that it is immediately terminating the $62.45 million grant the state secured through the program last year. Reports indicate that other grant recipients have also been informed that their grants are being terminated.

“At a time when households could benefit from transitioning to solar energy now more than ever, the Trump administration is attempting to terminate a program that would lower energy costs for families and businesses while also delivering clean energy,” Governor Lamont said. “These funds belong to the taxpayers of Connecticut. This action by EPA is unlawful, and we will be working with other states to counter this action.”

“Once again, Donald Trump is seizing funds intended to lower costs for American families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Attorney General William Tong said. “These funds were passed by Congress to reduce carbon pollution and to save money for low-income families getting socked right now by utility bills. We are evaluating all legal options in coordination with our multistate partners to protect Connecticut families and Connecticut funds.”

“This action by the Trump EPA cuts off access to clean, affordable solar energy for thousands of Connecticut residents,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “Connecticut’s Solar for All program would help residents, particularly those in multi-family affordable housing, and communities, access the benefits of clean solar energy and the much-needed cost savings it can provide. This program would also help us improve our air quality, which is among the worst in the nation, and make our electric grid more resilient. EPA’s action runs completely counter to our efforts to bring affordable, clean, and reliable energy to Connecticut residents.”

Established by the EPA in early 2024, the Solar for All program was created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and $7 billion was committed toward the program. The funds were to be used to help expand the availability and accessibility of clean and affordable solar energy in homes and communities nationwide, particularly those in low-income and disadvantaged communities. The program was designed to cut energy bills by an estimated 20% annually for participating households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, translating to hundreds of dollars in savings per year for people who could otherwise not access these technologies. Additionally, the program was estimated to create 200,000 jobs nationally and avoid 30 million metric tons of carbon emissions.

Shortly after its creation, DEEP applied for a grant on behalf of the state through an application it submitted in collaboration with the Connecticut Green Bank, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, the Connecticut Department of Housing, and the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development, among others. On April 22, 2024, DEEP was notified by the EPA that it had secured a $62.45 million grant, and the funds were obligated on July 12, 2024.

DEEP’s plans were to use the grant to help thousands of Connecticut households transition their homes to solar energy, with a particular emphasis on prioritizing multi-family affordable housing units.

The $156 million cut is part of a move by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.

The funding, part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients, including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

The cut will pause NCEF’s efforts to provide financing for home, commercial and multi-family housing rooftop solar projects and support workforce development, according to the organization. The program would have helped more than 50,000 Nevadans and created nearly 1,000 new jobs, according to NCEF.

Although NCEF does what CEO Kirsten Stasio described as “braiding multiple sources of funding together to fill gaps in accessing clean energy opportunities for Nevadans,” she said the cut to Solar for All “is a real hit.”

“They’re letting down 50,000 Nevadans,” Stasio told The Nevada Independent.

NCEF had already invested nearly $1 million of the Solar for All funds in a facility utilized by a Northern Nevada nonprofit that provides transitional housing for women.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding,” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American “energy dominance in the global market.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy, and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal.

NCEF says the grant funds are legally obligated to the fund and the termination violates EPA’s own terms and conditions. Earlier this year, a funding freeze was put in place on Solar for All funds that a judge later ordered unfrozen.

Stasio said she expects further legal action with this latest move.

That's because a federal program allowing electric vehicles into the express HOV lane is set to end.

Many experts predict it will cause a shift in traffic patterns.

""Losing this perk is going to hurt a lot of people""

Under New York's Clean Pass Program, drivers of electric vehicles were allowed to travel in the high occupancy vehicle, or HOV, lane on the LIE, even if they were driving alone.

Crews finished building the HOV lane back in 2005. About a year later, the Clean Pass Program was introduced, initially as a pilot. There are now almost 80,000 electric vehicles registered on Long Island, and nearly 50,000 of them are signed up for the program.

The state Department of Transportation recently sent out thousands of notices to participants, saying ""Congress and the president have not reauthorized this program,"" and ""it will end on September 30th.""

Transportation experts predict the change will cause a mess on the highway since it will push those vehicles into regular traffic lanes.

""Losing this perk is going to hurt a lot of people,"" Robert Sinclair of AAA said. ""During rush hours, it will make for more traffic.""

""I am not so happy""

Sustainable transportation advocates call it too abrupt of an ending.

""There is capacity on the HOV lane and at some point, you'll run out and the program would have to end, but you could have changed what vehicles had access to it,"" said Rosemary Mascali, chair of the Drive Electric LI Education and Outreach Committee. ""You could have said, starting in September, hybrids can no longer participate because you don't get as great fuel efficiency.""

""This is worsening the idea and it's going to make the DOT rethink the whole idea of an HOV lane. Maybe they'd like to put it in places with more buses,"" said Marjaneh Issapour of the Renewable Energy & Sustainability Center at Farmingdale State College.

Deer Park resident Peter Vanzandt owns an electric vehicle, and says it cut the time of his daily commute in New York City in half. That might not be the case very much longer.

""Part of the reason why I bought the car was for that perk, so I am not so happy,"" he said.

Supporters of the Clean Pass Program, like the nonprofit Renewable Energy Long Island, are calling for an extension ""for further studies of congestion issues and the benefits for human health and the environment.""

CBS News New York spoke with some drivers who had mixed reactions.

""Returning back to the original use of high occupancy is fine with me,"" Dennis Sullivan said.

""I think it's a sad thing. We want to encourage people to use electric,"" Greenport resident Ann Plyler said.

""Absent successful litigation, this program is dead,"" said Commissioner of Public Service Kerrick Johnson Friday.

Vermont was in the midst of standing up programs to roll out the funding and had already allocated $22 million to the Vermont Housing and Finance Agency to support installing solar at affordable housing developments.

Remaining funds were supposed to help more than 1,000 low income households in the state access free or very low cost solar panels, something state regulators have said would lead to lower electric bills.

The roughly $7 billion Solar For All program was billed by the Biden Administration as an environmental justice initiative. Low-income households nationwide spend the biggest share of their incomes on energy. This is especially true in Vermont, and more so in very rural parts of the state.

When reached for comment, EPA's New England office referred Vermont Public to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin's statement on X earlier this week, where he said, ""The new law eliminates billions of green slush fund dollars by repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a 7 billion dollar program called Solar for All.""

It's not the first time the program has come under attack. Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze, and then re-released, funding for the work as it searched for ways to cut costs from federal programs.

The termination letter says Vermont can expect reimbursement for funds it's already spent and for work to dismantle programs it's already stood up. Johnson says it's too soon to know exactly how much of its award Vermont has already spent.

He says the program's elimination will directly affect at least a few jobs at the Department of Public Service, but the agency is working to find solutions to keep people employed.

""We just got this notice last night, and we're exploring what work, if any, could we continue, using solely state resources,"" Johnson said.

He says the department is also exploring what options may be available to Vermont to pursue these federal funds and keep the program alive.

""We will defer to the legal opinion, in collaboration with the governor's team, of the attorney general's office, and see if we have a claim here,"" he said.

The acquisition includes Northvolt Ett and Ett Expansion (Skelleftea, Sweden), Northvolt Labs (Västeras, Sweden), and Northvolt Drei (Heide, Germany). Additionally, Lyten is acquiring all remaining Northvolt intellectual property (IP).

Lyten has previously announced the acquisition of three other Northvolt assets. In November 2024, Lyten acquired Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California. In early July, Lyten announced the acquisition of Northvolt Dwa, Europe’s largest Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) manufacturing facility, located in Dwa, Poland and expected to close in August. And in late July, Lyten acquired Northvolt’s BESS product and IP portfolio.

Lyten plans to immediately restart operations in Skellefteå (Ett) and Västerås (Labs) upon close of the transaction and collaboration with Northvolt’s prior anchor customers is progressing constructively. Lyten plans to immediately restart Northvolt Dwa upon close of the transaction to support rapidly growing demand for Lyten BESS in more than 20 countries.

At Northvolt Drei, Lyten is working with Northvolt and the German government to continue the program to establish a battery manufacturing facility near Heide in Schleswig-Holstein, with 15 GWh of initial capacity. Lyten is also committed to pursuing the acquisition of Northvolt Six in Quebec, Canada, which is constructing a 15 GWh Phase 1 battery manufacturing facility. Lyten is actively progressing discussions with Northvolt North America, the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec and other key local stakeholders.

Lyten currently manufactures lithium-sulfur batteries in Silicon Valley and is selling commercially into the rapidly growing drone and defense markets. Lyten is also preparing to launch its lithium-sulfur batteries onto the International Space Station in the coming months and has a multi-billion-dollar pipeline for BESS powered by lithium-sulfur.

“This is a defining moment for Lyten,” stated Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and Co-Founder. “Lyten’s mission is to be the leading supplier of clean, locally sourced and manufactured batteries and energy storage systems in both North America and Europe. The acquisition of Northvolt’s assets brings the facilities and Swedish talent to accelerate this mission by years, just at the moment when demand for Lyten lithium-sulfur batteries is growing exponentially to meet energy independence, national security, and AI data center needs.”

Ebba Busch, Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, stated “Lyten’s acquisition of the Northvolt assets is a win for Sweden, for the former employees of Northvolt, and for positioning Sweden as key to Europe’s energy independence. We have been working closely with the Trustee and Lyten to fully support this deal and we are excited to work with Lyten moving forward to make good on the immense potential of these assets.”

Mikael Kubu, Northvolt’s Bankruptcy Trustee: “I am pleased that we have finally found a buyer committed to continuing operations and resuming battery production. During the bankruptcy process, the risk of a complete shutdown was very real, which would have resulted in significant destruction of value. Now, Lyten has the opportunity to carry forward Northvolt’s vision of European energy independence, clean battery production, and job growth in Sweden, Europe, and North America.”",https://electriccarsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lyten-Northvolt.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:09:25.823299

On Monday, regulators plan to give Gov. Gavin Newsom a menu of proposals to expand charging, lower costs and accelerate the transition away from gasoline — a push that could influence clean transportation policy in more than a dozen other states.

After the election last November, state leaders recognized that their plans to phase out fossil fuels from transportation within a few years were imperiled — Donald Trump had pledged to dismantle environmental laws and expressed particular antipathy toward electric cars.

“We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future,” Newsom said at the time. “We’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.” This June, when Congress was finalizing plans to cancel Biden-era EV subsidies of up to $7,500 and other clean-transportation provisions, Newsom ordered state agencies to respond with new policy options.

Planners at the California Air Resources Board have coordinated for the past two months with other state agencies to assemble the list. A spokesperson for the board said the document will be released publicly sometime next week. Meanwhile, academics, environmental advocates and industry representatives have been offering proposals to help decarbonize roadways ahead of the political debate this fall.

At a July 23 hearing in Sacramento, Liane Randolph, the board’s chair, said the state would fight vigorously in court to reverse Trump’s order revoking its authority to regulate air pollution from vehicles. “In the meantime,” she said, “we really need to be thinking about how we can move this market forward. How we can ensure that the technological solutions that are available on the market can continue to scale up.”

Public suggestions include expanding purchase rebates for emissions-free cars and trucks, focusing on making chargers ubiquitous, reducing electricity costs for vehicle charging and subsidizing low-income EV buyers.

The public gatherings presented a rare opportunity to reassess climate strategy in California, which for decades has pushed the auto and oil industries to sell less-polluting cars and fuel. Because 17 states and the District of Columbia follow California’s lead in whole or in part, bold policies could spur automakers to invest in EV production, regardless of climate change skepticism among Republicans in Washington.

While the affordability and performance of EVs improve each model year, they are not yet cost competitive with internal combustion engine cars, so government intervention is still needed to eliminate tailpipe pollution, state officials say.

A series of open meetings across the state last month, and interviews with experts, offer a window on what new ideas could be presented for debate and possible action this fall. Here are four of many solutions highlighted by stakeholders across the state:

1. ‘Feebates’: taxing gas cars, rewarding EVs

Of all the potential policy shifts on the table, few are as untested — or as potentially consequential — as feebates. The basic idea: Tax the sale of new high-emission vehicles and award rebates for cleaner alternatives, especially electric ones. Chris Grundler, deputy executive officer of the Air Resources Board, said he has spoken with feebate proponents about how they might fill the gap left by federal reversals. But he indicated that they would be evaluated in the wider context of EV purchase rebates funded by a variety of possible financial mechanisms.

Leading feebate researcher Daniel Sperling, the founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, said he now favors a stripped-down version: penalize gas cars and trucks and reward EVs, to send the strongest market signal to deprecate the older tech. Other advocates disagree. Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center, also based at UC Davis, said rewarding energy-inefficient electric SUVs over gas hybrids, for example, would send the wrong message. “I don’t think that an EV Hummer is much better than a nice small Prius,” he said. He recommends a neutral formula based on miles per gallon or miles per kilowatt-hour.

Tal and others acknowledge that feebates would face legal and political barriers. California’s Proposition 26 of 2010 requires two-thirds votes in the state Senate and Assembly for any new charge resembling a tax. “I’m skeptical that will pass,” he said. Colleagues are now shifting their focus to the trucking market, which might be easier to navigate politically.

2. Rerouting clean-gasoline credits

California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard — a legal framework implemented in 2011 requiring oil companies either to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of their fuel or subsidize cleaner alternatives — has become one of the state’s largest climate-conservation finance mechanisms, issuing more than $22 billion in credits. But critics say it is now out of step with California’s plan to transition the economy to net-zero emissions by 2045.

Roughly 80% of the program’s credits have gone to producers of biofuels like renewable diesel — meaning oil refiners and other polluters have mostly fulfilled their obligations by subsidizing combustible fuels, rather than supporting zero-emission alternatives like EVs. That division has drawn criticism from environmental groups and economists, who say the program is out of step with the state’s long-term climate goals and fails to promote a true transition away from fossil fuels.

In a June 2025 lawsuit, environmental groups accused the Air Resources Board of failing to evaluate the cumulative health burdens on low-income residents living near agricultural biofuel production facilities. Canary Media writer Jeff St. John argues that California should eliminate the clean-fuel credits and redirect funding to EV rebates and public charging.

But reform won’t be easy: Credits are often embedded in long-term contracts for fuel production among industry actors that are hard to break. Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council still urge reform, warning that without changes, the state could miss the chance to redirect billions toward a speedy transition to electric vehicles.

3. Tapping industry climate revenues

California’s cap-and-trade program — which requires major polluters to buy allowances for the greenhouse gases they emit — brought in $3.4 billion last fiscal year, a steep decline from the previous year. Most of the money is earmarked for other priorities, including high-speed rail, affordable housing and wildfire prevention, making any reallocation a political challenge.

Some environmentalists say the state should set aside a larger share for the EV transition, with a focus on programs like Clean Cars for All, which pays low-income Californians to replace older gas-powered cars with electric models. Mary Creasman, CEO of the advocacy group California Environmental Voters, said that without consistent funding from major sources like cap-and-trade, the state would struggle to meet its mandate that new passenger cars sold be electric within 10 years. She called for a “continuous appropriation for EVs” to help equity-focused rebate programs succeed.

4. Cutting red tape to develop charging infrastructure

Even when funding is in place, slow permitting and utility connections can delay electric vehicle charging projects across the state. Advocates are pushing for reforms that would require utilities to move faster and for cities to expedite approvals, particularly for curbside and apartment complex chargers.

Industry groups and environmental advocates alike say that without fixing these administrative bottlenecks, the state’s planned buildout of fast chargers — and its broader EV adoption goals — will fall short, regardless of how much money lawmakers set aside this year.",https://www.sfpublicpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0683-1170x878.jpeg,N,,2025-08-08 16:10:49.051412

New in Japan in December 2022, this elevated crossover arrived on these shores in 2024.

Subaru really is the quirkiest of brands and that’s become a clever niche for the company to adopt, an astonishing 322,000 cars sold in the USA, its number one market, during the first half of 2025.

As for the UK, we remain a small but worthwhile contributor to the worldwide sales total, adding 1,261 vehicles during the same period. Japan? The tally there was 55,981 cars and SUVs during the same period.

Unusual, in a variety of pleasing ways

You need spend only a few minutes inside the Crosstrek E-Boxer to see the appeal. In lots of ways it’s like a normal car yet feels a bit different. The engine has a characteristic note due to the four opposing cylinders, while there is even a little emblem on the tailgate showing the boxer pattern.

This isn’t anywhere near being the most rapid vehicle in its class, nor is the electrified powertrain necessarily the last word in economy yet Subaru buyers don’t mind. It’s all about having something characterful with the brand’s reputation for unbreakable mechanicals very much intact.

Economy good rather than outstanding

The 1,995 cc engine and 10 kW motor produce a combined 100 kilowatts or 136 PS as well as 182 Nm of torque, this being delivered to both axles via a Lineartronic-branded CVT.

Zero to 62 mph takes 10.8 seconds and the official Combined economy number is 36.8 mpg (I saw 43 mpg) with Combined emissions of 174 g/km. Weight for what is a 4,495 mm long vehicle is 1,597 kilos.

Flip what are 60/40 split rear seats and luggage volume becomes 922 litres but with the backrests in place it’s only 315. Still, the 2,670 mm long wheelbase and 1,600 mm height (includes roof rails) means there is a fairly good space for each of up to five occupants.

Thanks to long-travel suspension there is 220 mm of ground clearance – better than that of many so-called SUVs – so off-roading is possible as the chunky bumpers and black wheel arch guards suggest.

Serenity as standard

The driver is well taken care of with, naturally, every mandated safety system yet joyously, none is over-intrusive. And, only if you fail to select Park before switching the car off, is there any shrill-like beeping from the Crosstrek. If only so very many other cars were just like this.

Facing the person at the wheel is a pair of big, round dials with real needles, the left one automatically dropping to zero engine revolutions as drive-by-motor-only happens. Give the throttle pedal a little push and you can just about hear the engine restarting though it’s very quiet. Press harder and the CVT spins away, revs rise and the naturally aspirated H4 emits a lovely sound.

I had thought body roll might be a prominent feature of the dynamics package but despite the high-rise stance this is not excessive. In fact, the Crosstrek is quite a fun thing, passengers will notice the comfort and the driver has much to entertain them by way of nicely communicative steering.

Sum up

This is the typical Subaru experience. The cars are relatively rare and every time I drive one, it’s the same feeling of wonder that they are not more prevalent on UK roads. But, as the saying goes: if you know; you know.

In summary, the Crosstrek E-Hybrid is a highly competent and unconventional choice and as a warm up to the many more electrified and electric models to come, it’s the perfect bridging model.

Future models

So what else is on the way? A fair bit of activity as it happens. The Solterra, which is a JV with Toyota, will arrive in revised form early in 2026, a facelift having debuted at the New York auto show in April. Around the same time comes the Uncharted, another TMC-JV electric SUV.

Next summer we’ll see the E-Outback, which is a special name for European markets and the same vehicle as North America’s Trailseeker. Will the next Outback also be headed to the UK? The importer is yet to confirm that so it might not be with us until perhaps late 2026 or into 2027. All in all then, quite a busy time for the brand and a lot of potential new business in the British market.",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2025/08/Small-3088-sub340078.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:12:20.575975

Solar for All, a Biden-era initiative, awarded $7 billion in grants nationally to 60 recipients including states, tribes, and regions. The funds contributed to solar projects like rooftop solar and community solar gardens for more than 900,000 lower-income households.

It’s part of the Trump administration’s push away from cleaner energy, following additional cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Democratic Reps. Don Davis (NC-01), Deborah Ross (NC-02), Valerie Foushee (NC-04), and Alma Adams (NC-12) wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin asking him to reconsider and ultimately reverse the termination.

“At a time when energy costs and demand are both rapidly increasing, it is concerning that your agency is considering an action that may violate federal law — Congress has already appropriated the funding — and would increase household energy costs for millions of Americans while jeopardizing thousands of jobs across a wide cross section of states,” the members wrote.

The four representatives also wrote that the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality and its coalition partners — the NC Clean Energy Fund, the NC Clean Energy Technology Center, and Advanced Energy — have an award agreement with the EPA to assist with designing and implementing the state’s Solar for All program.

Zeldin posted a video online denouncing the program and saying the cuts would benefit American taxpayers.

“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” he said.

A federal judge ruled in April that the EPA cannot freeze contracts awarded to nonprofits under the Biden administration, States Newsroom previously reported.

That decision could set an example for potential lawsuits due to stare decisis — the legal principle of following precedent in court.

Michelle “Meech” Carter, clean energy campaigns director at the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said the program supported at least 12,000 North Carolina households through solar installations and enabled upgrades like repairs and replacements.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, some individuals and households in western North Carolina were without power for days, weeks, and even months.

“Folks in the west desperately need to be more independent with their energy sources,” Carter said. “Installing solar on our most vulnerable homes is what’s going to help us achieve energy independence and support our communities that were affected by disasters.”

Carter described the termination as a “consistent removal of any backstops” for people trying to lower their energy bills or protect themselves from disasters.

David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the program created jobs and lowered residential power bills for families.

Trump’s “big beautiful bill” ended tax credits for solar panels and electric vehicles. And the EPA is moving to cancel $7 billion dollars in federal grants that were intended to help low- and middle-income families install solar on their homes.

But that isn’t the whole story. Texas, California, and other states are bringing so much solar and battery power online that in March, fossil fuels generated less than half the electricity in the US for the first time ever. And internationally, solar has gotten so cheap to build and install that it’s fundamentally transforming many countries’ power grids.

So where exactly does solar adoption stand in the US and across the world right now?

“The use of biogenic CO₂ from thermal waste treatment plants and pulp mills appears to be the option with the fewest drawbacks in the short and medium term, with significant untapped potential,” the report says.

European policymakers are pushing for greater deployment of synthetic fuels in aviation, shipping and industry to meet climate targets. Synthetic fuels, also referred to as Power-to-X products, require both green hydrogen made with renewable electricity and a carbon source. Sustainable and scalable CO₂ feedstocks are a key bottleneck for the sector.

The report, carried out by environmental research institute ifeu, warns against expanding ethanol production and biomass power for CO₂ supply, as these processes often depend on monocultures that can cause deforestation, biodiversity loss and soil degradation. Using existing waste and residue streams avoids these drawbacks while still delivering suitable quantities for industrial fuel synthesis, the authors say.

Capturing CO₂ directly from the atmosphere remains costly and technically immature, making waste-derived CO₂ a more practical short-term option, the report notes. However, it warns that using biogenic CO₂ for fuel synthesis could compete with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) projects aimed at achieving negative emissions, which are essential in climate-neutrality scenarios.

The report adds that a global expansion of thermal waste treatment could reduce the environmental impacts of the waste sector. “In particular, it would be advantageous if organic waste no longer released methane in simple landfills,” it says.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-08-08 17:02:51.567256

It is a promising start for Texas and a necessary upgrade to integrate projects like the HyperGrid.","The Texas power grid, long isolated from the rest of the country’s interconnections to avoid federal oversight, has its share of long and near-term problems, such as a projected 8.3% shortfall by 2027 as demand increases, and limited weatherproofing.

Though the Texas legislature and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the independent state grid operator, have taken important steps to more consistently inspect plants and transmission stations as well as plan for increased demand, challenges remain. For instance, severe storms this past May led to widespread outages. Resolving these issues is not easy. The path forward is slow and expensive, with no easy solutions or shortcuts in the offing. This web of problems is why Texas-based Fermi America’s announcement of its HyperGrid project this past June led to an outburst of optimism.

So is the Texas HyperGrid hope or hype? The answer is nuanced; the HyperGrid project has very significant potential, but it is not likely to become a substitute for the need to upgrade and modernize the grid overall – not in Texas, or in the other 49 states.

What Is the HyperGrid?

If successful, the HyperGrid aims to provide 11 GW of power from the “world’s largest data energy complex with nuclear, gas, solar” to help meet projected demand driven by the state’s rapid construction of data centers used to power AI and other critical technologies. The HyperGrid aims to combine nuclear, natural gas, solar, grid-scale batteries, and conventional utility grid power at its Amarillo campus to engage with the frontiers of energy development and both supply and leverage AI.

During his remarks at the launch announcement of the HyperGrid, Fermi America co-founder, former Texas Governor and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry cited the emerging technological race between the United States and China as motivating the project.

The HyperGrid is a direct attempt to meet rising demand by combining new nuclear and gas capacity with renewables on one campus to power data centers. The hope is that by creating a mostly autonomous area of self-sufficient energy consumption and utilization, a model for the Texan grid reform can be propagated. Rather than attempt to upgrade the grid as a whole, a “distributed generation grid model” of upgraded generation and new consumption can be layered on top of the existing grid.

This has several immediate advantages. Notably, it allows for innovation, experimentation, and leading by example. Companies ancillary to energy utilities tend to like this model since it simplifies their corporate responsibilities and adds new capacity quickly. It is a model of delivery that easily allows additional decentralized forms of energy generation to be employed en masse, such as residential solar panels and other home-scale renewables.

HyperGrid Roadblocks

Yet, HyperGrid and the distributed generation grid model have serious challenges. On the whole, it is less efficient in the long term to employ at scale for an entire region, even if it is helpful for quickly adding capacity for specific projects. Furthermore, it can create problems with grid compatibility, uneven capacity, and desynchronization that ERCOT already struggles with.

In response to Forbes’ inquiry, a Fermi America spokesperson said in an email:

Each new AI facility demands 500 megawatts or more. To put that in perspective, it’s like dropping a small city onto the grid overnight. Now multiply that by hundreds of planned facilities. The assumption that our existing infrastructure that is currently experiencing brownouts, could handle this surge wasn’t just optimistic—it was the oceanfront property in Arizona that George Strait warned us about.

Recognizing this challenge months ago, Fermi America chose to build a private grid, giving Texas the energy it needs to continue its growth and innovation trajectory, without taking power away from our local communities.

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the current U.S. transmission system is likely to need to double or more in size by 2050. However, the country is headed in the wrong direction. A report from Americans for a Clean Energy Grid found that the rate at which new transmission lines are being added has slowed dramatically over the past decade, despite increases in transmission funding during the same period. With much of the budget allocated to reliability upgrades and the replacement of aging hardware, money is being invested in keeping old lines operational. At the same time, next-generation smart grid technology that is needed to address intermittency is often overlooked.

Independent utilities, such as ERCOT, have acknowledged this issue and proposed a plan to upgrade a substantial portion of the state’s transmission lines. It is a promising start for Texas and a necessary upgrade to integrate projects like the HyperGrid. The paradox is that the likely localized success of HyperGrid may dissuade utilities from necessary grid upgrades at scale, with U.S. utilities paying more at the end of the day or being unable to handle the load challenge that is coming up fast, ending up paying the pound a cure, rather than a penny of prevention.

American Grid Reform

ERCOT’s efforts will set a nationwide precedent. After years of reform, ERCOT has drastically improved and is now one of the best-ranked utilities in the country. This means, thankfully, the paradox and challenges the HyperGrid creates are occurring in an area that is well-suited to test the project’s approach.

Coordinating between multiple levels of authority and navigating different jurisdictions will come with its challenges as well. According to the Niskanen Center and Clean Air Task Force, federal entities like the Department of Energy and the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council are not taking the lead in upgrading transmission infrastructure at sufficient speed, nor are they prioritizing transmission agendas or providing adequate support to inter-agency cooperation.

Another major issue at present is the growing number of projects looking to connect to the grid that are stuck in interconnection queues, the testing and study phase before grid connection. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found last year that nearly 269.2 GW of combined production and storage capacity looking to connect to ERCOT is held up in these queues.

One thing Secretary Perry is right about: Washington cannot take its eyes off the prize. The growing competition with the People’s Republic of China in the energy sphere is a race that America needs to win. China unveiled a new national energy law at the beginning of 2025 to coordinate its many energy-centric efforts. Beijing has fully committed to revitalizing its nuclear industry to meet increasing energy demands in conventional areas as well as the rapidly growing AI sector. China is already a world leader in renewable technology production and clean energy, and the U.S. has ground to make up if it wants to keep up with China. That requires a modern grid.

To advance grid infrastructure and compete globally, the Department of Energy published the Distributed Energy Resource Interconnection Roadmap this January, a plan to bring together smaller grids, modernize hardware, and improve access. The Trump Administration has issued executive orders aimed at promoting the development of American AI and plans to issue additional orders to streamline the grid connection process and provide federal land for new data centers. In concert, these moves can help bring together a national strategy for the electrical grid, but practical and efficient actions to follow through will be key to success.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6896128ce16bcfbed2847366/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-08 16:13:47.734052

I was busy trying to survive to even think about an electric car then. But I heard about it from a Chinese woman at a writer’s workshop in Michigan about 15 years ago. She’d only been in the country for about 5 years and she was mortified that our own government would be involved in anything like this.

Who Killed the Electric Car shows how an innovation aimed at eliminating the need for gasoline to fuel cars in the 1990s was squelched by the automotive industry. General Motors unveiled its EV-1 in 1997 as a car that provides transportation without using any gas or oil. It also needed no muffler and never required a brake change.

Although the idea seemed to solve most of the issues and costs associated with maintaining a car’s engine, GM recalled and destroyed every type of EV-1 in 2003. The documentary explains how a combination of factors led to the demise of the revolutionary car. Those factors include actions taken by other automobile manufacturers, governments, and consumers. In the future, though, the technology that utilises renewable resources to power vehicles could ultimately prevail. But as society has learned from the past, the future of the electric car depends on outside influences.

20 years later, I am happy to say that I now drive an electric car. A Subaru Solterra — good in the winters, good in the mountains, good on the pocket book. It’s def not a luxury car, but it is solid and smart. We live in the Rockies with major winter snow, and Subarus abound. We were able to lease it for $316 a month for 3 years with a $20k payoff and just a few K down.

(Ironically, it is actually our 3rd EV. In 2021 we traded in both our paid off older Subarus to get a Toyota Prime Hybrid. We loved it. Two years later it was totaled as I was nailed between a hit-and-run highway drunk and the car behind which struck me at 60mph. I was uninjured, but the car was not. We leased our first Solterra EV in 2023 while we waited for insurance to figure it out.

The 23 Solterra was a little slower than most EVs in charging, so they improved that on the 2024 model. Then with all the crazy Tesla stuff, Subaru dropped the prices on Solterras about $10k in 2025. All the EV rebates ($11.5K in Colorado) were taken off the sticker price at the dealer.

When I saw that the federal rebates were going to disappear as of SEPTEMBER 30, 2025 I decided it was time to trade up in order to get the improved model. The new one is less than the old one, with a 50% lower payoff! Yes, I’ll have payments for an extra 14 months — but that won’t even break $5k.)

We’re the first in our family to own an electric car. We haven’t bought gas in years. Even with the Toyota Prime, we bought gas once every two months — and we live in the mountains. (Lotta folks up here have gone electric.) We’ve yet to see a downside, except for the need to plan ahead when traveling distances.

Why this diary?

He’s gonna try to kill electric car! Again.

I have no idea what will happen to all those cars sitting at dealerships. But I’d bet money it’s not going to hurt the fossil fuel industry. I’d bet money it will hurt the earth and set us back.

What happens when the rebates for EV cars expire

The expiration of the federal tax credits for electric vehicles will lead to several changes for buyers and sellers alike. Here are the key points to consider:

Loss of Tax Credits: Buyers will no longer receive the federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, which could significantly increase the effective cost of these vehicles.

Potential for Higher Prices: With the loss of tax credits, manufacturers may adjust their pricing strategies, potentially leading to higher prices for electric vehicles.

State-Level Incentives: Many states will continue to offer their own electric vehicle incentives beyond 2025, but these may not be equal to the current rebates.

Limited Inventory: As the deadline approaches, there may be limited inventory and choices for popular EV models due to the expected increase in purchases leading up to the September deadline.

State Electric Vehicle Tax Credits: Some states may still offer electric vehicle tax credits and rebates, which could provide additional financial incentives for buyers.

It is advisable for potential buyers to act quickly and check with their dealers or manufacturers to ensure they can benefit from the federal tax credits before they expire. Additionally, consulting with a tax professional can provide guidance on the best options for purchasing an electric vehicle.

L. No. 119-21 into law. Consistent with past law, certain provisions in the legislation require a taxpayer to establish the beginning of construction (BOC) to qualify for tax credits and deductions.1 For example, under the OBBBA, wind and solar facilities that begin construction after 4 July 2026 and are placed in service after 31 December 2027 cannot receive the Section 45Y or Section 48E credit; for the Section 45V credit, construction must begin by 31 December 2027. Rules requiring application of a material assistance cost ratio (MACR) generally apply to those facilities beginning construction after 31 December 2025. Eligibility for the new full expensing deduction for manufacturing facilities requires construction to begin after 19 June 2025.

Taxpayers have long relied on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notices to establish BOC. However, changes made by the OBBBA to the statutory framework and an executive order issued closely following enactment have thrown this standard into flux. This alert discusses those changes and how potential guidance from the US Department of the Treasury (Treasury) may impact long-standing BOC principles.

Legislative References to BOC Guidance

During congressional consideration of the energy provisions of the OBBBA, competing timelines were put forward regarding the termination of the clean energy provisions. Certain members sought to impose a fixed “placed-in-service” date. Others, together with many industry stakeholders, argued a BOC date was more appropriate, allowing projects already underway to be completed without having to meet an accelerated placed-in-service timeline.

The enacted version of the OBBBA generally relies on BOC rather than placed-in-service dates. Under the MACR rules, the legislation provides that BOC will be determined in accordance with “rules similar to the rules under Internal Revenue Service Notice 2013-29 and Internal Revenue Service Notice 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.”2 These references were, as Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) put it, “intended to grant the wind and solar industries a yearlong transition to confidently move forward with planned projects under the existing continuity safe harbor and the beginning of construction guidance in effect at the time of the law’s enactment.”3 For non-MACR purposes, however, the OBBBA does not reference the BOC rules. While stakeholders assumed that the IRS notices would continue to be the benchmark for determining whether construction had begun, the executive order issued by President Trump on 7 July 2025 has thrown that confidence into doubt.

Long-Standing IRS Principles

Under Notice 2013-29, the IRS established two tests under which a taxpayer might establish that it had begun the construction necessary to qualify for either the production tax credit under Section 45 or the energy investment tax credit under Section 48. The first test requires starting physical work of a “significant nature.” To satisfy this test, which focuses on the nature of the work rather than its cost, the physical work can be completed on- or off-site by the taxpayer (or by a contracted third party). Preliminary work—planning or designing, securing financing, obtaining permits, and the like—does not count. The second test established under Notice 2013-29, the safe harbor test, provides that construction commences when the taxpayer incurs 5% or more of the total cost of the facility. Any cost includable in the depreciable basis of the facility counts toward the 5% threshold, but the cost of the land or any property not integral to the facility does not.

A taxpayer must only satisfy either the physical work or safe harbor test under Notice 2013-29 to establish BOC. Once the BOC date is established, the taxpayer must “maintain a continuous program of construction” on the project. To ease the administrative burden of tracking these activities, the IRS issued a clarification to Notice 2013-29 offering a safe harbor, which presumes a project satisfies the continuity requirement if it is placed in service within a certain number of years after construction begins, generally four years.4

The IRS subsequently issued Notice 2018-59 in response to changes to Section 48, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018,5 specifically a shift from placing a qualifying facility in service to a BOC standard as the threshold to determine eligibility. Notice 2018-59 closely follows the guidelines set out by its predecessor Notice 2013-29, including the physical work and 5% safe harbor tests.

President Trump Weighs In

Despite the IRS notices, an executive order issued by President Trump three days after signing the OBBBA into law has cast considerable uncertainty into the criteria necessary to establish BOC for non-MACR purposes. The executive order directs the Treasury Secretary to, within 45 days from 4 July 2025:

take all action as [he] deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance . . . to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.6

The executive order may be the product of a deal President Trump struck with fiscal conservatives who thought the final version of the bill was not restrictive enough on clean energy. For instance, members of the House Freedom Caucus met with President Trump before voting to pass the bill. Following that meeting, Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) reported that “the Murkowski language that got put in there that would put that ‘in construction’ language—the year—that we thought was not particularly helpful or good policy to achieve what we and the president want to achieve. I think there’s going to be some things there that they’re going to be able to do.” Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) echoed this conclusion, saying, “We wanted date of service, which means they can’t take a backhoe out there and dig a ditch and say that’s construction. So things like that the president is going to enforce.”

The 45-day period set forth in the executive order expires on 18 August2025. It remains unclear to what extent Treasury will alter the existing BOC guidance and under what format Treasury will choose to do so. Market participants, however, should recognize that any of the standards in those notices, including the 5% safe harbor, the significant construction, and the continuity of construction, could be revised. Changes could include, for instance, increasing the safe harbor percentage rate, imposing stricter standards on site work, and modifying the continuous construction safe harbor. It is also unclear whether any revisions to the BOC rules will be limited to clean energy tax credits. Guidance could take the form of another IRS notice, FAQs, or other means. Whatever the changes, they are expected to make it more difficult to meet the BOC threshold on which many the OBBBA provisions rely.

Given the brief period provided under the OBBBA to establish BOC and qualify for the relevant tax incentives, taxpayers will need to quickly assess the impact of the guidance on their projects.

“Clean Air Vehicle Decals are a smart, cost-effective incentive that has played an important role driving the adoption of clean and zero-emission vehicles in California,” read a statement from Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board.
In 2023, California had nearly 1.3 million light-duty electric vehicle registrations and was the only state to report such a high number.
Without the program, drivers will lose access to the carpool lane, but Magavern said it should also mean less congestion in the HOV lanes.
But even though the carpool decal program was once helpful in getting Californians to purchase electric vehicles, Magavern argued that times have changed.","For the last two decades, more than a million motorists who have slapped “clean air vehicle” decals on their electric and hybrid cars have been free to cruise in carpool lanes with no passengers.

But that perk could be coming to an end Sept. 30 if Congress fails to extend California’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program.

For the record:

Correction: An earlier version of this article stated the decal stickers would become invalid Oct. 2. They will no longer be valid Oct. 1.

“Clean Air Vehicle Decals are a smart, cost-effective incentive that has played an important role driving the adoption of clean and zero-emission vehicles in California,” read a statement from Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board. “But thanks to the federal government’s failure to act, this successful program is coming to an end.”

You can still apply for a decal by Aug. 29, but it will become invalid Oct. 1, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles.

Extending the decal program in California — or any other state — would require the approval of Congress and the signature of President Trump, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air.

“I certainly would not bet on that,” Magavern said.

“It seems that the only deadline that this Congress responds to are the deadlines that are set by Trump, and I really don’t see him going out of his way to extend this program.”

Why this state program needs congressional approval

Federal legislation has allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to grant solo drivers in low-emission and energy-efficient cars to use the carpool, or High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV), lane.

The goal was to promote the adoption of alternative-fuel vehicles and assist in meeting environmental goals that included reducing fuel consumption and pollution caused by congested freeways, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Over time, states developed incentive programs, choosing which car models to give carpool access to.

“Clearly in the early days of zero-emission cars, the carpool lane stickers were an important incentive for some drivers, particularly in places like the Bay Area and Los Angeles where there is major congestion,” Magavern said.

California is one of 13 states that offer this type of incentive program to its residents. Qualified drivers in the Golden State include those who drive fuel cell electric, natural gas or plug-in electric cars.

Whether the program is still a major incentive, “with electric vehicles topping 20% of new sales, I think is open to question,” Magavern said.

However, the electric car advocacy group Plug In America said the program has always been a factor in the minds of consumers.

“Just like a lot of other incentives, the HOV lane access through the Clean Air Vehicle Program is one of those things that drivers look to to assess the overall package of what it’s like to either go electric or to get that next electric vehicle,” said Alexia Martineau, senior policy manager for Plug in America.

Not renewing the program means that those drivers just have one less reason in the positive column for going electric, Martineau said.

In 2023, California had nearly 1.3 million light-duty electric vehicle registrations and was the only state to report such a high number. Behind California was Florida, with roughly 255,000 registrations, and Texas, with roughly 230,000, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. (Neither Florida nor Texas offers an incentive program.)

In 2015, Congress authorized California’s program through a highway funding bill, but that authorization is expiring as of Sept. 30.

What’s being done to extend the life of clean air vehicle decals

In an effort to extend the decal program, state Assemblymember Greg Wallis (R-Bermuda Dunes) authored Assembly Bill 2678, which would push the end date to Jan. 1, 2027.

The bill was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year but is lacking federal approval. Without federal approval, the bill becomes moot.

“Putting the brakes on this program means that starting October 1, 2025, CAV decals will no longer be valid in California, or elsewhere in the United States,” the Department of Motor Vehicles said in a statement. “All vehicles will be required to meet posted vehicle occupancy to travel in carpool lanes and pay required tolls or risk receiving a citation.”

According to the California Air Resources Board, there are currently 519,000 active decals in the state, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

What could this mean for the state’s environmental goals?

Without the program, drivers will lose access to the carpool lane, but Magavern said it should also mean less congestion in the HOV lanes.

“Now that California has hundreds of thousands of zero-emission vehicles, they can take up a lot of space in the HOV lanes, and those were meant to incentivize people to carpool,” he said.

In addition to drivers losing access to carpool lanes, the change could slow the progress the state has made in getting more people into alternative fuel vehicles and reducing pollution.

California’s goal for 2035 is that all new passenger vehicles sold in the state be zero-emission.

Car technology today, such as battery-electric, plug-in hybrid-electric and fuel cell electric vehicles, is helping the state reach its goal, according to the California Air Resources Board.

In fact, sales on electric vehicles have been on the rise in the state since 2011, with the exception of stagnant sales between 2018 and 2020, according to a report published by UC Davis.

Today, one in four new cars sold in the state is an EV, Dahlia Garas, of the university’s Electric Vehicle Research Center, said in the report.

The university’s Electric Vehicle Research Center conducted a survey of drivers from the start of the year until June and found that almost 30% of people said that without any state incentives, including the decal, they wouldn’t have chosen to purchase an electric vehicle, said Scott Hardman, assistant director of the center.

“We’re still at a very fragile point in the transition to all vehicles being electric,” Hardman said. “Only 8% of the vehicles on the road are electric, and that’s not enough for you to reach the point where the vehicles are a social norm.”

The Clean Air Vehicle Decal program is just one way the state is working toward its environmental goals — milestones that have recently come under attack, including California’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards.

Recently, U.S. House representatives voted to prohibit California from banning the sale of new gasoline-only cars by 2035 and end California’s ability to set emissions standards for heavy-duty trucks and to combat smog levels in the state.

In Magavern’s view, those actions are part of the Trump administration’s “war” on California’s air, water and climate.

But even though the carpool decal program was once helpful in getting Californians to purchase electric vehicles, Magavern argued that times have changed.

“I think that you can make a good argument that they’ve outlived their time and that it’s more important to have the carpool lanes be filled by vehicles that actually have carpools in them,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5e83f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+122/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F03%2F1f6d7ea641e0a2bb20bde054c21f%2Fhov-sticker-photo-by-rob.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:10:56.478596

we identified 13 zombie programs—including ethanol subsidies—that refused to die.","In the waning days of summer, with Congress out of town on their August “recess,” we’ve been busy warning the federal government that mandating record levels of U.S. biofuels consumption during a time of already high consumer prices will only further increase our backyard BBQ costs—real food and fuel prices for all Americans. In public comment to the Environmental Protection Agency, we spotlighted ballooning taxpayer costs from forcing more ethanol, biodiesel, and other biofuels into U.S. transportation fuel through the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandate.

Forcing refiners to blend a set amount of biofuels each year is bad business. When the government decides to pick winners, taxpayers end up losing. Since its creation in 2007, the RFS has led to higher costs and a biofuels industry increasingly reliant on taxpayer-backed subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) only added fuel to the fire—and we’re not talking about the kind you use to roast marshmallows.

When EPA released its proposed RFS biofuel mandates for 2026 and 2027 back in June, Congress had not yet passed the FY2025 reconciliation bill, aka OBBBA. Little did taxpayers know, OBBBA would protect biofuels—and a couple other of the usual special interest winners—while cutting most renewable energy subsidies enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. In true zombie fashion, OBBBA didn’t just resurrect biofuel tax breaks, it supercharged them. (We predicted this would happen. Alas, no silver bullets.)

Created in the IRA, the $8.4 billion 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit was sold as a way to support low-carbon transportation fuels, but it had little detail on which fuels it would support. We warned it could do the opposite by subsidizing high-carbon corn ethanol and soy biodiesel—the very fuels lawmakers voted to stop subsidizing in 2011 and 2022.

OBBBA eliminated that uncertainty. It extended the 45Z tax credit and greatly expanded eligibility. Specifically, Congress prohibited the Treasury Department from accounting for the environmental impact—and associated emissions—of more land being farmed for biofuels production. See, when an acre of corn that previously fed humans or animals is now used to feed cars, the previous demand doesn’t disappear. Instead, other farmers grow the corn the market still demands, often by converting pasture or native, unplowed grassland into crop land. Accounting for increased emissions from this “indirect land-use change” provides a more accurate calculation of the carbon intensity of “clean fuels.” But now, Treasury is prohibited from doing so.

Everyone from the ethanol industry to conservative think tanks agrees these emissions are real. Pretending they don’t exist is a fiscal nightmare, opening the door to more 45Z tax credit claims. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that (1) ignoring the emissions from land conversion, and (2) extending the so-called “clean fuel” 45Z credit for two more years, will cost taxpayers an additional $25.7 billion over the next decade.

Congress cut a lot of programs in OBBBA—nutrition assistance, Medicaid—but biofuels were not only spared, they were put on a corn-fed diet. 45Z offers a sliding scale tax credit of $0.20 to $1.75 per gallon depending on how carbon intensive a fuel is. By eliminating indirect land-use change emissions from the calculation, companies can consume two to three times higher per-gallon subsidies—or more, if the industry succeeds in convincing the government that “climate-smart” farming practices deserve even more subsidies, whether or not there is evidence they actually improve the climate.

Problem is, the U.S. already requires fuel blenders to mix more than 20 billion gallons of biofuels into gasoline and diesel each year under the RFS. The mandate was supposed to increase energy security and promote “advanced” biofuels made from wood waste, corn cobs, and perennial grasses—not food crops like corn and soybeans.

Those industries never came to life, even with heavy subsidies. Still, the RFS at least acknowledged the environmental cost of converting grasslands and forests into farmland. Wishing away those emissions doesn’t make them disappear—it just leads to more taxpayer handouts for corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. And the irony is that the U.S. would produce ethanol regardless. Ethanol serves as an oxygenate in fuel, replacing MTBE, a toxic additive banned in 2005.

In 2011, nearly three-fourths of the Senate—Republicans and Democrats—agreed that both mandating and subsidizing ethanol was fiscally indefensible. That year, Congress ended the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC), which had been on the books since 1978. The ethanol industry survived just fine without subsidies for 13.5 years. Re-subsidizing it now is unlikely to increase production, create jobs, or grow the economy. But it will cost taxpayers tens of billions through 2029.

Taxpayers have industry lobbyists to thank.

In 2015, biofuel lobbyists convinced then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to revive another subsidy—this time for ethanol blender pumps—even after Congress voted to end it in 2014. Vilsack earned a Golden Fleece award from us that year for using $100 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation to defy the will of Congress.

This isn’t new.

In our 1995 “Budget of the Living Dead” report (we’re celebrating our 30th anniversary this year!) we identified 13 zombie programs—including ethanol subsidies—that refused to die. The report fittingly quotes the late Rep. George Brown (D-CA):

“The first thing you learn around here is that nothing ever dies.”

If Congress and the Administration are serious about eliminating waste, lowering food and fuel prices, and reducing the national debt, they should start by killing off zombie biofuel subsidies—before they shuffle out of the woods again at next summer’s Camp Taxpayer.",https://www.taxpayer.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/tim-mossholder-rVXAUFywlWQ-unsplash-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:12:40.785085

Over the past few years, U.S. steel production hovered close to total U.S. steel consumption, boasting a low net import reliance of 13 percent in 2023.","Citing threats to national security, the Trump administration in February issued a 25% tariff on steel to curb excessive imports ultimately caused by Chinese overproduction. Following the tariff, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act granted a 2.5% production tax credit for metallurgical coal—an input in the steelmaking process. The Department of Energy justified federal support for metallurgical coal based on the anticipation of increased demand driven by reinvigorated domestic steel output. But, because the U.S. is a net-exporter of metallurgical coal, the Trump administration’s tax credit effectively subsidizes foreign steel producers, like China, who purchases a sixth of U.S. metallurgical coal exports, without giving any significant benefit to U.S. supply chains.

The steel tariffs and metallurgical coal tax credit come alongside other tariffs on copper, aluminum, and graphite, targeting what the Trump administration sees as strategic materials at risk of Chinese dumping practices. At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act phased out the 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit for critical minerals. Phasing out the tax credits for critical minerals only weakened the U.S.’s ability to secure its most vulnerable mineral supply chains, many of which are dominated by China.

These actions collectively indicate an increasingly confused approach by the Trump administration to address the risks that China poses to U.S. supply chains. Abandoning critical mineral tax credits pushes the U.S. further from a coordinated strategy informed by risk factors like single points of failure or net import reliance which the the Department of the Interior assesses when designating critical minerals. The shotgun approach employed by the Trump administration only risks wasting limited federal resources on an arbitrary list of pet commodities that are often non-issues. The taxpayer-funded metallurgical coal blunder serves as a prime example. Production tax credits for critical minerals would do more to secure the U.S. against disruptive Chinese trade practices than for metallurgical coal which the U.S. could easily support in more cost effective ways.

What is metallurgical coal?

Metallurgical coal is an ingredient in steel and other metal alloys, (though the tax credit only specifies steel production). It should not be confused with thermal coal, which power plants burn to generate electricity. Some metallurgical coals possess properties suitable for the production of coke, which blast furnaces use to make pig iron, a feedstock for steelmaking. This technique comprised 28% of U.S. steel production in 2024. The remaining 72% of steel production came from electric arc furnaces which use anthracite coal to help control the carbon content of steel.

The U.S. produced roughly 66 million tons of coking coal across 163 different mines in 2023, exporting around 75% to foreign markets. This output makes the U.S. the second largest exporter of coking coal in the world, accounting for 14% of the global export market. In fact, the U.S. has maintained a net exporter status of coking coal every year since 1980. The share of production that U.S. companies export has steadily increased over the last few decades likely due to decreased use of blast furnaces in U.S. steel production.

Meanwhile, the U.S. produced roughly 3 million tons of anthracite across 41 mines in 2023, exporting roughly 25%. The U.S. has maintained a net exporter status of anthracite for all but 7 years since 1980 despite steady adoption of electric arc furnaces in the U.S. steel fleet. This output ranks the U.S. as the 8th largest anthracite exporter in the world, accounting for 2% of global exports. The robust portfolio of both types of metallurgical coal suggests that the U.S. is hardly import-reliant or vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.

Should the U.S. subsidize metallurgical coal?

The Trump administration’s goal for the metallurgical coal tax credit is to meet the additional amounts of metallurgical coal demanded by the steel sector when it increases production to achieve a capacity utilization rate of 80%, which steel facilities see as necessary to remain economically competitive. However, the U.S. has maintained a net exporter status of metallurgical coal despite the U.S. steel fleet often surpassing 80% capacity utilization over the last decade.

The Department of Energy posed an additional optimal scenario where the U.S. achieves an 85% capacity utilization rate by producing an additional 20 million tons of steel each year. This would annually require roughly an additional 5 million tons of coal for coke used in blast furnaces, an 8% increase from 2023, and 200,000 tons of anthracite used in electric arc furnaces, a 7% increase. Even under this more aggressive scenario, the additional demand would still leave the U.S. as a net exporter of both types of metallurgical coal.

And while capacity utilization rates are not a metric of import reliance, for the United States to achieve self-sufficiency in steel production would require less metallurgical coal. Over the past few years, U.S. steel production hovered close to total U.S. steel consumption, boasting a low net import reliance of 13 percent in 2023. Achieving self-sufficiency in steel production would require only an additional 12 million tons of steel each year, significantly less than the product of increasing capacity utilization to 85 percent.

While increasing steel industry capacity utilization rates or reducing U.S. imports of foreign steel may arguably be valuable policy goals, a production tax credit for metallurgical coal is an unnecessary, and even detrimental, strategy. The U.S. already produces significantly more metallurgical coal than is needed for increasing domestic steel production. As a result, the One Big Beautiful Act’s metallurgical coal tax credit will end up subsidizing steel production for the many countries that import U.S. metallurgical coal, including China, India, and Japan—who already produce more steel than the U.S.

Does metallurgical coal warrant any federal support?

Metallurgical coal clearly poses value to modern society as an ingredient for producing ubiquitous steel alloys used in everything from building materials to automobiles. Alternatives to coke in steelmaking, like hydrogen, or new approaches to steelmaking, like molten oxide electrolysis, are promising, but will likely take years of further development before seeing initial commercial viability, ensuring the need for metallurgical coal for the foreseeable future. The tax credit, however, will cost the U.S. roughly $190 million a year assuming a production cost of $110 per ton. Meanwhile, the U.S. could pursue more prudent and cost effective approaches to support metallurgical coal.

Least of all, the U.S. should preserve access to portions of federal land suitable for mining metallurgical coal. Growing ambitions to displace coal power plants have encouraged bans on federal coal leases with the latest attempts occurring under the Biden and Obama administrations. Future attempts to ban coal tracts may not specify thermal coal used for power generation and thus needlessly lock up land with metallurgical coal reserves. Therefore, the U.S. should protect access to federal land specifically with metallurgical coal to avoid the possibility of future complications as energy policy debates continue to target coal power.

Proper management of federal land that contains metallurgical coal should also include regular reserve assessments. Currently, the Department of Energy does not report reserves for metallurgical coal specifically and the U.S. Geological Survey has only conducted sporadic assessments. Access to current information on reserves will allow land management agencies to better foresee future supply shortages. In such a case, the federal government could aid the private sector in expanding the domestic reserve base through publicly funded exploration programs such as the Earth Mapping Resource Initiative operated by the U.S. Geological Survey. Metallurgical coal is currently produced almost exclusively in the Appalachia region. So, state and federal exploration programs could absorb part of the risk and learning curve in trying to expand production beyond these historical districts. At $75 million a year, the Earth Mapping Resource Initiative costs half of the metallurgical coal subsidies and could easily expand reserves of both metallurgical coal and critical minerals through shared exploration techniques. Its funding, however, will drastically reduce as appropriations from the Inflation Reduction Act expire in 2026

The U.S. may ultimately benefit the most in the long term by funding research that reduces the amount of metallurgical coal consumed when making steel. Here, breakthrough innovations that improve the material efficiency of steel facilities would avoid perpetual subsidies and decouple the U.S. steel sector from future depletion of domestic metallurgical coal reserves. Meanwhile, investments in direct reduced iron and molten oxide electrolysis ironmaking facilities would increase U.S. capacity for producing virgin steel in electric arc furnaces using domestic iron ore, as electric arc furnaces otherwise rely on scrap steel and primarily produce recycled steel. Note, however, that while these advancements may help reduce dependencies of the U.S. steel sector on metallurgical coal, they would also benefit foreign steel producers should the U.S. continue to mine and export metallurgical coal at similar levels.

Final verdict: the federal government could support metallurgical coal while prioritizing critical mineral dollars elsewhere

The funds for metallurgical coal production tax credits would arguably provide the U.S. with greater strategic value if applied to any official critical mineral with promising domestic reserves, in particular those that China dominates global production.

The U.S., for instance, has multiple mines in the permitting pipeline which will constitute the first domestic sources of graphite since the 1950s. Graphite holds clear economic and strategic importance for battery and energy storage technologies, advanced materials, and key industrial applications. Meanwhile, the graphite market globally confronts a virtual monopoly with China as the world’s overwhelmingly leading producer. A production tax credit for graphite could help buffer the learning curve for U.S. graphite mine and processing projects while they catch up and gain expertise.

Alternatively, the U.S. can offer grants for projects precisely where critical mineral supply chains need them most. Federal funding can greatly improve the security of domestic supply chains by helping bring even just a single facility online. The Mountain Pass rare earth mine in California received two grants in 2020 and 2022 totaling ~$45 million from the Department of Defense to expand the operation from just a mine to a complete processing supply chain. Instead of spending $180 million per year to subsidize metallurgical coal, the federal government could help bring online multiple critical mineral facilities.

Metallurgical coal’s widespread use in steel and alloy manufacturing warrants forward looking, strategic thinking. A production tax credit, however, is simply not necessary—especially given the subsidization effects benefitting overseas steel producers. Preserving access to federal land that contains metallurgical coal, expanding domestic reserves through concerted mineral exploration campaigns, and researching improvements in the technical capabilities of US steel manufacturers represent forms of federal support that can address actual barriers for metallurgical coal production all more cost effectively than a production tax credit.",https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/USSteel.jpeg?mtime=1754673997,N,,2025-08-08 16:10:31.962289

Its mission is to celebrate the Ohio River while honoring the history of the land itself.

Conservancy CEO Dennis Schnurbusch said the work so far has included property acquisition, planning and design and starting to prepare the space.

“This land is comprised entirely of junkyards, brownfields, landfills, things that have been abused,” he said. “It's not like we're starting from scratch with land that you've purchased that doesn't maybe…have those types of challenges associated with them.”

The organization has secured around 80% of needed land, including some through an agreement with the town of Clarksville. Two former junkyards are being cleaned up. And last year, crews broke ground at an events center expected to help generate revenue to sustain the park. Other big projects are in the works.

“Now we’re getting to the fun part, which is the build-out on it,” Schnurbusch said.

Subhed: Upcoming projects

Schnurbusch said River Heritage Conservancy is focusing on three main projects for now.

At Buttonbush Woods, there is already nearly a mile of rough-cut trails, with plans for expanded paths. Schnurbusch said they still have to do a lot in terms of restoring streams and removing invasive plant species.

“It's 103 acres of beautiful, natural landscape that we want to make sure [is] protected, but…it needs some love right now, and we're working on that,” Schnurbusch said.

The Vista, a roughly 14,000-square-foot events center overlooking Buttonbush Woods, the Ohio River and Ohio River Greenway, is slated to open in spring. It will hold more than 400 people, depending on the type of event. It’s taking reservations now.

Designs are also in place for a whitewater facility to be built within the park. That’s being designed by the group behind the U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Schnurbusch said they hope to be able to host Olympic trials, along with more casual water recreation. They hope to open by 2029, depending on funding. It’s part of an adventure park including zip lines and climbing.

A destination

Officials say the park will offer more amenities for local residents and be a huge economic driver for the area. Schnurbusch said they expect around 1-1.5 million people will visit annually.

Jim Epperson, executive director at SoIN Tourism, said a park of this scale — even without the events center and adventure park with whitewater rafting — would be a great attraction. But those elements change the game.

“The more primary motivations we have on this side of the river…it's an anchor,” he said. “It's a new reason to visit, and it's a…reason to visit again, beyond what we have, which is a collection of great experiences.”

The origins before Origin Park

The word “origin” in the park’s name hearkens back to who and what was here before, and RHC Board Member Jim Kenney said there is much history to be told.

He said it started with glacier activity that formed the Ohio River and Falls of the Ohio, near Origin Park. He said these environmental features forced indigenous people and later European settlers to portage or stop there.

Meriwether Lewis and William Clark started on their expedition of the Northwest Territory from the area and George Rogers Clark had a homestead near the Falls. Buffalo crossed into the Origin Park area from the salt licks of Kentucky. Kenney said there were places operating within the Origin Park footprint during Prohibition, and it was also a spot for duels, which are illegal in Kentucky.

“Had it not been for the glaciers and the Falls of the Ohio…we'd be just another little sleepy river town,” he said. But because they did, there’s a lot of stories to tell about the history of the area.

Ongoing litigation

A low-head dam in Silver Creek that RHC wants to remove as part of a planned “blueway” has been the subject of ongoing litigation for the past several years.

The waterway borders Origin Park between Clarksville and New Albany. Four years ago, a contractor for the conservancy secured a permit to take out the Providence Mill Dam. New Albany continues to fight that effort in court.

The city is also involved in other court cases after a teen drowned at the site last May, and after Mayor Jeff Gahan had rocks placed at the dam to stop the reverse current below it. State and federal agencies say that was done without proper permitting.

Schnurbusch said the conservancy doesn’t own the creek and doesn’t plan to do anything commercial there, but wants to see the dam removed for safety and environmental reasons.

RHC recently helped pay for removal of the Blackiston Mill Dam on another part of the creek.

“We're not doing anything to Silver Creek except trying to make sure that that blueway is open and restored naturally, so that the habitat can grow and act like it's supposed to,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6a7c83/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2Ff1%2F0b813d0645dd9f9832c6cd52ebf2%2Fimg-3577.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 14:03:57.950537

Democratic U.S. House members from North Carolina on Thursday condemned the Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to cancel $7 billion in grants for the Solar for All program, created under the Biden administration to expand access to solar energy in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

Among those grants was $156 million awarded April 2024 to a state coalition—the N.C. Clean Energy Fund, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Advanced Energy and the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center.

That effort had received about $1 million in early planning funds as of March 2025, according to DEQ spokesperson Sascha Medina, but a recent dollar figure was not immediately available.

“We strongly urge you to reverse this decision, which will raise energy costs for our constituents, eliminate North Carolina jobs, and negatively impact communities across our state,” the members wrote.

U.S. Reps. Deborah Ross, Valerie Foushee, Don Davis and Alma Adams signed the letter.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the move Thursday on the social-media site X, formerly Twitter, pointing to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as the reason: “EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The Trump administration’s interpretation of the new law is sure to widen the litigation it finds itself in over its handling of most of the climate-related programs that Congress passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

In the new law, Congress did not and could not rescind the programs entirely. It only rescinded the relatively small amount of money that the Biden administration had not obligated to grantees. But the Trump administration is arguing that the impact was the same as if Congress ended the programs entirely, since it now lacks the money that was left behind to administer the programs.

The North Carolina House Democrats wrote that the EPA’s action could violate federal law.

“North Carolina has long been a leader in the clean energy economy, and this Administration’s actions over the past seven months are putting billions of dollars in economic investment in our state at risk,” the members wrote. “Again, we strongly urge you to reconsider this reckless and illegal course of action.”

In Washington, Patrick Drupp, climate policy director for the Sierra Club, blasted President Donald Trump for propping up the fossil fuel industry in a “made up” national energy emergency while taking a “sledgehammer” to renewable energy projects.

“Solar energy is cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable than dirty fossil fuels,” Drupp said in a statement. “By rescinding these grants, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are denying our most vulnerable communities a resource that would have helped alleviate their financial burdens and improved their quality of life.”

The program has 60 grantees across the country, in North Carolina and in 48 other states, as well as six Native American tribes and five multi-state coalitions. Nationally, the program would have provided solar energy to 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities, a mix of rooftop solar and subscription-based community solar, the Biden administration said last year.

In North Carolina, the Solar for All grant was intended to serve 12,500 low-income and disadvantaged communities across the state, including state- and federally recognized tribal lands, according to DEQ. The plan was to launch at least 43 megawatts of residential solar by the end of the five-year program.

DEQ spokesman Josh Kastrinsky said the agency is “aware of the recent message on social media but have no formal communication from EPA on the program.”

The program is part of the broader Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and the administration has already sought to cancel funding for the “green bank” programs that make up the bulk of the fund.

Steve Kalland, executive director of the N.C. Clean Energy Technology Center, told Inside Climate News that the state’s Solar for All program is designing “innovative pilot programs,” including a solar-plus-battery option for households that have critical medical devices, like electric oxygen concentrators.

Solar for All in North Carolina would undertake several ambitious projects for both eligible single-family homes and multifamily housing owned and operated by nonprofit and public organizations. It also planned to launch a community solar pilot program, including with municipal utilities and electric co-ops.

North Carolina is a good location for solar projects. In 2023, it ranked fourth in the nation in solar generating capacity, with nearly 6,600 megawatts, and fifth in total solar power generation, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. But it’s also adding natural-gas infrastructure at a fast clip.

“North Carolinians are experiencing record-high energy bills, rising costs driven largely by our reliance on fossil fuel power plants,” said David Kelly, North Carolina state director of the Environmental Defense Fund. “The Solar for All program is aimed squarely at lowering household energy costs, recognizing that clean energy is more affordable than outdated, polluting power sources. Cancelling these funds will make it harder for working families to afford their utility bills.”

EPA took a historic step in furthering its deregulatory agenda: EPA published a proposal to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding for GHGs. EPA now asserts that section 202(a) of the CAA was never intended to reach global climate concerns; that intervening Supreme Court precedent limits reliance on implied authority; and that post-2009 scientific developments undercut the original determination that six ""well-mixed"" GHGs endanger public health and welfare. If finalized, the proposal would eliminate all federal GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles; terminate the regulatory architecture that has guided the automotive industry for more than a decade; and remove the legal linchpin on which subsequent GHG regulations under the CAA for other industries were built.

The Effect of the Proposed Rule

Section 202(a) of the CAA provides that EPA must regulate classes of new motor vehicles that, in EPA's judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. The 2009 Endangerment Finding determined that six GHGs endanger the public health and welfare, giving EPA the ability to regulate them for motor vehicles.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding also became the underlying authority to regulate GHGs more broadly under the CAA. Through subsequent decisions and agency rulemaking, EPA deemed the 2009 Endangerment Finding sufficient to regulate GHGs in other industries, such as stationary sources and jet engines. The effect of the proposed rule extends far beyond the regulation of motor vehicles by removing the justification for other GHG regulations under the CAA. EPA has initiated or plans to initiate separate rulemakings to address these other GHG regulations.

The proposal will directly affect companies involved in the applicable vehicle and engine categories because the companies will no longer need to comply with the regulations. The proposal could result in substantial cost savings, especially for companies focused on traditional vehicle technologies. However, EPA is not currently modifying any criteria pollutant or air toxic standards, Corporate Average Fuel Economy testing, or associated fuel economy labeling requirements. As a result, the standards will remain the same for criteria pollutants and air toxics under the CAA, gas mileage on passenger cars and lights trucks, and environmental labels on vehicles for sale.

In addition to reducing regulatory burdens, the removal of federal GHG standards more broadly may create uncertainty for companies that are navigating differing state (and for multinational companies, global) laws, varying market dynamics, and previously planned investments in renewable energy technologies and infrastructure.

The Reason for Rescission

EPA presents a new interpretation of section 202 to justify the rescission of the Endangerment Finding. It states that section 202(a) targets pollutants threatening health or welfare through local or regional exposure, not global atmospheric phenomena. EPA relies on historical uses of section 202(a), which, prior to 2009, was only used to regulate air pollutants that threatened public welfare through local or regional exposure.

Separately, EPA states that regulating GHGs to address climate change runs afoul of the major questions doctrine, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in West Virginia v. EPA, because Congress did not give EPA clear authorization to address this question. EPA references the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as evidence that Congress intended to reserve the question of climate change action for itself.

In the alternative, EPA argues that post-2009 scientific developments have eroded scientific support for the Endangerment Finding. EPA references scientific discoveries, including GHG concentrations tracking more optimistic models, uncertainty regarding the health impacts of temperature increases, and uncertainty in the connection between increased global temperatures and extreme weather.

Potential Challenges to the Rule

If finalized, this rule will almost certainly be challenged. EPA's reasoning for proposing a new interpretation of the statute may end up being one basis for challenging the rule. EPA states that the landmark decision in Loper Bright requires the best reading of the authoritative statute, which is to be determined by judges, not agencies. After Loper Bright, EPA will not receive deference for its CAA interpretation, and challengers to the rule will likely argue that EPA's regional limitation of an air pollutant is not supported by the text.

The rule will likely also be challenged on scientific grounds. Because Loper Bright only applies to statutory interpretation, EPA's scientific findings are likely to receive some deference. Opponents may still argue that the rescission is arbitrary under the Administrative Procedure Act because EPA failed to provide a ""reasoned explanation"" for departing from settled precedent, understated benefits of regulating GHGs, and overstated scientific uncertainty.",https://www.jonesday.com/-/media/images/publications/2025/08/new-epa-positions-reflected-in-sweeping-rollback-of-ghg-regulation/imageoverrideforopengraph/new-epa-positions-reflected-in-sweeping-rollback.jpeg?rev=0f90d483570245878dd2de8bec379135&hash=D58904E4FC8FCEB089186E8749A697EC,N,,2025-08-08 14:02:37.516368

But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

This aligns with Governor Sanders' and Commerce Secretary Hugh McDonald's vision of leveraging Arkansas' world-class lithium reserves to attract the best upstream and midstream technology providers, maximize statewide economic benefits, and reduce reliance on adversarial supply chains. The strength of ALTA's first cohort, featuring Nano One and supported by industry leaders like founding partner Standard Lithium, is a good first step toward turning that vision into a true lithium economy.""

Participation in ALTA enabled Nano One to engage with key stakeholders in government, industry, academia, and the investment community. The Company toured Standard Lithium's demonstration facilities, gaining valuable perspective on Arkansas' lithium resources and the state's commitment to innovation. Arkansas' pro-business environment, strong ties to defence, and legacy in natural resource development make it an ideal partner in the localization of lithium supply chains. This includes extraction, refining and value-added processing into LFP cathode materials for battery energy storage systems (BESS)-a cornerstone of future-ready grid infrastructure-AI data centers, military and automotive applications.

The program culminated in Demo Day, showcasing the collective strength of ALTA's inaugural cohort. Nano One was one of only three companies selected to participate, alongside leaders in lithium processing and geothermal technology. Backed by Standard Lithium, the Walton Family Foundation, and a network of Arkansas-based producers, government agencies, and institutions, ALTA is fostering next-generation collaboration between emerging innovators and established players.

Nano One is the only OBBB-ready solution for LFP that can directly link upstream mineral extraction to downstream cell manufacturing. The Company's One-Pot™ process vertically integrates precursor preparation with processing to drive down cost and it also eliminates foreign-controlled inputs, wastewater byproducts, and permitting barriers that challenge traditional cathode supply chains. It enables cost-effective, modular deployment of localized CAM production across North America.

""ALTA broadened our exposure to US energy growth, its security mandate and localization efforts in Arkansas' ecosystem,"" said Dan Blondal, CEO of Nano One. ""Our technology is purpose-built for North American scale-up, and the interest we received confirms that our strategy is accurately focused on a large opportunity in Arkansas that is real and growing. We look forward to working with ALTA to nurture and deepen our presence, collaborations and partnerships across the region.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is inviting small businesses, governments, and not-for-profits to participate as Small Entity Representatives (SERs) providing advice and recommendations for two separate Small Business Advocacy Review (SBAR) Panels. One SBAR Panel will focus on the agency’s development of a proposed rule to address unreasonable risk identified in EPA’s Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) risk evaluation for asbestos part 2. A separate SBAR Panel will focus on the agency’s development of a proposed rule to address unreasonable risk identified in EPA’s TSCA risk evaluation for formaldehyde.

Under TSCA, EPA is required to evaluate the potential risk of existing chemicals in commerce before taking action to address any unreasonable risk. The agency issued the asbestos part 2 final risk evaluation for legacy uses and associated disposals of asbestos including chrysotile asbestos and five additional asbestos fiber types in November 2024, showing unreasonable risk to human health, primarily for workers. The agency also issued the formaldehyde final risk evaluation in January 2025, showing unreasonable risk to workers and consumers under certain conditions of use. EPA is now beginning the next risk management step in the TSCA process and will draft regulations to protect public health from the unreasonable risks identified in the final risk evaluations. The agency is still determining if SBAR panels are necessary for tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), diisononyl phthalate (1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, 1,2-isononyl ester) (DINP) and diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP). The TSCA risk evaluation for TCEP was completed in September 2024 and the TSCA risk evaluations for DINP and DIDP were completed in January 2025. These three chemicals will also be moving to risk management which is the next step in the TSCA process.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to establish an SBAR Panel for rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The SBAR Panels will include federal representatives from the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the EPA. The members of the Panels ask a selected group of SERs to provide advice and recommendations on behalf of their company, government, or organization to inform the members of the Panels about potential impacts of the proposed rules on small entities.

EPA seeks self-nominations directly from the small entities that may be subject to the requirements of these two rules. Other representatives, such as trade associations that exclusively or at least primarily represent potentially regulated small entities, may also serve as SERs.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-standard-og.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 16:11:42.123644

Have incentives affected registration results in two big European new-car markets? How are US tariffs impacting carmaker forecasts? Which company is buying up Northvolt? Autovista24 editor Tom Geggus presents the latest Automotive Update.

In this week’s episode, special content editor Phil Curry talks about battery-electric vehicle (BEV) incentives in the UK. Then, Geggus explores the latest new-car registration figures in Germany. Finally, a US battery manufacturer is acquiring Northvolt, but what exactly has been bought?

UK incentives prove difficult

In July, the UK government introduced incentives for BEV purchases. The new subsidies offer £3,750 (€4,324) for the most sustainable models, and £1,500 for those with lower green credentials. However, it could be difficult for carmakers to achieve a placing in the top band for discounts.

According to the Independent, to qualify for the incentive scheme, manufacturers must have committed to a science-based target on emissions. They also need a pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Funding is based on the carbon emissions of the country where key production stages are located. These include vehicle assembly, where the powertrain is introduced, and the battery production location.

At the time of writing, only four models from Citroen have been awarded the lower level of funding. It appears that achieving the maximum discount amount will prove difficult.

The incentives were introduced too late to impact UK registrations in July, which were down by 5% year on year. BEV deliveries grew by 9.1%, although this was their second-smallest improvement so far in 2025.

German BEV market bouncing back?

July was the first time since April 2024 that the German new-car market recorded double-digit year-on-year growth. 264,802 models took to the roads, registrations were up by 11.1%.

BEV registrations rose by 58% in July to 48,614 units. The technology captured an 18.4% share last month, up from a 12.9% market hold in July 2024.

The country also has a new incentives scheme in place. This offers tax breaks for corporate BEV purchases from July 2025 to December 2027. This means private buyers and lessees do not benefit from the plans.

The incentives seem to have had little impact in July, with the market returning to buoyancy following a difficult 2023. Last year, the market appeared to be struggling with comparisons set against a much stronger 2023, when incentives were active.

Comparing last month’s BEV figures with July 2023 deliveries, the all-electric market dropped by just 0.1%. In the first seven months of 2025, BEVs were up by 10.6% on the same period two years ago.

German automotive bodies highlighted that growth has been bolstered by a greater availability of models across the volume segments. Therefore, incentives do not appear to be a key driver of BEV growth at present.

Tariff impact on financial results

The latest round of carmaker quarterly financial results has revealed the impact US tariffs. The automotive industry took an $11.8 billion (€10.1 billion) hit in the first half of 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Toyota estimates a ¥1.4 trillion (€8.1 billion) tariff impact on its operating income through its current financial year. Meanwhile, General Motors expects the situation to worsen in the third quarter, Reuters reported. It committed to previous estimates that trade headwinds will hit its bottom line by up to $5 billion this year.

Stellantis estimates a 2025 net tariff impact of approximately €1.5 billion. Ford now anticipates full-year adjusted EBIT of $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, which includes a net tariff-related headwind of around $2 billion.

Lyten buys Northvolt

US battery maker Lyten has entered into a binding agreement to acquire Northvolt’s remaining assets in Sweden and Germany.

The deal includes Northvolt Ett and Ett Expansion, as well as Northvolt Labs in Sweden and Northvolt Drei in Germany. Lyten is also acquiring all of Northvolt’s remaining intellectual property. Multiple members of the executive team also plan to join the US firm.

Lyten’s newly acquired assets are valued at approximately $5 billion.

EPA is reportedly drafting termination letters purporting to cancel all 60 awards—totaling $7 billion—made under the Inflation Reduction Act's Solar for All program.

The threatened terminations are the latest example of the Trump administration's broader efforts to claw back climate and infrastructure funding appropriated by Congress.

If finalized, the terminations would almost certainly prompt swift litigation challenging EPA's action as contrary to the awards' terms and conditions, federal regulations and statutes, and the U.S. Constitution.

According to recent reporting, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") is currently drafting grant termination letters purporting to cancel all 60 grants—totaling a combined $7 billion—awarded under the Solar for All (""SFA"") program. SFA is part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (""GGRF""), a $27 billion program created by Congress as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA""). The $7 billion in SFA funds were awarded to 60 recipients (including states, municipalities, non-profit organizations, and federally recognized tribes) following a grant competition in 2024. Those recipients, in turn, are deploying the funds to assist approximately 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households install rooftop or community-scale solar power systems, which are projected to lower participating families' utility bills by more than $350 million annually.

The EPA's purported basis for terminating the awards is not yet known. The termination letters could be sent by the end of this week.

This latest move is part of a larger series of efforts by the administration to claw back IRA and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act funds appropriated by Congress and, in many cases, already obligated under binding contracts. Shortly after President Trump's inauguration, EPA attempted to terminate $20 billion in awards made pursuant to the two other GGRF programs, the National Clean Investment Fund (""NCIF"") and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (""CCIA""). Award recipients under those programs quickly challenged the legality of those terminations and obtained a preliminary injunction from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia halting EPA's efforts. EPA subsequently appealed that decision, and the case is pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. (Foley Hoag represents Power Forward Communities, Inc., the recipient of $2 billion in NCIF funding, in that litigation.)

Until today, however, SFA recipients had largely avoided EPA's termination efforts. While EPA temporarily froze the SFA grants earlier this year, the agency later unfroze the funds, sparing the program from the same termination fate as the NCIF and CCIA programs—at least for a time. Indeed, lawyers for EPA expressly highlighted the fact that it had not terminated any SFA awards during the litigation regarding the NCIF and CCIA awards. This recent news represents a considerable escalation on EPA's part.

EPA's termination efforts are likely to invite strong legal challenges, including on many of the same grounds currently being litigated in the cases brought by NCIF and CCIA recipients. Although the reason EPA may give for terminating the SFA awards is unclear, the awards' terms and conditions and federal regulations limit the bases for termination. Under many, if not all, of the awards, EPA may only terminate an award ""when the noncompliance with the terms and conditions is substantial such that effective performance of the Assistance Agreement is Materially Impaired or there is adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse, or material misrepresentation of eligibility status."" And federal regulations provide that an agency may terminate an award only ""pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award."" Further, wholesale termination of the SFA program for reasons not provided by either law or contract may prompt a variety of statutory and constitutional claims.

Our team is closely tracking these developments and is available to assist entities with SFA grants facing potential termination.

Palisades is one of several retired nuclear plants nationwide which are moving toward possible restart to bolster U.S. power generation capacity in the era of rising data center load.
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission last month approved Holtec’s request to return Palisades to an operating license.
Holtec also hopes to locate future small modular reactors alongside the Palisades plant.
Palisades will be the first U.S. nuclear power plant to restart operations after retirement if Holtec meets its timetable.","The company working to restart the retired Palisades Nuclear Station along the southeastern shore of Lake Michigan has received another $83.2 million disbursed from its $1.52 billion federal loan guarantee to fund the recommissioning of the plant after three-plus years of closure.

This is the fifth U.S. Department of Energy disbursement to Holtec International, the firm which handled decommissioning and caretaker duties and is now working to restart the Palisades plant in Van Buren County, Michigan.

Palisades is one of several retired nuclear plants nationwide which are moving toward possible restart to bolster U.S. power generation capacity in the era of rising data center load.

The original $1.52 billion loan guarantee was finalized in late 2024 under the Biden-era Energy Department. This time around, the Trump Administration’s DOE is reaffirming its commitment to expand nuclear capacity across the U.S.

“The Department of Energy is working in tandem with our regulatory partners to accelerate the reopening of the Palisades Nuclear Plant and unleash a true American nuclear renaissance,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement. “These efforts will help reinvigorate our nuclear industrial base, deliver lower energy costs for millions of Americans and strengthen our nation’s energy security.”

Palisades Nuclear Station was built in the late 1960s to early 1970s and commissioned in 1974. It has one pressurized water reactor and connected turbine generator capable of close to 725 MW in generation capacity. The plant has gone through several owners, including CMS Energy and Entergy, before being sold to Holtec and closed in 2022.

Holtec has also received about $300 million in state of Michigan funding to help in the restart. To date, the federal disbursement has totaled $335 million.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission last month approved Holtec’s request to return Palisades to an operating license. More than 600 workers are employed on the restart project hoping to complete in the next year.

“This milestone is a testament to the expertise and determination of Holtec’s licensing team, whose work made this historic approval possible. It also reflects the dedication of the Palisades team working every day to safely return the plant to service, along with the strong support we’ve received from our corporate organization and peers across the nuclear industry,” read a Holtec company statement on the NRC approval.

Holtec also hopes to locate future small modular reactors alongside the Palisades plant. Nuclear power generation does not emit greenhouse gases and offers baseload-level power to bolster a grid facing an anticipated 125 GW in load growth around new artificial intelligence and data center capacity.

Constellation is also working to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 in Pennsylvania thanks to a long-term power purchase agreement with Microsoft.

Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft also has signed up to support development of nuclear fusion technologies such as Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Thea Energy.

Eaton is also increasing supplies of power distribution solutions, including transformers and voltage regulators, as well as electrical assemblies: switchgear, switchboards, and circuit breakers; and solutions supporting electric grid infrastructure projects.

A ‘critical’ shortage

The U.S. is in the middle of an unprecedented imbalance between supply and demand for power transformers, which has left the energy sector anxious and uncertain about the stability of the future grid.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills. Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.

Now, the fate of the program is in question, the Trump administration argues, because of a massive spending and tax bill Republicans passed last month.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country. Also, rooftop and community solar can help households avoid power shutoffs, which are dangerous in extreme heat and cold.

The Solar for All program, and the solar projects across the country, would have meant significant greenhouse gas reductions, says Costa Samaras, director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. ""We need all the clean power we can get right now,"" he says.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy.
But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire.","The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.

As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.

“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”

Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.

“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.

“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”

But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.

“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”

Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.

State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.

But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.

Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”

While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.

“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.

A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.

“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.

“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”

Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.

“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.

Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.

Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.

“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”

Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.

“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”

“We need more cars in the $30,000 to $35,000 range, with good range.” Plug in America, which advocates for EVs, mourns the loss of the tax credit.
Ingrid Malmgren, the group’s senior policy director, said the end of the EV credit is a blow to the auto industry.
There are some nuances to the extra $10,000 credit buyers should be aware of, Malmgren added.
“The auto loan interest deduction pales in comparison to the EV tax credits.","Through a unique set of circumstances that are unlikely to be repeated, consumers have until Sept. 30 to take advantage of up to $17,500 in savings for buying an electric vehicle in the U.S. The amount could be even more for residents of some states that offer their own incentives.

This “stacking” window expires at the end of September because that’s when Congress decided to sunset the President Biden-era version of the up-to-$7,500 federal income tax credit. It should be noted, the credits are subject to both income and vehicle price caps, and the vehicle in question has to meet North American final assembly, battery and mineral sourcing rules. Smaller credits apply to the purchase of some used EVs.

Add to that the potential $10,000 savings that comes via the mega tax and spending bill, which contains an allowance for deducting car loan interest. Those savings are on qualifying cars or trucks (not only EVs) purchased between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, so it’s got a retroactive provision. The deductions are available for single taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income is $100,000 or less, or married couples earning $200,000 or less.

Cars to Consider

As an example of what’s possible with the double-decker incentives now in place, the three-row Lucid Gravity SUV—one of the most exciting EVs on the market—now lists for $81,400. With the federal rebate and the tax deductions adding up over time, the actual purchase price would be $63,900.

A more affordable EV SUV, one that’s highly regarded, is the Hyundai IONIQ 5, which starts at $42,600. Would you buy it for $25,100? That’s entry-level vehicle territory. Even if you opt for the most expensive $57,100 XRT trim—which adds such cool features as black digital camo cladding, a pixelated front grille, a 23-millimeter suspension lift, all-terrain tires, and unique front and rear bumpers—the bottom line is still only $39,600. That’s well under the average price Americans pay for any car, EV or gas.

Both these cars are made in the U.S. And there’s always the possibility of your state adding inducements on top of the federal options.

“If you’ve been waiting on the sidelines to buy an EV, now is the time. After that September deadline, the challenges will start to mount up for EV buyers,” said Todd Cassidy, managing director in the investment banking group at Portage Point Partners.Cassidy said the loss of the federal tax credit will largely affect such EV startups as Rivian and Lucid, which have relatively higher-priced vehicles that are struggling to increase market share.

Future of Affordability

Chris Harto, senior policy analyst at Consumer Reports, agrees that now could be the time to pull the trigger “for anyone who’s been on the fence about buying an EV.”

Harto said that the nonprofit group has supported incentives for EVs “to make them more affordable for consumers,” but did not actively campaign to keep the federal tax credit. Instead, Harto called on automakers to produce more affordable EVs.

“The market is saturated with EVs in the $50,000 to $60,000 range,” he told Mansion Global. “We need more cars in the $30,000 to $35,000 range, with good range.”

Plug in America, which advocates for EVs, mourns the loss of the tax credit. Ingrid Malmgren, the group’s senior policy director, said the end of the EV credit is a blow to the auto industry.

“We expect to see a run on EVs until Sept. 30 and then a drop in sales, but EVs are here to stay,” Malmgren said.

There are some nuances to the extra $10,000 credit buyers should be aware of, Malmgren added. “The auto loan interest deduction pales in comparison to the EV tax credits. It only lasts three years, is income-limited, and eligible cars are subject to final assembly in the U.S., which may be confusing for consumers. Foreign brands from Germany and Japan have vehicles that are assembled in the U.S., while U.S. automakers have assembly plants in Mexico.”

There are additional savings to be had depending on your state. California’s incentives remain strong for EV buyers, and include rebates of up to $7,500 for new EVs (including leases), and extend to battery EVs, plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and fuel-cell hydrogen vehicles. Electric motorcycles can get a $750 rebate. Oregon’s Charge Ahead Rebate will provide consumers who meet income requirements up to $5,000 for the purchase or lease of a used battery EV or PHEV, and up to $7,500 for a new one.

Massachusetts’ rebate is up to $3,500, but consumers who meet income guidelines can access another $1,500. A full list of state incentives is available here.

It hasn’t been a particularly good quarter for EV sales. According to the Cox Automotive/Kelley Blue Book Electric Vehicle Sales Report, the second quarter of 2025 saw sales down for many automakers. The Cadillac Lyriq sales of 5,017 marked a 31.2% decline from the same period in 2024. The electric Genesis GV70, with 469 sales, was down a whopping 67.9%. The Volvo C40 saw only 94 sales, down 71.2%.

Seeing sales increases were the Chevrolet Silverado, up 39.2% annually to 3,056; the Lucid Air, up 9.9% to 2,630; the Nissan Ariya, up 43.6% to 7,472; Porsche Taycan, up 31.8% to 1,064. Tesla was generally down, but the Model 3 was up 14.3% to 48,803. And the Chevrolet Equinox, which combines a low price ($33,600) with great range (up to 319 miles), was the bestselling EV that wasn’t a Tesla, with 17,420 sales.

Nicole Malliotakis (NY-11) , Jared Moskowitz (FL-23), and Mike Lawler (NY-17) led a bipartisan letter calling on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to immediately release information to Congress to help nonprofit organizations applying for Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) funding.

Currently, FEMA is withholding from Members of Congress the list of nonprofits in their districts that will be awarded Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP) awards this year — despite a longstanding precedent of sharing this information. This lack of transparency comes after a months-long delay in releasing awards and as nonprofits face a fast-approaching application deadline for next year’s funding. Without knowing whether they were awarded funds, countless synagogues, churches, mosques, and other nonprofit organizations and religious institutions are unable to plan and complete applications for next year’s round of NSGP funding for much-needed security investments.

The bipartisan letter calls on the Trump Administration to immediately provide congressional offices with the list of June grant awardees — a commonsense step that has long been precedent in past years and would allow nonprofits to submit accurate applications ahead of the fast-approaching deadline.

The Nonprofit Security Grant Program provides critical funding to nonprofits at high risk of a terrorist attack, specifically faith-based institutions and houses of worship. The funding allows institutions to enhance their physical security and provide access to training to protect communities from the growing threat of hate and violence.

“We ask that you work with Congress and immediately share the list of awardees from June, as has been the normal course of business for FEMA, so that these non-profits at risk of attack can submit an accurate application before the deadline. As we wrote to FEMA back in March, the NSGP is one of the most effective and critical programs for protecting all faith-based communities from attack. There are numerous examples available that demonstrate the direct return on investment for communities under threat,” the Members of Congress wrote in the letter to Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson.

The Members continued, “The Administration has made clear its goal to protect Americans from terrorist threats as well as to respond to the rise in hate crimes. Therefore, it is imperative that eligible nonprofit organizations, including Jewish faith-based organizations, have the information they need to submit the best and most accurate application before the deadline. This requires cooperation to ensure that awardees are notified of their intent to receive funding from FEMA following the June announcement.”

“We thank Representative Gottheimer and the bipartisan group of lawmakers for their steadfast support of the NSGP, and especially for their commitment to protecting Jewish and other faith-based communities amid an unprecedented threat environment,” said Michael Masters, National Director and CEO of the Secure Community Network. “While the release of the FY2025 funding notice is a welcome development, the condensed application timeline presents real challenges. Timely and transparent communication is key to helping communities navigate the process effectively and maintain a proactive security posture.”

Read the full letter here and below:

Dear Acting Administrator Richardson,

We are writing to express our sincere concern following the Administration’s failure to share the list of awardees with congressional offices for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program (NSGP). In June, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that it awarded $94,416,838 to 512 Jewish faith-based organizations across the United States through the NSGP. This is following months of delay after the Administration decided to pause the drawdown of funding in order to conduct an additional review of all grant allocations. At a time when hate and violence against faith-based communities across this country are at historic levels, the NSGP has provided life-saving funding to protect faith-based communities and institutions. As members of Congress working diligently to ensure there are resources available to faith-based institutions to secure themselves against attack, it is extremely concerning that FEMA’s reason for not providing Congress with this information is because of a perceived “security concern.” FEMA has not informed Congress of the nature of this threat. This is not the normal course of business.

As you are aware, the process to apply for the NSGP is long and arduous. Most importantly, non-profit organizations must work with local law enforcement to secure a Security Assessment, which details the organization’s vulnerabilities and needs. Although FEMA took the positive step of releasing the Notification of Funding Opportunity for the FY2025 funding for the NSGP on July 28, organizations have limited time to complete their applications. With the announcement of the awards of the National Security Supplemental delayed until June and awardees unaware if they are recipients of this supplemental funding, non-profit organizations, especially faith-based organizations, face tremendous levels of anxiety and uncertainty. This is compounded by FEMA’s failure to notify congressional offices of the recipients in our respective districts. Following the deadly attacks in Washington, D.C., and Boulder, CO, Jewish institutions are notably anxiously awaiting these grants. Now these organizations are in limbo as they have no way to plan to effectuate the security upgrades they need or know what to apply for before the application deadline, leaving their security posture exposed and vulnerable.

We ask that you work with Congress and immediately share the list of awardees from June, as has been the normal course of business for FEMA, so that these non-profits at risk of attack can submit an accurate application before the deadline. As we wrote to FEMA back in March, the NSGP is one of the most effective and critical programs for protecting all faith-based communities from attack. There are numerous examples available that demonstrate the direct return on investment for communities under threat. It is no wonder that in FY2023, for the first time in the history of the program, all fifty-five eligible states and territories applied.

The Administration has made clear its goal to protect Americans from terrorist threats as well as to respond to the rise in hate crimes. Therefore, it is imperative that eligible nonprofit organizations, including Jewish faith-based organizations, have the information they need to submit the best and most accurate application before the deadline. This requires cooperation to ensure that awardees are notified of their intent to receive funding from FEMA following the June announcement.

In our continued support of the NSGP, we request a response including the full list of awardees no later than August 8, 2025.

Thank you for your attention to this pressing issue.

Sincerely,

MEMBER OF CONGRESS

This program would be the only statewide residential solar incentive program and without it, residential solar will not be a cost-effective option for low-income Oregonians.
The Solar for All program is crucial to meeting future energy needs in the Pacific Northwest while lowering household costs for working-class families.","Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley and U.S. Representative Janelle Bynum (OR-05) led their Oregon delegation colleagues—Senator Ron Wyden and Representatives Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Val Hoyle (OR-04), Andrea Salinas (OR-06), and Maxine Dexter (OR-03)—in demanding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) follow the law and immediately reverse its termination of an $86.6 million federal award to Oregon under the Solar for All Program.

“We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution,” the Oregon delegation wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought. “Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.”

The $86.6 million grant went to the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) to deploy a statewide Solar for All Program in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon. The funds—which were awarded under the historic Inflation Reduction Act and fully obligated—are intended to help create Oregon’s only statewide residential solar incentive program, but without them, working families across the state will struggle to harness the power of clean solar energy.

The lawmakers emphasized, “If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year.

As Ranking Member of the Senate Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee and a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, Merkley has led the charge to hold the EPA accountable for its disastrous funding freezes that have previously targeted the Solar for All program. He continues to use his position as the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees funding for the EPA to ensure the agency follows the law and has the necessary resources to carry out its mission of protecting human health and the environment.

“The EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program is a blatant failure of its duty to uphold enacted spending laws and ensure Americans have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Congress has yet to receive satisfactory responses and justifications for many of your unlawful and illogical actions. This is unacceptable and the agency must comply with the law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the livelihoods of all Americans and the environments where they live,” the delegation directed.

Mr. Zeldin and Mr. Vought:

We are appalled and outraged at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) blatant and unlawful termination of $7 billion in federal funding for the 60 organizations that received awards through the Solar for All program. Solar for All funding has been approved by Congress and signed into law, and cancelling or rescinding these obligated funds is a violation of the law and the Constitution. Solar for All funds help families across the nation access reliable energy at an affordable price. Solar energy is one of the cheapest and most reliable forms of energy, and solar deployment is critical to meeting the nation’s rapid growth in energy demand. Solar for All is fundamental to the EPA’s core mission of safeguarding human health and the environment, and your actions to illegally rescind these funds will result in even higher energy costs and a less reliable energy grid for families and Tribal communities.

In 2024, the State of Oregon received an $86.6 million award from the EPA to develop a statewide Solar for All program. These funds, awarded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, are fully obligated. Since January 2025, the Oregon Department of Energy (ODOE) has worked diligently in partnership with Bonneville Environmental Foundation and the Energy Trust of Oregon to design a cost-effective program with a focus on efficient procurement and project planning while also building strong partnerships with local community-based organizations across the state.

If fully funded and implemented, Oregon’s Solar for All program would serve over 8,000 low-income Oregon households, helping families install solar panels on their homes with little or no up-front costs. Until you terminated these funds, the state was on track to launch its Solar for All program and start offering incentives by the end of this year. Your recent actions have jeopardized these crucial services and stripped thousands of Oregonians of access to this cost-effective program.

If allowed to spend the federal funds it was legally awarded, the State of Oregon has plans to establish a program that would support solar panel installation on multi-family buildings and the development of community solar projects, while also investing in workforce development activities to ensure a robust and efficient solar industry in Oregon. This program would be the only statewide residential solar incentive program and without it, residential solar will not be a cost-effective option for low-income Oregonians. Now that the EPA has terminated federal Solar for All funds, thousands of low-income Oregonians will suffer from higher utility costs and less resilient energy sources.

The Solar for All program is crucial to meeting future energy needs in the Pacific Northwest while lowering household costs for working-class families. In Oregon, customers have suffered from exponentially increasing energy bills, with some utilities raising prices on residential households by 50% since 2020. Nationwide, the Solar for All program is on track to help more than 900,000 people install solar and reduce their electricity bills by at least 20 percent. The Solar for All program is designed to shield middle- and low-income families from these extreme price increases that place additional financial strain on households that are already struggling to pay their bills.

The EPA’s termination of the Solar for All program is a blatant failure of its duty to uphold enacted spending laws and ensure Americans have access to reliable and affordable electricity. Congress has yet to receive satisfactory responses and justifications for many of your unlawful and illogical actions. This is unacceptable and the agency must comply with the law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the livelihoods of all Americans and the environments where they live.

Additionally, on August 5, 2025, BOEM eliminated the requirement to publish a five-year schedule of offshore wind energy lease sales and to update the lease sale schedule every two years.
“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Secretary Burgum stated.
NYPS started that process in 2023, determining a need for a coordinated transmission project to deliver between 4.77 and 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy into New York City.
Federal decisions to halt the permitting and construction of offshore wind generation platforms make achieving New York’s offshore wind goal impossible in the near term and undermine the central purpose of its transmission solicitation.","Another day, another “beatings will continue until morale improves” moment for the U.S. offshore wind industry. According to a press release issued Thursday, the Department of the Interior is launching a full review of offshore wind energy regulations to “ensure alignment with the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and America’s energy priorities under President Donald J. Trump.”

The effort will include reviewing the Renewable Energy Modernization Rule, as well as financial assurance requirements and decommissioning cost estimates for offshore wind projects, to “ensure federal regulations do not provide preferential treatment to unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources over dependable, American-made energy.”

The review, led by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), will consider updates to rules under 30 CFR parts 585, 586, and 285. Interior believes this action supports Secretary’s Order 3437, “Ending Preferential Treatment for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources in Department Decision-Making,” Secretary’s Order 3438, “Managing Federal Energy Resources and Protecting the Environment,” and President Trump’s memorandum on wind energy signed on January 20, 2025.

“The Department is fully committed to making sure that offshore energy development reflects President Trump’s America First Energy Dominance agenda and the real-world demands of today’s global energy landscape,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “We’re taking a results-driven approach that prioritizes reliability, strengthens national security, and upholds both scientific integrity and responsible environmental stewardship.”

Interior says the effort also supports Executive Order 14315, which directs agencies to identify and “eliminate favoritism toward unreliable energy sources.” The Department has paused new approvals for offshore wind projects, including leases, permits, rights-of-way, and loans, in compliance with the Presidential Memorandum on wind energy, while it “conducts a review of offshore wind energy projects and their impact on the environment, national security, and the economy.”

In support of these presidential directives, BOEM rescinded all Designated Wind Energy Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf on July 30, 2025. Additionally, on August 5, 2025, BOEM eliminated the requirement to publish a five-year schedule of offshore wind energy lease sales and to update the lease sale schedule every two years.

Interior maintains it will continue to oversee the Outer Continental Shelf “with a clear focus on protecting American interests—advancing responsible energy production, safeguarding our environment and supporting long-term economic strength.”

The War on Wind Power

President Trump’s disdain for wind power has reached new heights in recent weeks.

Days removed from ensuring the demise of the U.S. offshore wind industry and effectively reneging on its associated promises of clean power and leaving a mess for states to deal with, the Trump administration is doing a solid for some legislators in Idaho who have been complaining about a particular wind project for years, canceling Magic Valley Energy’s 1,000 megawatt Lava Ridge Wind in Jerome, ID.

“Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is restoring common sense to American energy policy by reversing the Biden administration’s misguided, last-minute push to approve the Lava Ridge Wind Project, an enormous and unpopular 1,000-megawatt wind facility in southern Idaho, during the final days of the former president’s term,” reads the beginning of a decree issued Wednesday. “The Department of the Interior will no longer provide preferential treatment towards unreliable, intermittent power sources that harm rural communities, livelihoods, and the land, such as the Lava Ridge Wind Project and the radical Green New Scam agenda that burdens our nation and public lands.”

Last Friday, Secretary Burgum signed a Secretary’s Order that all but ensures developers of neither wind nor solar generation technology will break ground on federal lands by changing the way the department reviews energy projects. Now, in accordance with other anti-renewable proclamations from the President’s desk, Interior “will consider the proposed energy project’s capacity density when assessing the project’s potential energy benefits to the nation and impacts to the environment and wildlife.” Under the guise of more efficiently managing domestic resources, Burgum’s office will prioritize permitting those that “optimize energy generation while minimizing their environmental impact.” In short, that means greenlighting gas and coal development, since fossil fuels provide more energy density.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Secretary Burgum stated. “By considering energy generation optimization, the Department will be able to better manage our federal lands, minimize environmental impact, and maximize energy development to further President Donald Trump’s energy goals. This commonsense order ensures our nation is stronger, our land use is optimized, and the American people are properly informed.”

In late July, New York State pulled the plug on planning the massive transmission projects needed to bring offshore wind energy to shore, a harbinger of BOEM’s decision to cancel all OCS lease areas. The New York State Public Service Commission (NYPS) said canceling transmission plans would protect ratepayers from shouldering the burden of paying for a potential bridge to nowhere, citing “significant federal uncertainty” in the announcement of its strategic termination of its Public Policy Transmission Need (PPTN) process. NYPS started that process in 2023, determining a need for a coordinated transmission project to deliver between 4.77 and 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy into New York City.

U.S. & World

The day's top national and international news.

It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal.

“Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong — it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.”

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

“These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

“This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.”

Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”

“Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.

SoftBank, the Japanese investment holding company led by Masayoshi Son, is buying an electric vehicle plant in Ohio from major Apple supplier Foxconn, according to Bloomberg.

It’s a notable step for the company, which has been struggling to plan out the finances of its massive Stargate project – a joint effort by SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle and MGX to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure across the country.

Meta, meanwhile, has tapped US bond giant PIMCO and alternative asset manager Blue Owl to lead its $29 billion financing for data center expansion in rural Louisiana, a source familiar with the matter told The Post.

PIMCO will handle about $26 billion of debt while Blue Owl will contribute about $3 billion in equity, the source said.

SoftBank, Foxconn, Meta, PIMCO and Blue Owl did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comments.

Tech companies are racing to build powerful data centers across the nation, especially as President Trump calls for increased investment in the country.

SoftBank had approached Foxconn for help with its plan to build more massive data centers in the US, people familiar with the matter Bloomberg.

The sale of the EV plant is a result of those talks, according to the report.

Earlier this week, Hon Hai Precision Industry – Foxconn’s flagship unit – said it had agreed to sell the facility for $375 million to Crescent Dune LLC, though it did not disclose the company behind that entity.

Hon Hai’s stake in the data center project would be a major win for SoftBank. The Foxconn unit was an investor in SoftBank’s first venture capital fund.

The unit would operate the plant and use the facility for its own AI server manufacturing business, and perhaps to host a data center, according to a Bloomberg report.

SoftBank and Foxconn earlier this year invested $735 million each into a joint venture to build data centers in the US.

It is not clear whether SoftBank’s investment in that partnership includes its payment for the EV plant.

Meta has been working with Morgan Stanley to raise funds and find partners to back its AI push, according to Bloomberg.

The social media giant said last week that it planned to offload about $2 billion in data center assets as part of a strategy to share the costs of building these expensive facilities.

Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg had pledged hundreds of billions of dollars toward the effort in July when he announced the company’s superintelligence unit.

The firm’s first multi-gigawatt data center, called Prometheus, is expected to come online next year, Zuckerberg said last month.

Another planned facility called Hyperion will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over the next coming years, he added.

As data center expansion ramps up across the country, some US residents are pushing back – outraged over the massive water and energy use needed to maintain these facilities.

Local officials in Tucson, Ariz., effectively killed a $3.6 billion Amazon-linked data center project this week when they unanimously voted to pause discussions with its developers.

That vote required all staff to stop work on “Project Blue,” a data center slated to be built on 290 acres of land in Pima County.

Amazon did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.

While the county approved the sale of the land, the project still requires approval of its development plans.

Two in-person meetings about the project drew in crowds of 800 to 1,000 enraged residents, who protested the massive amounts of water and energy needed to power the data center, according to the Tucson Sentinel.

The project was expected to generate $250 million in tax revenue and create 3,000 temporary construction jobs – along with about 180 permanent positions earning an average salary of $64,000, according to the developers.

The automaker said it recently informed suppliers that a full-size electric pickup, scheduled for production at its BlueOval City assembly plant in Tennessee, will be delayed from 2027 to 2028.

In addition to this long-awaited successor to the F-150 Lightning electric pickup, Ford also delayed production of its E-transit van in Ohio from 2026 to 2028.

""F-150 Lightning, America's best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today's customer needs,"" the company said, adding that it ""will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.""

Automotive News earlier reported about the EV delays.

Chinese automakers have been driving down costs on electric vehicle production and offering lower-cost models for shoppers.

In response to this pressure, Ford and other car companies are focusing on producing affordable models on a streamlined platform, with a focus on delivering smaller electric vehicles.

""The pure EV market in the U.S. seems to us very clear: small vehicles used for commuting and around town,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley told analysts on an earnings call last week.

Ford, which has faced costly quality issues and leads the industry in recalls, previously projected losses of up to US$5.5 billion (RM23.3bil) in its electric vehicle and software operations for 2025.

Last year, the company scrapped plans for a three-row electric SUV, with Farley later stating that larger EV models are not the company's primary focus as it develops future battery-powered vehicles.

In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages.
""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI.
The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

Joining Growth Energy in celebration of the August 8th birthday are leaders from across the heartland, who have helped to make the RFS America's single most successful policy for increasing U.S. energy security, holding down fuel costs, reducing emissions, and strengthening the farm economy.

Since the RFS became law in August 2005, American biorefineries have produced more than 250 billion gallons of ethanol. In that same time period, American ethanol plants have purchased 92.7 billion bushels of corn, driving more than $425 billion of revenue to American farmers. As a result of these benefits, the program is supported by a broad, bipartisan spectrum of stakeholders.

Growth Energy

""The RFS is the foundation of America's bioeconomy,"" said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. ""It supports hundreds of thousands of rural jobs and has shielded an entire generation of drivers from volatility in global oil markets. More than 10 percent of U.S. fuel supplies now come from renewable sources like ethanol, representing billions of gallons in savings. And it's still fueling growth. As part of a drive toward U.S. energy dominance, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed to set biofuel blending at the highest volume in the history of the program. Those numbers aren't yet final, and the EPA still needs to address petitions from refiners seeking to skirt the RFS, but if we remain on a growth trajectory, the benefits to American motorists and farmers are overwhelming.""

Farmers

""The RFS is more than a law. It's a vital outlet for surplus grains that provides stability and prosperity to American farmers facing higher input costs and uncertain export markets,"" said Bill Couser, a farmer from Iowa who grows commercial corn that he sells to local plants to be processed into fuel ethanol. ""I don't know that our family's farm would be as strong as it is today if it weren't for the RFS and the American biofuels industry.""

""Since the RFS was enacted, America's net farm income has more than doubled. In Iowa alone, biofuel plants purchase more than half the state's corn crop — transforming it into homegrown fuels, high-quality animal feed, food-grade CO2, and a host of other co-products,"" said Kelly Nieuwenhuis, a third-generation corn and soybean farmer based in northwest Iowa. ""It's an integral part of the agricultural supply chain.""

Lawmakers

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard program has helped us produce fuel that reduces our emissions and fosters energy independence—and I'm proud to help continue leading the push in the Senate to increase the use and supply of American-grown, American-made biofuels across the country,"" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.). ""We're pushing hard for our bipartisan bill to enable the year-round sale of E15 nationwide, and as founding co-chair of the Sustainable Aviation Caucus in the Senate, I'm working to bolster and help expand our nation's sustainable aviation fuel industry. Investing in American biofuels doesn't just help us reduce our nation's carbon footprint—it helps lower gas prices for middle-class families and support our farmers. It's a win-win-win that would not be possible without the RFS.""

""Over the last 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been essential to empowering heartland communities, adding value to crops grown by our hardworking farmers, securing American energy independence, and giving consumers a cleaner, cheaper choice at the pump,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). ""Iowa farmers already feed our nation, and by guaranteeing homegrown Iowa biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply, the RFS secures their role in fueling our nation's future. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration to ensure the RFS stays strong, so we can keep delivering for Iowa's famers, biofuel producers, and rural communities.""

""Nebraska is the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol, and much of that is made possible by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), established 20 years ago,"" said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.). ""The RFS has played a critical role in supporting Nebraska's ag economy, driving both the use and production of renewable fuels across the state. I look forward to continuing to work with the EPA to ensure a strong RFS that will further advance Nebraska's biofuels industry.""

""The Renewable Fuel Standard is one of the federal government's most successful clean fuels policies,"" said Senator Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.). ""For two decades, renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have saved consumers money, supported Nebraska agriculture, cleaned our environment, and unleashed American energy.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has created incredible new opportunities for our farmers. I've seen firsthand the important markets it creates for our corn and soybean growers, and the cost savings it brings for folks at the pump,"" said Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.). ""As we celebrate this important anniversary, I remain committed to championing renewable fuels every single day and pushing for policies like nationwide, year-round E15.""

""A strong Renewable Fuel Standard is vital to a vibrant agricultural economy and the success of Iowa biofuels,"" said Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa). ""For twenty years, this American energy initiative has supported Iowa farmers, biofuels producers, and our rural communities by ensuring that Iowa ethanol, biodiesel, and other advanced biofuels are blended into our nation's fuel supply. The RFS also helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil, lowers gas prices for families, and incentivizes rural energy production. Representing hardworking farmers and biofuels producers, I will always advocate for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard that invests in rural Iowa, supports the production of homegrown Iowa biofuels, and stands with our farmers and agricultural communities.""

""For two decades, the Renewable Fuel Standard has provided long-term market certainty and predictability for American biofuels producers, fuel retailers, farmers, and other market participants,"" said Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa). ""It's incredible to see how far we've come in blending more homegrown biofuels into our nation's fuel supply—and how the RFS supports Iowa farmers and rural communities. Biofuels play a crucial role in our energy strategy to bolster energy independence and lower costs for consumers. I look forward to continuing my work with the Trump Administration and my colleagues in Congress to expand the use of biofuels as part of an all-of-the-above and all-of-the-below energy strategy.""

""I'm proud to support access to new markets for our nation's farmers that strengthens our domestic energy resources,"" said Rep. Max Miller (R-Ohio). ""Investing in American biofuels strengthens our energy supply, creates good-paying jobs, and drives economic growth in communities that feed and fuel our nation. By advancing biofuel innovation we're building a more secure, independent, and prosperous future for the American people. As we mark 20 years of the Renewable Fuel Standard, we recognize one of the most impactful commitments our nation has made to energy security and rural prosperity.""

""For 20 years, the Renewable Fuel Standard has been a cornerstone of our nation's energy policy—strengthening rural economies, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and creating new markets for our family farmers,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.). ""In Illinois and across the Midwest, biofuels mean good-paying jobs, cleaner air, and opportunity. As we look ahead, we must ensure the RFS translates to affordable low-carbon options for consumers while supporting industry growth domestically. I'll continue fighting to make sure biofuels remain a key part of America's energy future.""

According to the filings on the EPA website, the 60 recipients of the funding have targeted deployments in low-income and tribal communities across the country, through both community schemes and direct support for solar development.

Of these recipients, 49 of them are state-level, often state energy departments and system operators, as well as six tribal organisations and five multi-state programmes.

Now, the EPA plans to repeal the funding threaten the ability of low-income households to access solar PV, which can reduce energy bills and pollution in local communities.

Terminating the grants could be illegal, according to Kyle Wallace, VP of public policy and government affairs at PosiGen, a solar provider to low- and moderate-income households.

“If the EPA moves forward with the illegal termination of the Solar for All grants, it will be yet another short-sighted and harmful decision that will hurt families across the country who are struggling with rising energy costs and would have benefited from these programs,” Wallace posted to LinkedIn earlier this week.

Zeldin has sought to cut the department’s funding for solar before. In February, he called for the recall of US$20 billion of clean energy grants issued under the Biden administration, which were being held by CitiBank. Prior to this, the EPA had frozen the disbursement of Solar For All funds, at the same time as Donald Trump ordered a pause in all IRA funding following his inauguration. Those funds were unfrozen in May.

Increasing energy bills

Prior to Zeldin’s announcement yesterday, some recipients of Solar For All grants were warning of its impact on the sector.

The programme would have lowered electricity bills by 20% for around 29,000 Massachusetts residents, according to the state’s energy department.

“No one in Massachusetts voted for electric bills to go up, to kill thousands of good-paying jobs, or to make energy less reliable,” said senator Elizabeth Warren. “I fought hard for this funding—cancelling it would be reckless and further proof that the Trump administration doesn’t care about lowering costs.”

Senator Ed Markey added: “Solar for All is set to cut participating households’ average energy bills by US$400 a year, with more than US$8 billion in savings overall across all 50 states. This program should be a win for the administration—cutting it would mean stealing US$4.6 billion away from states with Republican governors or senators.”

Greater reliance on fossil fuels, which the “One, Big Beautiful Bill” supports, will likely make US energy bills more expensive. Analysis last month from Lazard shows that Solar PV and wind energy are the cheapest forms of power by levelised cost of energy (LCOE), cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel sources.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/nrel.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:06:07.227536

In other words, they are maximizing material opportunities and mitigating material risks even as their traditional governance responsibilities are unlikely to change.
Prediction: Corporate governance more critical in 2025 This prediction about corporate governance increasing in importance remains factual, but the reasons are different than anticipated.
Uncertainty around AI adoption, additional geopolitical complexity, and the impact of tariffs are the key factors driving the importance of corporate governance in mid-2025.
That said, however, other drivers are keeping corporate governance, in particular for corporate boards, elevated in importance as well.","The Thomson Reuters Institute's predictions for sustainability trends in 2025 have seen some adjustments, with companies focusing on material risks and opportunities and prioritizing corporate governance due to factors like AI adoption and geopolitical complexity, while the integration of ESG into core business strategies has not gone as mainstream as we anticipated

Key highlights:

Corporate governance has become more critical but for different reasons — The importance of corporate governance has increased significantly in 2025, driven by unexpected factors like AI adoption uncertainty, geopolitical complexity, and tariff impacts rather than just traditional ESG concerns.

ESG integration into core business strategy remains limited — The prediction that most companies would fully integrate ESG into their core business strategies proved overly optimistic, with only 21% of CFOs now saying their companies are working toward full integration.

Relying solely on non-profits and research institutions to solve the climate change problem is unrealistic — The fragmented and localized regulatory landscape necessitates increased resources from private capital and innovative business models. Large-scale impact requires building business models that can sustain and expand on these solutions.

The Thomson Reuters Institute made several predictions in early 2025 around sustainability. And while the corporate landscape in this space continues to evolve, significant adaptations in the way companies approach environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives in 2025 were initially anticipated. Early outlooks suggested an increasing importance of corporate governance and that companies were narrowing the scope of their ESG activities and giving more prioritization to embedding sustainability into their corporate business strategies.

Yet, by mid-2025, certain forecasts have altered. While companies are still moving forward with their sustainability strategies, few are taking advantage of the opportunity to use sustainability as a strategic lens for competitive advantage. In addition, many are narrowing their material impacts, risks, and opportunities to only those that are core to their business strategy and operations. In other words, they are maximizing material opportunities and mitigating material risks even as their traditional governance responsibilities are unlikely to change.

What we got right

Prediction: Material risks, opportunities & impact endure while the term “ESG” fades

The acronym ESG was always a framework to identify corporate risks and opportunities; but unfortunately, the backlash to the term has forced companies to change the language used around their sustainability strategies. This was already underway at the beginning of 2025 and is still true now.

For example, many speakers at the recent Responsible Business (RB) USA conference, sponsored by Reuters Events, highlighted their success in moving sustainability strategies forward by focusing on the material issues that can be a way to future-proof financial success. Other key takeaways included spotlighting corporate actions that are now being taken and aligning these actions with the company’s purpose.

Prediction: Corporate governance more critical in 2025

This prediction about corporate governance increasing in importance remains factual, but the reasons are different than anticipated. Uncertainty around AI adoption, additional geopolitical complexity, and the impact of tariffs are the key factors driving the importance of corporate governance in mid-2025.

That said, however, other drivers are keeping corporate governance, in particular for corporate boards, elevated in importance as well. As Helle Bank Jorgensen, CEO of Competent Boards, recently wrote: “As climate shocks intensify, artificial intelligence reshapes industries, regulations shift and stakeholder expectations evolve, directors face a new reality — that traditional oversight models are no longer sufficient.”

In addition, Jorgensen points out it’s expected by regulators, investors, and stakeholders that boards of directors will demonstrate fluency in climate and sustainability issues as they act as fiduciary stewards of companies’ strategies. She also cites more than 50 jurisdictions that have introduced requirements or expectations for directors to possess climate-related competence. This profound shift requires boards to take a much more aggressive, forward-looking orientation — one in which every operating assumption is questioned.

Prediction: Reverse of federal ESG-related regulations & rules accelerates

Six months into the year, the federal government’s efforts to roll back environmental tax credits as part of the Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 became a reality in the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Meanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted to cease defending its climate-risk disclosure rule in court in late March.

These actions show, as we predicted, that federal agencies are pulling back on ESG-related rules, especially around climate change. To fill this gap, pro-sustainability regulations and rules at the state and local levels may be needed. Gina McCarthy, a former White House climate advisor, told attendees of the recent RB USA conference that the real momentum and focus on climate needs to be on states, local governments, and communities as these local efforts are crucial and deserve international attention and investment.

Prediction: Growth in greenwashing litigation and industry collaboration continues

Our prediction about the growth in greenwashing litigation continuing into 2025 turned out to be accurate. Looking at greenwashing trends in 2025, we can see that the risk of greenwashing has never been higher because of increased complexity and the expansion of groups to include non-governmental organizations, employees, consumer class actions, and investors. Key areas under scrutiny include allegations of contaminants in consumer products, net zero statements, and forced labor in supply chains.

What we got wrong

Prediction: ESG integration into core business strategy would go mainstream

The prediction that the majority of companies would be fully integrating ESG into their core business strategy was a little aggressive, in retrospect. Indeed, omnibus proposals to simplify the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive took shape in early 2025 and derailed the accuracy of this prediction. In fact, only 21% of CFOs now say their companies are working to fully integrate sustainability into core strategy, according to a survey conducted by accounting and advisory firm BDO. However, in that survey, ESG risk was cited among the top three concerns in financial planning with 45% of CFOs ranking it among their most pressing business risks.

In mid-2025, most companies may not be embracing ESG as a strategic lens to fundamentally transform the way they operate, despite our prediction. However, companies are developing the ability to anticipate and adapt their operational strategies to uncertain futures in response to AI and geopolitical and economic instability, and for many, climate change remains a major area of risk exposure.

To underscore that point, Philippe Cousteau, Jr., CEO and co-founder of Voyacy Ventures, a blue-tech company that’s tackling the urgent global problem of coral reef ecosystem collapse and its severe consequences, told attendees of the recent RB USA conference: “It is unfair for us to expect that non-profits and research institutions can solve this problem [by themselves]. We need to develop a business model to develop this solution on a large scale.”

Cousteau’s comments ring true across the board on climate risk and other areas of sustainability risk. Private capital and large-scale corporate initiatives are necessary components for funding these solutions.",https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/posts/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/08/AdobeStock_445844535_resize.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 20:59:47.940172

He also praised the work, vision and commitment speakers and exhibitors bring to the panel sessions and sprawling expo. “Every year, we are still in awe when we walk out on the trade show floor and see the investment and the time and creativity that our exhibitors and sponsors bring to the table,” Bryan said.

John Nelson, chief operating officer with BBI International, shared that the 2025 FEW had 373 exhibiting companies and 2,490 attendees representing 45 U.S. states, eight Canadian provinces and 30 countries.

Optimizing ethanol’s growth and addressing industry constraints were the key focuses of the keynote address delivered by Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. He discussed the state of the ethanol industry under the second Trump administration and how ethanol fits into President Trump’s goal of “Unleashing American Energy.”

“If there was ever an energy sector that needs to be let off the leash and allowed to run free, it is today’s ethanol industry,” Cooper said. “For far too long, bureaucratic barriers, regulatory indecision, and policy uncertainty have been holding the U.S. ethanol industry back and preventing us from reaching our full potential.”

Cooper covered the regulatory challenges and opportunities the ethanol industry is currently facing, and he explained what needs to be done to truly unleash ethanol’s potential. The actions he presented included finalizing strong RFS volumes, passing year-round E15 legislation, prioritizing trade barrier removal, establishing a technology-neutral approach to federal policy that allows biofuels to compete with electric vehicles and clarifying the implementation of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

Trade, 45Z and E15 also dominated the conversation during the policy Q&A with Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol; Chris Bliley, senior vice president of government affairs for Growth Energy; Troy Bredenkamp, senior vice president with the Renewable Fuels Association; and moderated by Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board.

The panelists explained that the trade actions taken by the Trump administration have been mostly helpful to the American ethanol industry, particularly in addressing trade imbalances with Brazil and restrictions on fuel ethanol in India. On 45Z, Bredenkamp talked about the momentum behind the One Big Beautiful Bill Act—which was passed and signed into law three weeks after the FEW—and he explained that there hadn’t been talk of removing 45Z from the legislation, which proved to be prescient. Jennings noted that he believes there is reason for “cautious optimism” under the current administration.

The group also discussed talking points that the industry should focus on under Trump, discussing how different economic policies play better under different presidencies. Bliley recommended talking about ethanol’s consumer benefits and the way it provides jobs for small communities, and Bredenkamp advocated for emphasizing national security.

Expertise sharing was not limited to the general session at the FEW. Producers attended panels on process efficiency, technology, coproducts and more, continuing the tradition of the FEW being a hub of productive conversation and problem solving.

Building a Legacy

The 2025 FEW honored four individuals for their exceptional leadership, research, advocacy and innovation.

The ethanol industry is privileged to have numerous unassuming leaders—advocates, innovators, visionaries and trailblazers—who work with a quiet passion, never expecting praise or prize. Each June, however, the industry honors a select few of these deserving professionals with hand-crafted accolades and heartfelt gratitude at the world's largest ethanol event.

For a quarter of a century, the International Fuel Ethanol Workshop & Expo has bestowed two annual awards: the Award of Excellence and the High Octane Award. Building on that legacy, BBI International added the Women In Ethanol Award in 2023 and the Distinguished Service Award in 2024. This year, in Omaha, Nebraska, the tradition continued with four deserving professionals being honored at the FEW for their work.

Called to a Cause

Gillian Harrison, CEO of Whitefox, received this year’s Women In Ethanol Award, an accolade sponsored by CTE Global. Her journey in the biofuels industry began back in the early 2000s, when she left her successful decade-long legal career to pursue entrepreneurship with Whitefox Technologies. Longing for an opportunity to build something rather than help companies make deals and sign contracts, Harrison took the risk of starting something new. “I was prepared to take a chance to leave a very successful legal career and begin an entrepreneurial career,” she says.

Harrison believes that humanity has used its ingenuity and brilliance to accomplish amazing things and will continue to do so. As custodians of the earth for future generations, she says, we must utilize that ingenuity to avoid damaging the natural world unnecessarily. “We should be able to have a great quality of life in our generation, but not at the expense of future generations,” she says. “And I think that we have shown through the Industrial Revolution how brilliant we can be at turning different resources into the energy and the products that give us that quality of life.”

Leveraging innovation to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption drives Whitefox, so Harrison was a perfect fit there. She started at the company in 2007, serving as general counsel and head of business development for South America until she became CEO in 2009.

Reflecting on her career, Harrison identifies one moment as her proudest: signing the first U.S. ethanol producer to install Whitefox’s membrane technology. When the company first started promoting it, many producers were interested, but all wanted to “be the first to be third,” Harrison explains. After months of promotion, she met Neil Kohler at a conference in Hungary and struck up a conversation with the West Coast ethanol producer. It was a pivotal moment for Whitefox.

“[We] got to that point of the conversation where he said, ‘Well, who else is doing it?’” At that point, Harrison said, she took a breath, repeated her pitch and acknowledged that no other U.S. producers had installed the technology—yet. “And he said, ‘Well, I love being first.’ And so, I shook his hand and said, ‘You, Neil, will be first.’” Kohler’s company, Pacific Ethanol—now known as Alto Ingredients—installed Whitefox’s technology in 2016, kicking off a series of installations over the next decade that have made Whitefox and its technologies well known and respected in the industry.

Reflecting on her career in ethanol, Harrison says the most rewarding elements of her work are the friendships she’s gained throughout the industry. “I love the generosity of the ethanol industry,” she says. “People give you their time. They share their stories. They share their pains. They share what they’re looking to achieve. And I’ve developed good friendships in the ethanol industry because people do give you their time.”

Driven by Data

Steffen Mueller, principal economist with the University of Illinois at Chicago Energy Resources Center, received the 2025 Award of Excellence. Mueller’s origins in a rural community in central Germany informed his perspective on the value of biofuels production—specifically its impact on rural farming communities.

Mueller moved to the United States 30 years ago through an exchange program that allowed engineers from Germany and the U.S. to spend time working in each other’s countries. He began his career with an energy engineering firm, then attended night school to get his Ph.D. in economics. For his doctorate degree, Mueller wrote his dissertation on how energy technologies are adopted. He took on a position at the University of Illinois Chicago Energy Resources Center and became involved in the biofuels space. In 2004, Mueller visited Adkins Energy, an ethanol plant in northwest Illinois, to analyze the plant’s combined heat and power system as part of a study funded by a U.S DOE grant. His study examined the energy consumption used by ethanol facilities, proving that ethanol producers were using less energy than the current lifecycle model estimated.

“It was published in 2010, but in 2008, 2009 [and] 2010, we collected data from ethanol plants to document that their energy consumption was much more rapidly declining than previously believed, and that resulted in lower lifecycle emissions on the corn ethanol produced,” Mueller says. His work informed updates on ethanol plant energy consumption to the “Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies” (GREET) model.

That first biofuels-related study would not be the last. Mueller went on to serve on the advisory committee for California’s Low Carbon Fuels Standard, execute studies on land use change and author or co-author 40 different papers.

Biofuels constitute a unique field of study within the energy space, Mueller explains. It allows scientists to examine land-use change interactions between food, fuel, feed and biochemicals, and learn more about how we can blend ethanol to produce cleaner fuels. “My research shows that biofuels are contributing to greenhouse gas reductions and harmful aromatics reductions in our transportation fuels, and that’s sort of a big mission of mine to support,” he says.

Passionate Advocacy

Rick Schwarck, president and cofounder of Absolute Energy, was the recipient of this year’s Distinguished Service Award, which was accepted at the FEW by Tyler Schwarck. With a background in financial services, Schwarck helped found Absolute Energy in 2008 and started up the plant at a capacity of 100 MMgy. After expansion, the plant now runs at around 135 MMgy and is planned to expand up to 150 MMgy in early 2026. A native of Mitchell County, Iowa, Schwarck has spent decades investing in rural America through the ethanol facilities he has been involved with, while also being an active advocate for the industry.

Coordination and cooperation help make advocacy effective, and over the years Schwarck has helped industry trade organizations like the Renewable Fuels Association, the American Coalition for Ethanol and Growth Energy coordinate with one another. “I’m on all the boards and I kind of serve as a mediator to try bring us to together, [on] the same message as best as possible, so that when we go to … the media or government, we’re all singing from the same songbook,” he says.

Schwarck also dedicates time and energy to communicating the health benefits ethanol offers, as well as the positive impact it has had on farming communities around the world, by increasing the domestic market for American crops via the Renewable Fuel Standard. Working with the U.S. Grains Council, he has been able to promote ethanol’s benefits internationally, including the way DDGS helps address the “starch bottleneck” in the world’s food supply. Although a corn kernel only has 8% protein, once the starch in the kernel is turned into ethanol, the DDGS left over is protein-rich in comparison at around 34%. “There’s still excess starch in the world, but a need for more protein,” Schwarck says. “And so, making more ethanol will help accomplish that as well.”

Food and fuel are not the only beneficial aspects of ethanol that Schwarck has championed. Another key accomplishment of his career was assisting scientists at the Hormel Institute in gaining the funding needed to research the health impacts of Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylenes (BTEX) as a gasoline additive. The studies done by Gail Dennison, Lena Clark, Shujun Liu and others explored BTEX’s impact on lung cancer, breast cancer and other health problems. Schwarck would like to see the U.S. increase the national standard ethanol blending percentage up to an E30 blend, fully replacing BTEX.

Although he has already had a storied career in ethanol, Schwarck is not done yet. “I’ve got … a lot of things yet to accomplish. [The] past has been great, but the future is even brighter in my opinion.”

Cooperative Leadership

Michael Jerke, CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy was given the 2025 High Octane Award. An Iowa native, Jerke grew up familiar with farm work. After a summer job working at a grain elevator, Jerke decided to pursue grain marketing and management. His education at Iowa State University gave him a deeper understanding of the economics of farmer co-ops and their value to rural America. Ethanol plants have a similar positive impact on farmers, he explains.

Jerke got his start in grain elevator management for ADM but transitioned to the ethanol industry in 2001, serving in a leadership role at Quad County Corn Processors in Galva, Iowa. Over the last 24 years, he has worked in a leadership capacity at a total of five ethanol plants. Reflecting on his career, he says he’s proud that he left every ethanol facility in a better place than when he arrived. Jerke finds it “a real joy” to work with like-minded individuals in the industry who share the same drive, passion and focus.

“The through line for me is really just being very passionate about rural America and seeing the farm economy improve and seeing the way that people are really self-starters in this industry and just doing things to better their situation and the situation of the community,” Jerke says.

As an involved industry advocate, Jerke believes producers shouldn’t assume that policymakers understand the ethanol business; he says they have to continually engage with state and federal legislators to help them understand ethanol’s value. “One person can truly make an impact when they’re able to share a solid story, explain a position and then engage with people that are in [regulatory] positions [or] elected,” Jerke says.

Looking forward, Jerke is excited for what lies ahead. “I’ve never been more optimistic about the future of the ethanol industry than I am now,” he says. “I think the industry has embraced decarbonization as society as a whole is recognizing the real benefits ethanol brings to the concerns people have around carbon, climate, sustainability and energy independence.”

Motivated by the pursuit of excellence and desire to improve the lives of people and the health of the environment, each of the 2025 FEW awardees has built a legacy in relationships made, discoveries shared and innovations developed.

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are reshaping Australia’s energy landscape by enabling the integration of renewable energy across key industries including agriculture, manufacturing, data infrastructure and electric vehicles.

For more background about BESS, see our related articles.

Key takeaways

Recent patent disputes over BESS technology in Europe have highlighted the need for manufacturers of BESS to safeguard their innovations through intellectual property (IP) protection, and for project stakeholders to ensure that their contractual arrangements contain robust IP ownership and licensing provisions. In this article, we explore some key IP strategies designed to safeguard and strengthen long-term value in BESS technologies, and to mitigate the risks of IP infringement, including:

Conducting freedom to operate searches and undertaking IP due diligence to ensure IP rights are not infringed

Securing exclusive IP rights by way of design, patent and trade mark registrations

Ensuring copyright authorship and ownership claims can be established

Maintaining a competitive edge by keeping confidential information, trade secrets and proprietary ‘know how’ secure

Clearly delineating ownership and licensing rights for background and project IP developed

Obtaining IP warranties from OEMs

Managing AI use risks associated with IP ownership, inventorship and the provenance and use of data, and

Reviewing environmental claims and marketing materials that may give rise to greenwashing risks and regulatory action.

Freedom to operate clearance searches

Before investing in the development of BESS, it is critical to conduct “freedom to operate” searches to assess:

whether any third party IP rights may be infringed; and

whether design, trade mark or patent registrations can be obtained without a third party challenge.

Thorough IP due diligence should also be undertaken by project developers to minimise the risk that components supplied for installation into a BESS project do not infringe the IP rights of a third party, and that customers and end-users are not inadvertently exposed to infringement claims. This may involve reviewing OEM licensing arrangements, checking the patent landscape, verifying ownership and entitlement to use technology, and scrutinising the supply chain.

IP protection

Innovators can safeguard and commercialise their investment in the development of unique and distinctive BESS components, products, processes and brands by securing IP protection, including by way of:

Design registration to protect the unique shape and visual appearance of a product. For example, a registered design can protect the distinctive shape of a BESS unit.

Trade mark registration to protect brands, logos and distinctive slogans. There are currently 44 registered trade marks on the Australian Trade Mark Register referencing “battery energy storage” or “BESS”.

Patent registration to protect new, inventive and useful devices, methods, processes and substances. Several patents have already been registered for BESS technologies in Australia and recent data from the 2025 IP Australia Report highlights a significant rise in patent filings for electric vehicles which incorporate BESS.1

Green patent fast-tracking – Patents grant exclusive rights to make, use, sell and license an invention for up to 20 years. A standard patent registration takes between 12-18 months, however, to promote sustainable innovations, ‘green technology’ applications can be expedited, which reduces the examination timeframe to around eight weeks.

PCT International application – Australian patent registrations can be used as a basis for filing applications in other countries such as in the well-established BESS market in China and the USA2 through the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

Copyright – In addition to registrable IP rights, copyright can also support commercialisation by protecting original creative assets. While not registrable in Australia, copyright automatically protects original materials such as technical instructions, data compilations, computer software, visual system/layout designs and marketing content.

To maximise the value of these assets, manufacturers should maintain records of authorship and ownership and dated drafts/sketches demonstrating the progression of development.

Written and signed copyright assignments must be obtained from third-party consultants (such as software developers, design engineers, and prototype manufacturers) to ensure that copyright ownership is vested in the relevant entity.

IP clauses in employment contracts should be reviewed to ensure that the copyright in any original material developed by an employee in the course of their role is assigned to the relevant entity.

Securing IP rights ensures that they can be effectively licensed or transferred as part of broader commercial arrangements.

BESS contracts

IP provisions in a range of contracts will be relevant across various stages of a BESS project installation. Examples include the following:

NDAs to protect early-stage concepts, feasibility studies and proprietary modelling tools

IP ownership clauses in consultancy agreements with engineers and system designers

IP warranty, indemnity and licensing provisions in supply agreements relating to procurement of components, software and equipment, and

obligations as to how existing and newly developed project IP and proprietary trade secrets in algorithms are to be owned and used in construction, electrical installation, operation and maintenance arrangements.

At each of these contractual touchpoints, it is important to address these intellectual property considerations:

any background IP which each party brings to the project;

whether any licences will be needed between the parties;

who will own IP which is developed over the course of the project and whether that created IP will be assigned or licensed to certain parties; and

whether any warranties will be needed from suppliers confirming their ownership of IP in the technology supplied, and assuring that the installation and use of that technology does not infringe any third party IP rights.

Without clearly defined IP provisions, various stakeholders in a BESS project can potentially face disputes over ownership and exposure to infringement claims, which can significantly disrupt project delivery.

Protection of confidential information

Confidential information such as technical specifications, manufacturing/supplier arrangements, trade secrets, operational knowledge and commercially sensitive information in the nature of production costs, business strategies, customer data, financial forecasts, pricing and competitor/market analyses, is extremely valuable to a business.

Confidential information in a BESS can be protected by:

Robust confidentiality clauses in employee and manufacturer/supplier contracts that clearly define what types of information are protected, how this information must be treated and the consequences of breaching confidentiality.

IP ownership/rights/assignment clauses in supplier, distributor, manufacturer and purchaser agreements that clearly set out who owns each type of IP, what rights each party has in respect of the IP and how, when and if those IP rights can be transferred to another party.

Non-disclosure agreements that bind employees, manufacturers/suppliers and distributors against unauthorised disclosure of confidential information to third parties.

Implementing internal protocols for managing access to confidential information, including through employee training and secure storage of digital environments, access restriction and information sharing protocols.

Artificial intelligence and IP challenges

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used with BESS to optimise performance, monitor technical operations and manage resources. However, it is best practice to recognise these key AI risks:

Difficulty determining ownership over AI generated outputs used in the development of a BESS because Australian copyright and patent laws only recognises human authors and AI generated materials may not be eligible for IP protection.

Risk of IP contamination arising from outputs generated by third party open source AI vendors, where third party IP or proprietary information submitted by other users may be inadvertently reproduced in outputs leading to the infringement of third party IP.

Lack of accountability and explainability in AI generated outputs and programming where the algorithmic decision-making procedures are opaque, making it difficult to trace, explain and reproduce results and decisions made by AI.

If using AI, it is important to keep clear records of the AI inputs used in the developmental stages of a BESS. Manufacturers should also ensure that employees are adequately trained on AI use including how to protect confidential information.

Greenwashing

Greenwashing is the practice of making misleading environmental claims about a product or service and is a key enforcement priority in 2025 for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and other regulatory bodies.3 To minimise the risk of regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action regarding “green” practices, consider the following guidelines:

Plan for end-of-life management of BESS project operations, including the safe disposal of batteries and other materials which can become an environmental hazard. Developers have previously been required to provide decommissioning plans as a condition of approval for BESS projects.

Exercise caution when making environmental claims about the sustainability of your BESS product including the impact of manufacturing processes or operation of BESS products. Any claims to being “green” should be substantiated with evidence to avoid scrutiny from regulators, competitors and consumers.

What’s next?

Understanding the current IP landscape and ensuring that BESS project contracts contain robust IP and confidentiality clauses are vital steps towards protecting the technologies, data and know-how in the ever evolving BESS space.

Its adjusted EBITDA range is now $695 million-$745 million versus the initial $665million-$745 million.","The company raised its sales and earnings guidance for the year, falling in line with many other suppliers that earlier reported earnings. While automakers deal with tariff bills in the billions of dollars, suppliers are generally avoiding the hit through USMCA compliance and passing the buck to customers.

Parts makers including American Axle are seeking to benefit from increased production in the U.S. caused by import duties.

“We are receiving several inquiries from many of the global OEMs that are looking to localize production,” American Axle CEO David Dauch said. “Hopefully, we can conquest new business going forward.”

American Axle’s largest customer General Motors Co. announced in July a $4 billion plan to move production from Mexico to the U.S., including converting Orion Assembly to make gas pickups and Cadillac SUVs rather than EVs. Dauch said the move will force American Axle to shift some of its footprint, as it supplies GM in Mexico, but he expects it to benefit the supplier.

“We need to make the necessary adjustments in concert with them, and we’ll do that,” he said. “We do expect there will be some content gains … on those programs.”

American Axle took a conservative approach to investing in EV programs compared to some counterparts, which looks like a wise move as electric volumes fail to materialize and the gas engine tail grows longer under rolled back emissions rules and EV incentives. Still, the company is pursuing electrification as the segment is expected to grow, albeit more slowly than expected.

American Axle won a contract with Volkswagen-backed startup Scout Motors to supply electric units and rear e-beam axles for the Traveler SUV and Terra pickup truck, due to start production in 2027.

“Very big win for us,” Dauch said. “It sends a message to the market that we do have the ability to satisfy ICE, hybrid and electrification.”

The upbeat earnings report was welcome news for investors watching American Axle closely as it works to finalize a $1.4 billion acquisition of Dowlais Group. Dauch said the deal is on track to close later this year after winning approval last month from shareholders of each company.

The deal will create “a leading global driveline and metal forming supplier with size and scale to successfully navigate industry shifts and volatility,” Dauch said in a news release last month.

Todd Firestone, Vice President of Investor Relations, Opal Fuels: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Opal Fuel’s second quarter twenty twenty five earnings conference call. With me today are Co CEOs, Adam Kamura and John Kamura as well as Kavya San, Opal’s Chief Financial Officer. Opal Fuels released financial and operating results for the 2025 yesterday afternoon, and those results are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at upalfuels.com. The presentation and access to the webcast for this call are also available on our website.

After completion of today’s call, a replay will be available for ninety days. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that our remarks, including answers to your questions contain forward looking statements, which involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Forward looking statements are not a guarantee of performance and actual results could differ materially from what is contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described on Slides two and three of our presentation. These forward looking statements reflect our views as of the date of this call.

NOPLE Fuels does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Additionally, this call will contain a discussion of certain non GAAP measures. A definition of non GAAP measures used and a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest GAAP measure is included in the appendix of the release and presentation. Adam will begin today’s call by providing an overview of the quarter’s results and recent highlights and an update on our strategic and operational priorities. John will then give a commercial and business development update, after which Tazi will review financial results.

We’ll then open the call for questions. And now I’ll turn the call over to Adam Kamura, Co CEO of Opal Fuel.

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in Opal Fuel’s second quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. Second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our guidance for the year. We are making solid progress on building our operating platform that will support continued growth of our RNG production assets and expanding network of fueling stations. Our business continues to show solid performance, giving us confidence we will continue to see operational improvements throughout the balance of 2025. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $16,500,000 $4,600,000 lower compared to the same period last year, with this quarter’s results impacted by a lower RIN price environment, a reduction in renewable power earnings and some non recurring expenses that Qazi will discuss later.

Key highlights from this quarter include production in our RNG fuel segment of 1,200,000.0 MMBtus, which is 33% higher versus the same period last year and in line with our expectations. Our second quarter Fuel Station Services segment EBITDA was approximately $11,200,000 30% higher versus the 2024. We completed the sale of $16,700,000 of Inflation Reduction Act investment tax credits generated by the Prince William RNG facility, which contributed to cash flow and earnings. These tax credits are not included in our adjusted EBITDA. In addition to our operating results, Opal Fuels was added to the Russell two thousand, Russell two thousand Value and Russell two thousand Growth Indices.

It is worth noting that according to Bloomberg, less than 20% of the Russell two thousand companies are included in both the Growth and Value Indices, a testament to the platform and the growth we are delivering. Second quarter earnings also turned the corner for Opal producing positive earnings per share. I want to shift topics and discuss the positive movement we’ve seen in the policy environment during the second quarter with long awaited clarity and bipartisan alignment supporting RNG through constructive tax policy. The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act marks a pivotal moment for our sector with policymakers on both sides of the aisle recognizing the extensive benefits from biomethane capture and its productive use, including economic growth and energy security, while also providing improvements to local air quality and methane abatement. Chief among its provisions is the definitive extension of the 45Z production tax credit through 2029, an improvement implemented by the current Congress compared with the provisions of the earlier Inflation Reduction Act.

Although the new legislation still awaits final treasury guidance and we have not yet recognized these tax benefits in our results, we now have visibility that these production tax benefits will contribute to EBITDA for at least the next four years. Landfill RNG could receive at least $2 per MMBtu of saleable tax credits. In addition, the investment tax credit program was left largely intact and we continue to expect material ITC monetization over the next few years as new RNG projects come online. We do not yet have full clarity from the EPA with regard to its administration of the cellulosic D3 category within the renewable fuel standard or the agency’s treatment of small refinery exemptions. On the positive side, it is constructive that the EPA is now engaged on finalizing these rules and that they are showing general support of American biofuels.

Although we do not participate in the D4 and D5 liquid biofuels markets, we benefit from higher RVO mandates in these categories as they help support D3 prices. Industry is submitting their comment letters today regarding the proposed Set Rule two, and we look forward to further engagement with the EPA and discussing how RNG can promote both the EPA and the administration’s broader policy objectives. One final note on public policy is the positive impact we expect to see for our Fuel Station Services segment from the EPA’s rollback of Phase III truck regulations, which no longer force zero emission vehicles for heavy duty trucking. There has been growing consensus that alternatives to CNG and RNG, such as hydrogen and electric solutions for heavy duty transport, remain operationally and economically challenged. These developments mean more fleets are looking at CNG and RNG given it is a proven and cost effective alternative to diesel.

Opel is allocating more capital to grow our Fuel Station Services segment, which produces strong, predictable cash flow with low correlation to environmental credit prices. With policy clarity, Opel, as one of the largest owners and fastest growing operators of CNG and RNG fueling stations in The United States is well positioned to lead in this market. Despite a lower RIN price environment compared to last year, we expect to deliver operating and financial results in line with our guidance. We have momentum and we will continue executing on our growth plan with financial discipline. With that, I’ll turn it over to John.

John?

John Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Thank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. This was another quarter of disciplined execution for us at Opel. Our team made operational progress and we are seeing consistent and more importantly, scalable results from the platform that we are building. It is confirming that our business model that integrates RNG production with marketing and distribution through fueling stations is paying off. As Adam mentioned, we produced over 1,200,000.0 MMBtu of RNG in second quarter, a 33% increase year over year.

These gains were driven by the continued ramp up of our Sapphire And Pulp facilities, which came online in late twenty twenty four and improved uptime across the base portfolio. As we discussed on our last call, we are seeing improvement in operating performance. Recent months have shown upward momentum and that performance is giving us confidence in achieving full year production results within the lower end of our guidance range. The Atlantic RNG project, which represents 330,000.00 MMBtu of annual design capacity has begun commissioning and is expected to enter full commercial operations shortly. We are pleased with the execution on this project and expect production contribution in the fourth quarter.

The next wave of in construction projects, Burlington and Cottonwood are expected to come online in 2026 and Kirby thereafter in 2027, together adding an additional 1,800,000.0 MMBtu of annual design capacity. In addition to our in construction projects, our development pipeline has numerous near term opportunities with secured gas rights and we are maintaining our guidance to place 2,000,000 MMBtu into construction in 2025. We follow a rigorous capital allocation framework that includes managing our capital resources, liquidity and financing arrangements. Within this framework, we are developing a number of investment opportunities that meet these criteria. On the downstream side, our fuel station services business continues to perform well.

In the second quarter, segment EBITDA increased 30% compared to last year. Although the first half of this year presented some macro headwinds for new CNG and RNG adoption by logistics and transportation firms from tariffs, from equipment availability and pricing, and from EPA policy uncertainty. We are now seeing all three moving in a positive direction. We are on track to meet our guidance for this segment. We have 45 stations under construction today, 20 of which infrastructure allows us to not only participate in long term recurring dispensing economics, but also to earn a solid rate of return on the infrastructure that is uncorrelated to environmental credit prices.

To facilitate and accommodate our growing operating platform, we continue to invest responsibly in our people, systems, and advocacy efforts. We believe these investments and expenses will enhance long term earnings power and create shareholder value. I’ll now turn the call over to Qazi to discuss the quarter’s financial performance. Qazi?

Kavya San, Chief Financial Officer, Opal Fuels: Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone joining today’s call. Last night, we issued our earnings press release outlining our results for the second quarter ended 06/30/2025. We also concurrently filed our Form 10 Q and posted an updated investor presentation on our website. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter were $80,500,000 and $16,500,000 respectively, compared to $71,000,000 and 21,100,000.0 in the same period last year. Net income was $7,600,000 up from $1,900,000 in Q2 twenty twenty four.

This year over year quarterly growth in revenue reflects the continued ramp up of RNG production at facilities commissioned in 2024 and continuing growth in our fuel station services segment. Included in these results is Opel’s share of adjusted EBITDA from equity method investments, which was $6,100,000 for the quarter versus $6,700,000 in Q2 twenty twenty four. While we continue to see growth in most financial parameters, our adjusted EBITDA is lower year over year. Primary drivers are lower RIN prices this year, with a realized price of $2.5 versus $3.13 last year, and the loss of ISCC carbon credits in our renewable power segment. As a reminder, this credit expired in November 2024, and as such, the year over year impact will continue through end of this year.

Our second quarter results are also lower sequentially due to increased non recurring new project operating expense and non recurring G and A supporting our investments in advocacy and technology for our operating platform. Our income statement also includes a non recurring G and A expense of $2,000,000 related to a contract restructuring, which is added back in adjusted EBITDA. The other increase in G and A this quarter reflects targeted upfront investments and expenses in strong advocacy efforts, in addition to strengthening our operational and financial foundation. A key part of strengthening our operational and financial foundation is the improvement in our internal control environment to meet all SOX criteria by 2026. It requires an upfront and non recurring end to end redesign of our financial processes, implementation of a robust control environment, and the deployment of tools that can scale with our business.

These investments will not only enable a sustainable governance structure to support our today’s complexity, it will also allow for greater scale and long term cost savings. Now let’s turn to our capital expenditure for the quarter, which totaled $16,400,000 including $7,300,000 related to our equity investments. As of June 30, our total liquidity was $203,200,000 which includes $29,300,000 of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments, 138,400,000.0 of undrawn availability under our term credit facility and $35,500,000 of remaining capacity under our revolver. In June, we monetized approximately $17,000,000 in investment tax credits and still expect roughly $50,000,000 in gross ITC sales in 2025, which bolsters our operating cash flow. We believe our current liquidity position combined with operating cash flows is sufficient to fund our existing construction projects and anticipated funding needs.

As Adam mentioned, in spite of lower RIN prices, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be within the range of our guidance. We are planning an Investor Day and engage with the investor community later this year. We will discuss our long term business outlook and our ability to generate sustainable discretionary free cash flow during that meeting. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to John for closing remarks.

John Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: In closing, we remain well positioned for continued disciplined execution of our strategic growth objectives and the expansion of Opel’s vertically integrated platform. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to the operator for Q and A. Thank you all for your interest in Opel Fuels.

Conference Operator: Our first question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Texas Capital. Your line is open.

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: Good morning, guys, and thanks for your time this morning. Good morning, Derek. Good morning. One of our biggest takeaways from your and clean releases yesterday was really the strength of your dispensing business. Perhaps for Adam, could you speak to how the competitive landscape has changed in recent quarters on the downstream side and the demand you’re seeing from customers for conversions from fossil to RNG now that EV and hydrogen options are seemingly being pushed to the right?

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yeah, thanks for the question, Derek. I would say that given some of those recent policy changes and what we’re seeing from equipment pricing and equipment availability, there has been a market shift where really a lot of the large major national fleets are really engaging on CNG and RNG. And I think when those large fleets are looking around to who can really support a successful deployment and really rely on dependable supply of RNG. There aren’t too many that have really executed on it. And I think Opel Fuels is in a really good position given our success and track record that we’ve had in this space working with these major national fleets.

So I would say, there have been earlier in the year some macro headwinds around whether it be where tariffs were playing out and where freight rates have been and that sort of thing, which may have slowed a little bit people’s thinking on deploying RNG and CNG. We are seeing some of that abate, and we’re really front and center for national fleet deployments. So we’re really enthusiastic about what the prospects look to be for this as a good cost effective and proven technology versus diesel. And although you have also seen some folks on the margin that maybe are no longer being forced to focus as much on sustainability, There are still a number of significant fleets that still have sustainability targets and we feel good about where we sit and where the industry is headed from that perspective.

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: Great, Adam. And just to clarify, I mean, this point, you guys really haven’t seen any pull through on the X15 inside. Is that fair?

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: I would say this. In general, trucking and logistics firms are a little bit slower moving than we would all like. And in terms of pull through, are we seeing those trucks being deployed on the road today? Not as quickly as we would like. And at the same time, the funnel of business development activity, we’re really pleased with.

So we think there’s a bright outlook for it. And again, you still had it’s relatively not that long ago that we had that Phase three EPA truck clarity. And it wasn’t that long ago that we had additional equipment being provided into the marketplace. So, no, it’s not in our results yet today. And at the same time, we’re feeling better about all those engagements and where it’s going to shake out for 2026 and beyond.

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: That’s great. And perhaps for John, my other big takeaway from your release was the reiterated guidance despite R and G production being a little weaker than consensus had expected for the quarter. Could you perhaps speak to exit rates for the quarter or just maybe qualify or give some character to how much of your construction projects today or how they’re progressing and like what percent of completion they are?

John Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Sure. Thanks, Derek. We remain really optimistic about our portfolio of projects in construction. The Atlantic project is in advanced stages commissioning right now, and we expect that to come online shortly. And that will add to our overall nameplate capacity and operation during the year and meaningfully contribute to the fourth quarter.

We have the Burlington and Cottonwood projects on track for next year and they’re advanced enough into construction that we have good confidence on the timing of those projects as well. I mentioned that the Kirby project is in 2027. That project was originally scheduled for the 2026. The project is located in Northern California where permitting is a little bit difficult. And when a project is on the front end of the construction timeframe, sometimes that permitting timeline can affect the overall project timeframe.

In addition, the project is a little longer timeframe of construction than our other projects because of both being in California and being a bit more complicated than some of our other projects. So, generally speaking, when we look at our total portfolio of projects in operation and construction, we’re seeing that 9,100,000.0 MMBtu in operation at the end of this year, 10.2 at the end of next year, and then with Kirby and others coming online, more than 10.9 in the following year. So really on track on the execution of that growth and looking forward to putting additional projects into construction as well during the course of the year. We’re on track with our guidance in line with our guidance of $2,000,000 and we expect based on projects that we’ve announced before that are in development with signed gas rights that we should meet that and proceed with those growth plans that we expect.

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: Thanks, John. It’s great color. I’ll turn it back to the operator.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Pfingst with B. Riley. Your line is open.

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.

Kavya San, Chief Financial Officer, Opal Fuels: So as mentioned,

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: you’ve been able to maintain your guidance despite the weaker RIN price environment. Could you just give some more detail around what the main drivers are that have allowed you to keep guidance unchanged?

Kavya San, Chief Financial Officer, Opal Fuels: Hi, Ryan. Thanks for the question. There are a couple of areas that we see we would be able to continue to maintain our guidance. Part of the issue part of the drivers are, if you remember, we do have some for purchases of the RINs for sales of the RINs that allows us to have a little bit of confidence in terms of our achievement of revenue. The second area that I see is our production, the way the production is trending.

If we can keep it towards the lower end of our guidance, I think we will be able to hit that. The third major area is, even if you see the quarter has a one time non recurring G and A expenses and investments, those will normalize for the rest of the year. In addition to them, so these are generally and including our RNG project. The other major contributor would be our downstream business, our constructions and both in our self FBA stations as well as construction for third parties, it has got lumpiness. And those lumpiness has shown up hardly in the lack of it during Q2, which are picking up pretty strongly in Q3 and Q4.

So these are the few areas that gives us enough confidence that we will be within that range.

Derek Whitfield, Analyst, Texas Capital: Thanks, guys. I appreciate that color. And then for my second question, can you just talk about the landscape for M and A and how you’re thinking about potential acquisition opportunities today?

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yeah, this is Adam here. We’re still in a fragmented industry and it’s clear that we’re building a scalable operating platform, both in our people and technological platform, and our vertical integration also allows for really interesting opportunities on both upstream and downstream. So we do see that there is opportunities for consolidation in the sector. And we always look at what’s going to maximize shareholder value. Some of that comes down to what are the best allocation for those resources in order to do it.

Is it investing in new projects? Is it looking at some of those M and A opportunities? It wouldn’t surprise us if there is further consolidation in the industry. And I’ll leave it at that for now.

Ryan Pfingst, Analyst, B. Riley: Yes, fair enough. Thanks, Adam. I’ll turn it back.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice and Company. Your line is open.

Martin Malloy, Analyst, Johnson Rice and Company: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I want to kind of follow on the last question and ask about returning capital to shareholders. And I realize you just talked about having an Investor Day towards the end of the year. So if you want to tell me, just hold on that I get it.

But any thoughts on timing of returning capital to shareholders? Would it ever make sense to ratchet back maybe on CapEx spending and institute a dividend?

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yeah, Marty, this is Adam here again. And I want to impress upon everybody that we are here to maximize shareholder value. And we are really disciplined in looking at how to allocate what is liquidity and discretionary free cash flow available. We do have a robust set of project opportunities, which even given where RIN prices are today and still affording attractive spreads between our cost of capital and investing that capital. But we’re always flexible in our thinking on what we think is going to drive and maximize shareholder value.

So I would say let’s hold off a little bit until Investor Day and we give a little bit more thought and share our thoughts around discretionary free cash flow and what to do it and what the optionality is. The nice thing about our business and our business platform is we’re going to have that optionality. And we always think that we are going to be creative and proactive in how we use that discretionary free cash flow to maximize shareholder value. So the nice thing about our business again is that when you’re doing that when you built that platform, do not require CapEx to produce our fuel in the future, we are going to have options on what to do with that discretionary free cash flow, whether it be M and A opportunities, returning cash to shareholders or investing in new greenfield projects.

Martin Malloy, Analyst, Johnson Rice and Company: Thank you. I’ll turn it back.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Kubes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Ryan Pfingst, Analyst, B. Riley: Hi, good morning. Nice to see the 30 EBITDA growth in Fuel Station Services. On one hand, I think the comps get a little bit harder from here. On the other hand, it sounds like underlying policy and macro environment is becoming more supportive. Just how are you thinking about what growth can look like for that business on a more normalized basis in the medium term?

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yes. So I’m going to this is Adam again. I’m going to sort of reiterate some of the comments that Qazi said. So 2Q, a little bit light in terms of finishing out construction, and that’s just the timing of when stations are set to come online or finish out construction. So we do see a pickup in the back half from and even in Q3 from some of those activities and remain comfortable with our the guidance we provided for fuel station services for the year.

And as we get into the so that’s what I’m going to consider the medium term outlook, the next two quarters, given how investors think of things. But in reality, we’ll talk a little bit more about 2026 and beyond sort of later in the year and as we provide guidance for 2026 and beyond.

Ryan Pfingst, Analyst, B. Riley: Great. And then I think in May, you announced JV landfill gas project with RSG in North Carolina. I may have missed it, but I don’t think I heard or saw an update. How should we be thinking about timing and your share of MMBtu on that project?

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yeah. No, I appreciate you raising that one. We’re really excited about that project with Republic at the CMS Landfill in North Carolina. We are just finalizing and finishing our development around that, where it’s going lay out on the site and that sort of thing. So you are correct, you didn’t miss anything yet in terms of announcing formal construction start.

But that one as well as some other gas rights we secured earlier in the year with our partner GFL for four sites. We have a number of projects that are we’re currently in the final stages of development and that sort of thing. And it’s those and a couple of other projects that give us confidence that we do have a number of projects that can meet our 2,000,000 MMBtu target of construction starts for the year.

Ryan Pfingst, Analyst, B. Riley: Terrific. And then last one for me. Can you just update us on returns on perspective landfill gas projects marking to market for the current D3 RIN pricing? And you spoke to this a little bit earlier, but just how you’re thinking about balancing potential to invest in new projects versus sort of letting the strong underlying free cash flow conversion machine of these projects start to flow through the financials?

Kavya San, Chief Financial Officer, Opal Fuels: Thanks a lot. That’s a good question. And I would put it this way. The risk adjusted return is very important for us. So far, as Adam said, in terms of the potential capital allocations, whether we are thinking about the CMS project or the other gas rights we secured in the past, including other opportunities set with us, we have in front of us, we are evaluating on the basis of risk adjusted RIN price outlook.

We are not looking at on a rearview mirror with a very high RIN price and our evaluation and final investment decision will be on the basis of the practically pragmatically expected RIN price over the horizon of the project. So we will rest assured that we are not going to give our green light or build any of our assets with a optimistic forecast. So it’s very important. That’s why we are looking at the capital allocation between both RNG projects as well as the downstream business where we’re looking at potential opportunities in owning infrastructures, where I can we can earn risk adjusted return, which are not tied to the environmental credits market. So managing and deriving some level of portfolio stability on the long term for the entirety of the portfolio.

So in both cases, we are looking at risk adjusted return and uncorrelated revenue and bottom line pattern.

Ryan Pfingst, Analyst, B. Riley: Great. Thanks so much.

Conference Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Betty Zhang with Scotiabank. Your line is open.

Adam Kubes, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the previous question, maybe a similar in in a similar vein, how are you thinking about balancing, investment and growth between the upstream RNG production and the downstream fuel distribution? Are you looking to grow RNG supply or is it more about building out more RNG distribution?

Kavya San, Chief Financial Officer, Opal Fuels: Another very good question. So we are actually looking at it in two different perspective. One, the opportunity sets in both upstream and downstream, how each of those opportunity in of itself give us what kind of risk adjusted return. The second criteria we’re looking at is, when I’m combining these two, to what extent each one of those are enhancing the value for the others, as well as bringing the stability to the portfolio in the longer term. So these are the criteria we’re going to have to maintain as we green light, whether they invest in new RNG facilities or and investing in the downstream.

So both has to be fulfilled both criteria has to be fulfilled for us to move forward in investing in this area. As Adam mentioned, that is where ultimately we’ll decide if we have the opportunity set for us to be able to continue to invest, to improve the shareholder value or we’ll give the money back to the shareholders in some other form.

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yes. And I just yes, this is Adam. I just want to follow-up on that. We believe we’ve got a number of larger projects within our development pipeline, which will meet the investment criteria on a standalone basis. And at the same time, we really like the Fuel Station Services business and continue to allocate more capital to it.

And quite frankly, even if we were to invest more in the downstream development excuse me, in the downstream fuel station network, you’ve always got the ability to also participate in RNG dispensing economics. So we’re looking at both a little bit independently, find that we’ve got really good opportunities on both sides and recognize the synergies when you’re doing them both at the same time.

Adam Kubes, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: That makes sense. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about voluntary markets. Just curious what you’re seeing there. If you could provide an update, that would be helpful.

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: Yeah, it’s been a little quiet on voluntary markets is how I would describe it. There are a couple of state level programs that are thinking about pushing it through. I know New York is thinking about one. And again, we’re trying to maximize the value of the molecules that we produce. And that continues to be in the transportation fuel market.

It really drove what our business strategy has been in terms of integrating the upstream and the downstream to be able to have off take into that most valuable market. That being said, we are agnostic to whether or not the fixed price voluntary markets will be at a level enough to what we think makes sense for us to contract in those markets. We’ve said time and time again, we thought it was a little bit of mispriced regulatory risk between the discount and the fixed price voluntary markets and what we’re able to achieve in transportation fuel that may change over time. The other voluntary market that we’re waiting to open up would be export markets over to Europe and that sort of thing, which is still challenged with Pathways. So for now, it’s been a little quiet on voluntary fixed price market from our perspective, but we are, as we always like to say, flexible in our thinking, and should that make sense, we’ll evaluate those as they materialize.

Adam Kubes, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Very helpful. Thank you.

Conference Operator: Thank you. I’m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Adam Kamura for closing remarks.

Adam Kamura, Co-CEO, Opal Fuels: All right. We appreciate everybody’s interest in Opal Fuels and hope everybody has a great rest of the day and great rest of their summer.

Conference Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Financial Institutions Are Important for the Success of the Energy Transition

On the Resources Radio podcast, Heather Zichal discusses her career in climate policy and highlights the important role of financial institutions in advancing the energy transition. Zichal—who has developed climate policy from positions in the US Congress, the executive branch, and nonprofits—now serves as the global head of sustainability at JPMorganChase. She explains how financial institutions support decarbonization through green finance commitments, facilitating the sustainability goals of their clients, and investing in emerging technologies. Zichal underscores the importance of promoting climate solutions that balance environmental and business priorities.

How Have Environmental Review Processes Impacted Renewable Energy Projects?

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 established a mandatory process of environmental review for major projects funded by federal agencies, including highway construction, oil and gas drilling, and solar and wind energy development. NEPA often is identified as a major obstacle to renewable energy projects when the review process itself creates delays or approval of the project is challenged in court. In two related reports, RFF Visiting Fellow Arthur G. Fraas, Research Associate Emily Joiner, and collaborators examine whether environmental court challenges or the NEPA process significantly delay renewable energy projects. The authors show that court challenges delay the operational status of wind and solar projects, but renewable projects complete the NEPA process in less time, on average, than other federal projects.

Repeal of Power Plant Pollution Standards Fails Benefit-Cost Analysis

In June this year, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a repeal of existing carbon pollution standards for fossil fuel power plants. EPA argued that the repeal would reduce energy costs and help meet rising electricity demand by allowing power plants to increase their output. However, the repeal likely will increase greenhouse gas emissions and may impose other hidden costs in the United States and abroad. In a new issue brief, RFF Senior Fellow Karen Palmer and Research Associate Nicholas Roy analyze the economic costs of increased greenhouse gas emissions and complete a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the impact of the repeal on climate change, household energy costs, and healthcare costs. If EPA conducted a cost-benefit analysis with up-to-date projections and tax credits, then “the repeal of carbon pollution standards would fail traditional cost-benefit tests even without consideration of greenhouse gas emissions,” say Palmer and Roy.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2558860361_16x9.width-600.png,N,,2025-08-08 13:06:34.219743

Sept. 9 public hearing in Grand Rapids is your chance to weigh in on state’s assumptions for long-term plans for electric utility reliability and affordability, incorporating the new clean energy standard and factoring in renewable energy goals, environmental compliance, electric vehicles, potential data centers and more

Want to have your voice heard when it comes to Michigan’s energy future? The Michigan Public Service Commission will hold a public hearing Sept. 9 in Grand Rapids to hear from the community about how certain factors should be included in the state’s electric utilities’ long-range plans for producing electricity to meet customer energy needs.

The public hearing will be 6-7:30 p.m. Sept. 9 at the Eberhard Center, 301 W. Fulton Street in Grand Rapids. The hearing will be in-person, and anyone may attend and provide their thoughts on how different electricity generating technologies should be analyzed to ensure utilities can meet their customers’ electricity needs in the long term.

Officially called Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) planning parameters, these guidelines establish what Michigan’s electric utilities must consider in their required long-term modeling of future electricity demand, essentially a roadmap for ensuring they’ll have enough electricity over a period of up to 20 years to meet residential and business customer demand, while meeting clean energy standards.

IRPs address a range of issues, including the planned retirement of current electricity generation resources, the planned or anticipated need for new power generation, the appropriate mix of different electricity generation technologies to meet customer needs, laws and regulations, the timing for building or acquiring those new resources. An IRP can also address programs that impact utility customer pocketbooks in other ways, such as home or business energy efficiency efforts that can reduce utility bills and programs to address utility affordability.

IRP planning parameters answer important issues like:

How much electricity will be needed by electric vehicles in the state.

How much electricity will be needed for homes and other buildings that may switch to electricity for space and water heating.

What is the expected cost for natural gas used to fuel power plants.

How utilities will meet environmental standards and renewable goals and clean energy standards.

How adoption of rooftop solar and other distributed generation technologies will impact electricity demand.

IRPs are required under Public Act 341 of 2016, which directs all rate-regulated utilities to submit IRPs to the MPSC for review and approval. Public Act 235 of 2023 directs the incorporation of Michigan’s clean energy standard in IRPs.

Anyone needing an accommodation to attend the meeting or to inquire about accessibility may call 517-282-8090.

The Trump administration will review and may revise the country’s climate science reports, according to the US energy secretary.

Speaking to CNN’s The Source, Chris Wright said the National Climate Assessments have been taken down from government websites “because we’re reviewing them.”

“We will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those,” he added.

Mandated by Congress, the National Climate Assessments have been issued five times since 2000. Compiled by hundreds of volunteer scientists and subjected to extensive peer review, the federal reports outline how climate change has impacted each US region to date and present the latest scientific projections.

Wright claimed the earlier reports were politically biased, saying they “are not fair assessments of the data,"" adding that past climate change assessments, including the 2018 report from President Donald Trump’s first term, were not “a reasonable representation of broad climate science.”

His remarks followed the Trump administration’s April decision to dismiss over 400 experts who had begun work on the sixth National Climate Assessment, scheduled for release in late 2027 or early 2028.

The move is the latest in the Trump administration’s push to downplay climate science, as it has recently promoted fossil fuel production while cutting funding and incentives for renewable energy.

The Energy Department recently posted a coal image on X with the caption: “She’s an icon, she’s a legend, and she is the moment.”

Trump has consistently denied the existence of global warming, calling it a hoax, and has shut down programs to track climate change and scrubbed any mention of it from government documents, including webpages.

Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and one of the authors of the assessment due in 2028, slammed the move in a Thursday statement, saying: “Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears – that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it.”",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/08/08/thumbs_b_c_04c62e2be246098e779c903d785c4497.jpg?v=184227,N,,2025-08-08 13:06:42.552465

This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The United States is home to millions of small businesses that form the backbone of countless communities. Even during the best of times keeping shops solvent can be a struggle, but when climate-driven disasters strike, the impact on mom-and-pops can be particularly devastating—and prolonged.

“The news coverage has definitely focused on the physical destruction,” said Kyle McCurry. He is the director of public relations for Explore Asheville, an organization that promotes the North Carolina city, which Hurricane Helene pummeled with torrential rain and flooding last fall. “But sometimes what’s less visible is the economic impact on small businesses in our community over time.”

Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, or ice storms, small businesses are more vulnerable to climate shocks than larger businesses, said Shehryar Nabi, a senior research associate at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program. He co-wrote a recent report outlining the hurdles small businesses face from severe weather. They can be hobbled by a range of challenges, from limited preparation resources to a lack of post-disaster financing.

“One reason we focused on small businesses here is because of their importance to the US economy,” said Nabi. That was certainly the case in Asheville, a city known for its artists, breweries, and boutiques. Helene not only destroyed homes and upended lives, it sent the region’s economy into a tailspin.

In 2023, McCurry said, visitors to the area spent $2.9 billion. Last year, Helene hit Appalachia right before the busy fall foliage season, when tourists flock to places like Asheville to see the leaves turn. McMurry says the storm, which knocked out some municipal services for weeks, led to a 20 percent to 40 percent drop in annual business revenue.

Ten months later, a slew of businesses haven’t reopened: Vivian’s restaurant, Pleb Urban Winery, and TRVE Brewery, to name a few. Another was New Origin Brewery, which started pouring in 2021 and soon had fans lauding it as their favorite brewery in Asheville. Although the floodwaters inundated the business, the bulk of the destruction occurred when railroad cars floated off nearby tracks and crashed into the building.

“There’s not a way to get money for damages in that scenario,” said Dan Juhnke, one of New Origin’s founders. Even after maxing out the brewery’s flood insurance claim, it wasn’t enough to cover the damage. The only other option was to take on more debt from the federal Small Business Administration, or SBA, which didn’t seem prudent. Ultimately, Juhnke and his business partner decided to apply for a Federal Emergency Management Agency-funded buyout program that purchases flood-damaged property and limits rebuilding as a way to mitigate the damage from future storms.

“We signed up for it and have been waiting almost a year now,” said Juhnke.

McCurry estimated that, overall, around 85 percent of Asheville businesses have reopened in some form, which is relatively good news. According to 2014 national data from FEMA and the Department of Labor, 40 percent of small businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster and another 25 percent shutter within a year.

These waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term. While FEMA has individual and public assistance programs, there is little if any funding for businesses. The SBA often offers low-interest loans, but the paperwork can be burdensome and the money might not start arriving for months.

Only 14 percent of businesses were able to rely on support from the federal government, according to an analysis of the 2021 Small Business Credit Survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “Support makes a meaningful difference,” said Nabi. “For a lot of businesses it is the difference between closing down and surviving, but it doesn’t reach all the businesses that could benefit.”

State and local governments, private lenders, and community fundraising are other potential sources of money. New Origin, for example, raised more than $100,000 via a GoFundMe campaign but fell short of its $300,000 goal. A fund that Explore Asheville established has brought in $2.1 million, which has been awarded to more than 500 businesses.

Still, Nabi said, these avenues don’t usually address one of the toughest challenges facing businesses after a storm: liquidity. Even a month or two of disrupted cash flow can devastate some operations, which is why experts point to pre-disaster planning as one of the most effective steps a business can take to help protect itself.

“Often businesses see contingency planning as a distraction from the core thing they want to do,” said Benjamin Collier, an associate professor in the Department of Risk and Insurance at the Wisconsin School of Business. But things like better understanding your insurance coverage, or where to move inventory in the event of a threat, should be routine steps for business owners and generally aren’t expensive.

“The natural tendency for many small business owners [is] to be reluctant to really engage with the risks that they’re exposed to,” he said. “This is a call to have more buffers and be more cautious.”

Nabi also underlined the importance of planning, but says structural change could help as well. Greater use of parametric insurance, which automatically pays out when a specific event like a disaster happens, would allow quicker access to funds. Shifting more money to pre-disaster preparation could help businesses avoid the worst impacts of a storm, too. “The financing for preparation is limited compared to what’s available post-disaster,” said Nabi.

Pat Nye is the regional director for the Los Angeles Small Business Development Network. Earlier this year the counties he oversees saw historically devastating wildfires, and one thing that he noticed was that unlike with residential properties, insurance companies hadn’t offered small businesses discounts for any improvements they might have made to make their buildings more fire-resilient.

“As it stands, there is no incentive that exists for this work,” said Nye. “A lot of stuff just focuses on homeowners.”

Governments often don’t do enough to include small businesses in their recovery plans either, contends Kristen Fanarakis, the associate director of small business policy and innovation at the nonprofit Milken Institute. She pointed to a landscaper in the Asheville area who spent weeks helping clear debris after Helene without pay and ended up facing eviction. Those are the kind of businesses, she said, that municipalities should be hiring and including in rebuilding efforts.

More broadly, a report Fanarakis wrote called for a cross-agency “small business resilience czar,” standardized disaster assistance forms, and quicker grant dispersal, among other recommendations. She called the current system “very reactionary” and argues for increased attention to not just the immediate impacts of disasters but the long-term economic fallout as well.

The Permian Basin remains the largest oil-producing shale play in the US, with global demand and geopolitical shifts continuing to support growth and competitiveness in the region, according to recent research from Offshore Technology’s parent company, GlobalData.

The region’s crude oil production averaged 5.6 million barrels per day (mbbl/d) during the first quarter of 2024 (Q1 2024), accruing benefits from a dense pipeline network and Gulf Coast infrastructure.

GlobalData oil and gas analyst Ravindra Puranik said: “Europe’s strategic shift away from Russian energy exports has resulted in key changes to the global energy supplies. This is anticipated to benefit the US shale oil and gas drillers, as well as LNG [liquefied natural gas] producers who are positioned to reap from these evolving supply chain dynamics.”

With this revolution in hydrocarbons, the US has been the world’s biggest producer (as well as a substantial importer) for almost a decade, now extracting well over 13mbbl/d of crude oil.

How will it maintain that position and what longer-term strategic issues does the country face? Mason Hamilton, vice-president of economics and research at the American Petroleum Institute (API), shares his insights with Offshore Technology.

Ed Pearcey (EP): How has the US overtaken nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world’s largest oil and gas producer?

Mason Hamilton (MH): This has been decades in the making. This goes back to the start of fracking technology, which was pioneered in the early 1950s by the US Department of Energy. Then, there was horizontal drilling technology. Those two were separate technologies and had separate pathways.

In the past 20 years, those two technologies have been combined to give us a revolution and unlock a lot more of the resources already underneath our feet.

Gas exports, particularly to Europe, have gone up quite substantially over the past five years. Collectively, Europe is the top destination for our LNG exports, particularly Germany, [which] has turned away from Russian gas. [The volume of US LNG exports to Germany reached 28.17 billion cubic feet in April, up from zero in 2022].

I believe in Q1 2025, [the US] also set a record high in the amount of LNG exports to places other than Europe, such as Asia and South America.

EP: Are there any areas in the US that are primed for exploitation?

MH: With acquiring resources, three main questions crop up: what’s the available resource out there? Is there access to it? And, at what price can we get it?

Alaska has a lot of potential. We saw the Willow project [an oil drilling initiative on the plain of the North Slope of Alaska in the state’s National Petroleum Reserve, situated entirely on wetlands] with ConocoPhillips not too long ago. That was a big development there.

There is also a lot of activity going on in federal lands. One of the of underlying themes that people are not aware of is that, since 2019, it is actually New Mexico that has seen the largest oil and gas production growth, not Texas. A huge chunk of the New Mexico production comes from federal lands in just three different counties.

In fact, there is one county in the south-eastern corner of New Mexico, Lea County, that produces more crude oil than the five smallest OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries] members. It produces over a million barrels a day. That growth was driven by access to and use of federal lands.

If you look at the trends since the pandemic, the driving force that was really apparent post-Covid is increasing hydrocarbons production on federal lands. So, I would definitely say federal lands can be exploited further, because that is seen in the data.

EP: Is the US nearing full energy independence? Doesn’t the US still import certain types of crude oil?

MH: Under Biden, there was a period of confusion and contention for us. Not only do we need continued certainty on access, but it is written into the law – that both onshore and offshore quarterly or yearly lease sales must be held – but in some years, they [the Biden administration] just didn’t do it.

We need to be clear – the term ‘energy independence’ is more or less a political slogan. From my perspective, the US is an active importer and exporter of energy, and an active trading partner when it comes to energy resources, whether that is electrons, petroleum, coal or so on.

I think the terms ‘energy security’ and ‘energy independence’ are being used interchangeably. What we are really talking about is increased imports. I think between six and seven million barrels a day [we import], and I think 70% of that comes from Canada, while the second-largest imports origin point is Mexico.

It is not like US is going far afield to get access to imported barrels – they are coming from North America. The marginal barrel, yes, probably does come from the Middle East, but far less than it did in the early 2000s or the 1980s or even 1970s, when we saw big gas lines during the energy crisis.

In terms of energy security, yes, we are probably more energy secure now than in the past, but the term energy independence is just confusing – a misnomer.

EP: Is there enough refinery capacity in the US? It needs to build more infrastructure such as refineries and storage facilities, so is that being worked on?

MH: The US has not built any new major transportation, fuel-producing refineries since the late 1970s – but despite that, and despite many refineries closing over the past 30 years, the US has more refining capacity today than it did in the 1980s.

That is because the refineries that we do have left have been heavily invested in, modernised and are equipped with the latest technology, meaning we can squeeze out every extra molecule. The US refinery fleet is one of the most modern in the world. Only last year, China managed to reach the same amount of refining capacity that we currently operate.

The refining crown of the world is currently split between the US and China. China may have slightly more capacity, but US refineries run at a higher utilisation rate, typically in the 80% range, and sometimes even 90%. China simply does not achieve those kinds of run rates.

The question of whether we need more refining capacity is not the right one. It should be ‘Are we maximising the existing kit in the fleet that we have available?’

I would flag one issue: we are losing refineries on the West Coast of the US, particularly in California, because of a very harsh regulatory environment, a harsh market environment, and other economic challenges such as refineries consuming a lot of electricity at a time when electricity prices in California are very high.

With refinery closures in California, that market has become tight to the point where all of a sudden they must call up somewhere far, far away to get replacement supplies of gasoline.

Could we build another refinery? Well, that depends on where it is, as the US is not one unified market for petroleum products, but five separate regions, namely the East Coast, Midwest, Gulf Coast, Rocky Mountain and West Coast.

Nobody, as far as I know, is proposing a new greenfield refinery, but more refineries are being invested in, expanded upon and improved constantly.

However, building a new refinery poses another question: do you build a refinery next to the source of demand, or do you build it next to the source of supply?

EP: Are there any other markets, apart from Europe, to whom the US is looking to export its hydrocarbons?

MH: It really depends on the product you are talking about. For LNG, Europe is a wide-open market. Increasingly, natural gas is going towards Europe.

Then there are places such as India and South East Asia that are of interest. Some countries in South East Asia are on the cusp of needing to import energy rather than export, as their economies are growing, and their traditional fossil fuel resources and reserves have been depleted.

Countries that come to mind are Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. They have significant energy resources; their production is now maybe on a downturn, but they have vibrant economies and still need power.

Closer to home, South America is always a big market for us. In terms of Central and South America, a large portion of US petroleum product exports such as transportation fuels, gasoline and diesel go to Central and South American countries. In fact, over 50% of US gasoline exports go to one country: Mexico.

Diesel is the most diverse US export product across all the energy commodities, because it goes to a long list of countries. So yes, the US is always looking to develop new markets in different places.",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/07/shutterstock_2154875237_Novikov-Aleksey_via_Shutterstock-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 14:03:14.681659

RICHFIELD — A nonprofit water utility corporation based in Richfield has been awarded nearly $5 million in state funding for a major infrastructure upgrade.

Gov. Josh Stein and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) recently announced that the Pfeiffer–North Stanly Water Association will receive $4.9 million in Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to support its North Main Street and Old U.S. 52 waterline replacement project.

By upgrading these lines, it will modernize aging water infrastructure and ensure safe drinking water for residents in northern Stanly County. The project will help reduce the risk of service disruptions and improve overall system efficiency, while also strengthening the utility’s ability to meet public health and environmental standards.

Incorporated in 1964, the Pfeiffer–North Stanly Water Association has effectively operated as a rural water utility provider as it delivers water purchased from the City of Albemarle to its member areas through its own distribution network.

“When you turn on the faucet in your home, you shouldn’t have to worry about whether that water is safe for your family,” Stein stated in a DEQ press release on July 23. “These investments will help ensure North Carolinians have access to clean drinking water and will help keep people safe when disaster strikes.”

Collectively, the funding awards are designed to improve drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, identify and replace lead pipes, improve resiliency after future storms, and to address perfluoroalkyl, polyfluoroalkyl and other forever chemicals.

“At DEQ, we’re committed to ensuring everyone in North Carolina has access to clean water,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson added. “This funding will address aging infrastructure and improve public health for communities large and small.”

The DEQ reviewed 133 eligible applications requesting a combined $1.57 billion.

That’s despite tariffs and the fact that the company is bringing LFP battery production to the U.S.

The American automaker will eventually fit U.S.-made batteries in the Bolt, but not at first.

The 2027 Chevrolet Bolt electric car, which is expected to become one of the most affordable EVs in the United States, will be powered by lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries sourced from outside North America, according to a Wall Street Journal report that was confirmed by General Motors.

GM will buy batteries from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology, better known as CATL, for the first two years of the new Bolt’s production as a stopgap before American production of LFP batteries can pick up the pace and replace the Chinese imports.

The 2027 Chevy Bolt will feature a Tesla-style charging port.

“For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing,” a GM spokesman said in a statement for The Wall Street Journal. “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model.”

Currently, all of GM’s electric models, from the entry-level Chevy Equinox EV to the ultra-luxurious Cadillac Celestiq, are fitted with U.S.-made batteries. As a result, the revamped Chevy Bolt, a fan favorite which will become the automaker’s cheapest EV, will be the only GM-made electric car to be powered by imported batteries.

Moreover, this will likely make a dent in GM’s money-making plans, as Chinese-made batteries carry import tariffs of about 80%. The decision would have also made the new Bolt ineligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, but that’s a non-issue now that the incentive will end on September 30.

The 2027 Chevrolet Bolt is expected to be a heavily revised version of the previous-generation Bolt EUV model that was retired at the end of 2023. It will go into production late this year at GM’s Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, with deliveries set to begin next year as a 2027 model with an estimated price tag of under $30,000.

At the same time, the American automaker is working with LG Energy Solution to bring its LFP battery factory in Tennessee online by the end of 2027. With this timeline, it would have been impossible to launch the new Bolt with American-made batteries, so GM found a way to get around that, albeit with heavy levies attached. Still, the company is confident it can turn a profit. ""It's going to be at a similar price point to the old one going out, which is very low,"" GM President Mark Reuss told InsideEVs in Detroit last year. ""We're going to deliver it at a profitable point.""

Late last month, the carmaker teased the upcoming affordable EV, revealing that it will feature a Tesla-style NACS charging port and LED lighting front and rear.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9meL0G/s1/2027-chevrolet-bolt-ev-to-be-powered-by-catl-lfp-batteries.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 12:11:44.048503

The scientists, responsible for authoring or contributing research to hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, want to counter what they interpret as the Trump administration’s attempts to wipe credible, widely accepted climate science off the record.
“Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,” NAS president Marcia McNutt said in a statement.
Several climate scientists whose research was cited in the Trump report said it misused or misrepresented their work.
“It’s giving me flashbacks to 2005, when such false debates raged.” Cobb said she hopes to help “set the record straight” on climate science in their response to the DOE report.","Dozens of veteran climate scientists are launching a coordinated response to a Trump administration report that casts doubt on the severity of climate change. The report, released last week alongside proposals to deregulate some polluting sectors, was authored by five researchers well-known for sowing doubt over the impacts Americans are feeling from the climate crisis.

The scientists, responsible for authoring or contributing research to hundreds of peer-reviewed studies, want to counter what they interpret as the Trump administration’s attempts to wipe credible, widely accepted climate science off the record.

In addition to the report, which the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency are using as evidence to weaken pollution rules, the administration has removed all congressionally mandated climate assessments from federal websites. Energy Sec. Chris Wright said the administration is changing those previously published assessments before they put them back on the web, CNN reported.

The scientists are planning to author a public comment on the Energy Department’s report released last week, according to Andy Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University, who is organizing the response.

“We want to get all the science into the public record, so that any debate over this will have access to solid science,” Dessler told CNN.

In addition to the self-organized efforts by mainstream climate scientists, the National Academy of Sciences announced Thursday it is launching a comprehensive review of climate science findings since 2009 — the year the endangerment finding was issued, which concluded climate pollution was endangering public health and welfare. The fast-track review, which the academy says will be self-funded, is set to be completed by September.

“Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,” NAS president Marcia McNutt said in a statement. “We are undertaking this fresh examination of the latest climate science in order to provide the most up-to-date assessment to policymakers and the public.”

In stark contrast to the National Climate Assessments, which take years to research with multiple rounds of peer review, the five-person Trump report took just two months to research and write, with no peer review. Several climate scientists whose research was cited in the Trump report said it misused or misrepresented their work.

Dessler said scientists are going through the report “section by section” to address all “the mistakes (and) the things they left out.”

“There are a lot of things in there that fall into both those categories,” he added. “It is not a valid representation of the science of climate change, and we want to make that clear.”

One federal climate scientist, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the media, told CNN the notion that the DOE report is an assessment or comprehensive review of climate science is “nonsensical on its face.” The scientist pointed to the lack of peer review, paucity of the report’s authors and rushed timeframe, among other reasons.

“It’s just garbage,” the scientist said, referring to the reigniting of the “false debate” over whether climate change is caused by humans and threatens lives and livelihoods. “It’s like somebody took all the bullshit from 10 years ago, didn’t refrigerate it and has now regurgitated it.”

Kim Cobb, who directs the Institute at Brown University for Environment and Society and is part of the group working to respond to the DOE report, told CNN it’s significant that the Trump administration is deep-sixing the climate assessments at the same time it’s releasing a misleading new report.

“The fact that this administration has buried the gold standard for climate science — the National Climate Assessments — while lifting up a report filled with misrepresentations and half-truths is a grim historical marker,” she said in an email. “It’s giving me flashbacks to 2005, when such false debates raged.”

Cobb said she hopes to help “set the record straight” on climate science in their response to the DOE report. She intends to speak at the public hearing on the repeal of the endangerment finding, a 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has underpinned many of the federal government’s biggest pollution regulations.

Wright told CNN he hand-picked the four researchers and one economist who authored the Trump administration report: John Christy and Roy Spencer, both research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, Georgia Tech professor emeritus Judith Curry and Canadian economist Ross McKitrick.

“I just made a list of who do I think are the true, honest scientists,” Wright said. “I made a list of about a dozen of them that I thought were very senior and very well respected. I called the top five, and everyone said yes.”

Zeke Hausfather is one of the scientists whose work was misrepresented in the DOE report and is the climate research lead at financial services company Stripe. Hausfather also helped author the Fifth National Climate Assessment.

Hausfather told CNN he “wasn’t that surprised” that his research was included, because it has focused on how climate modeling can be improved.

“The problem with the way both the EPA and DOE report used my findings is they left out the context of how the community has adapted and evolved” on modeling, Hausfather said.

In arguing for the endangerment finding to be overturned, the Trump EPA highlighted how the direst climate scenarios are getting less likely; therefore, the US government doesn’t need continue to adhere to the endangerment finding — a bit of circular reasoning these scientists are particularly frustrated about.

It’s as if the Trump administration is saying, “We’re heading towards a slightly less dire future in terms of emissions, so we can roll back existing climate policy,” Hausfather said.

The worst-case scenarios, like the planet warming to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, are looking less likely precisely because nations are cutting their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions and moving to clean tech like wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles.

That doesn’t mean the planet is out of the woods.

“A 3-degree world by 2100 is going to be a world with huge climate damages,” Hausfather said.

Wright called the critiques about the DOE report misusing others’ research an “unfair assessment.”

“I don’t know that particular author, but if some data set is taken from some author and his conclusions are different from the data set, well, that’s the process of science,” Wright said. “It’ll be improved as we get feedback and comments from others, and we’ll continue to elaborate on it.”

Dessler, the climate scientist leading the response to the DOE report, said the science community is angry about their work being deleted and twisted to fit the Trump administration’s narratives promoting fossil fuels and downplaying the severity of climate change.

“People are really mad,” Dessler said. “We’ve devoted our lives to doing good science, and bad science is offensive. They’re not raising interesting questions and they’re not identifying things that scientists have overlooked; much of it is already debunked.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2160618137.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-08 13:07:58.122736

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI.
The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

The move is part of President Trump's effort to reverse former President Biden's climate agenda and boost fossil fuels instead.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills. Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.

Now, the fate of the program is in question, the Trump administration argues, because of a massive spending and tax bill Republicans passed last month.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country. Also, rooftop and community solar can help households avoid power shutoffs, which are dangerous in extreme heat and cold.

The Solar for All program, and the solar projects across the country, would have meant significant greenhouse gas reductions, says Costa Samaras, director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. ""We need all the clean power we can get right now,"" he says.

The U.S. EV Market Landscape EVs still make up a small portion of overall U.S. vehicle sales.
Before the start of 2025, Cox Automotive forecast electric vehicle sales would constitute around 10% of all new cars sold.","The U.S. auto industry has leaned long and hard on federal support to make a mark in electric vehicles. But after the July 4 signing of the ""Big Beautiful"" budget into law by President Donald Trump, that support is about to come to an abrupt end. Like a fireworks show where all the rockets are set off at once, U.S. EV sales could explode in the coming weeks as buyers rush to make the tax-credit deadline. Then the fun will end and automakers will face hard decisions.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles will expire on Sept. 30. Trump's budget legislation also ends zero-emission vehicle credits, which funneled money to EV manufacturers from makers of gasoline vehicles. And it ditches fines for companies not meeting corporate average fuel economy standards.

Those policies boosted Tesla (TSLA) and EV startups and prodded auto giants such as Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) to reinvent themselves around EV-centric strategies.

Heading into 2026, uncertainty from trade war tariffs and terminated incentives cloud the EV market outlook. Analysts aren't yet offering specific forward-looking electric vehicle sales forecasts. But most believe U.S. EV demand is set to slow significantly in the coming year. Many automakers had already scaled backed U.S. EV production plans in the past year due to cooling consumer demand. Now they are set to step back even further, or shift their focus to hybrid vehicles.

That could leave the U.S. auto industry even further behind as global trends shift toward electrification. China and Europe continue to advocate for rapid EV adoption. Chinese EVs, which dominate the home market, are quickly gaining favor overseas, setting new standards for quality, technology and affordability.

Meanwhile, gasoline-electric hybrid models are attracting more U.S. buyers, largely due to lower prices, but also due to ""range anxiety"" and other consumer concerns. U.S. automakers may not entirely flee the EV market, but the going threatens to get rough in the near future.

As a result, auto stocks have been dodgy, at best. GM is flat for the year. Shares of Ford are up 13% and finding support for the moment, but are still 57% off their 2022 high. Tesla, Toyota Motor (TM) and Mercedes-Benz (MBGAF) are all down for the year.

Volkswagen (VWAGY) stock is up 17% and BYD (BYDDF), China's top automaker and EV market leader, has posted a 25% gain. But neither chart is sending positive signals. Overall, IBD's Auto Manufacturers industry group shows a year-to-date drop of 23%.

But Ford, for one, thinks consumers still want EVs. They just want them to be cheaper. CEO Jim Farley has said the company has focused significant resources on building ""a breakthrough electric vehicle and a platform in the U.S.""

Ford: The EV 'Canary In The Coal Mine'

Monday will be a crucial day for Ford's EV vision and maybe for the U.S. EV market overall.

Farley has pledged that Ford will develop affordable, mass-market EVs that will be profitable. He told analysts on the Q2 conference call that Ford will unveil its upcoming EV platforms on Aug. 11 in Kentucky.

""This is a Model T moment for us at Ford,"" Farley said, referring to Henry Ford's creation of mass production for the 1908 Model T. The innovation slashed the price of a car by 60%. It is widely cited as the birth of the modern automotive industry.

Analysts remain doubtful. During the July 30 performance report, Ford said its electric vehicle division lost $1.33 billion in the second quarter, even as its EV revenue soared 105% vs. a year earlier to $2.4 billion.

Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas wrote on July 30 that it is ""EV decision time"" for Ford. The company appears to be a ""canary in a Kentucky Coal Mine"" when it comes to electric vehicles.

""We expect the company to put a 'brave face' on their EV strategy during a presentation on Aug. 11 in Kentucky,"" Jonas said. But ""investors remain skeptical for how Ford could operate a profitable EV business in a market where even Tesla's car business is unprofitable.""

Besides consumer preferences and the turnabout in government policy, Jonas sees another pending threat as ""Chinese EV tech migrates onto U.S. shores (slowly, at first).""

U.S. Autos Aware Of China EV Problem

Farley tipped his hat to China's EV prowess in late June when he took the stage with Walter Isaacson, the famed biographer of Elon Musk and others, at the Aspen Institute's Ideas Festival.

After a year of extensive travels to China, the Ford head acknowledged that it has ""far superior in-vehicle technology"" compared to the U.S.

""You get in, you don't have to pair your phone,"" he said. ""Automatically, your whole digital life is mirrored in the car. You have an AI companion, you can talk to ChatGPT-equivalent in China, all your automatic payment is already there, you can buy movie tickets, it has facial recognition so it knows who's in which seat and which media you like.""

Much of this connectivity is enabled by companies like Huawei, which means China's government could be riding along as well.

The U.S. Incentive Era Is Done (For Now)

China's lead is a relatively new development. Tesla in many ways continues to set the industry's EV bar. U.S. and other automakers have worked double-time to catch Musk's first-mover juggernaut, assuming that going all-in on EVs would boost stock performance.

Just five years ago, Mercedes and Volvo said they would go all-electric by 2030. General Motors has targeted 2035. Volvo had already purchased EV manufacturer Polestar in 2015.

Volkswagen (VWAGY), for its part, decided to invest $5 billion in a joint venture last year with U.S. EV startup Rivian (RIVN).

Backing those promises was a mix of subsidies and regulations from governments around the world. The U.S. jumped to the head of this booster club when then-President Joe Biden signed into law several measures to promote renewable energy and incentivize electric vehicle production. Most effective for consumers was the tax credit of up to $7,500 under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.

In addition to the IRA tax credit, the zero-emission vehicle credits and corporate average fuel economy fines also wielded clout. Tesla has long been a major beneficiary of the ZEV credits program, as well as the CAFE rules. That is because automakers that failed to meet federal emissions requirements would often purchase credits from the EV giant or another company with credits to spare.

Those programs also provided an incentive for traditional automakers to shift to EVs.

Tesla earned $2.8 billion in revenue from selling credits in 2024, 16% of its total gross profit. William Blair analysts estimate that 75% of Tesla's regulatory credit revenue has been related to the CAFE standards.

U.S. EV Sales Boom, Then Cool

U.S. EV sales raced 49% higher to a record 1.2 million in 2023. The IRA tax credit ""was really an effective tool for helping sales and price parity between EVs and ICE (internal combustion engines),"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, senior analyst at Cox Automotive, told IBD.

But sales quickly slowed to 8% growth, or 1.3 million new EVs, in 2024.

The slowdown has continued. U.S. EV sales dropped 6.3% in the second quarter. That left electric vehicle sales up just 1.5%, to 607,089, in the first half of 2025, according to Cox Automotive data. Meanwhile, China sold more than 3 million EVs in the first six months of 2025, and its exports accelerated.

Streaty said the ""year-over-year decline in Q2 was only the third decline on record."" She read that as a possible ""sign of a more mature market.""

But it also showed consumers souring on the hefty prices for EVs. And it's difficult to see the very uncertain market after tax credits expires as mature.

Electric Vehicles Shifting To 'Organic' Growth?

In the nearer term, sales for the rest of this year may be more predictable. General Motors, the No. 2 U.S. EV seller after Tesla, reported a 7% gain in second-quarter EV sales. Sales rose 12% for the first half of the year.

On Aug. 4, GM reported that its July EV sales — following Trump's budget launch — soared more than 115% year-over-year in July, to 19,000 units.

That July sales surge supports Streaty's view that the looming end of IRA tax credits could trigger ""record"" U.S. EV sales through the third quarter. That would be followed by a ""collapse"" in the fourth quarter, as ""the electric vehicle market adjusts to its new reality,"" she said.

""The second half of the year will be a critical test of EV demand,"" Streaty said.

And that's not necessarily a bad thing, says Stephanie Brinley, associate director for AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility.

Elimination of the tax credits and other incentives allows demand to ""grow a little more organically"" and be ""a little less forced,"" Brinley said.

Automakers will have to prove their marketing mettle, Streaty says. ""There are going to be some interesting things in 2026 to see how different stakeholders really react to this.""

Broadly, analysts project a marked slowdown in the nation's transition to electric mobility. The Rhodium Group estimates that Trump's budget could mean significantly fewer EVs on the road by 2035 compared to previous forecasts.

The U.S. EV Market Landscape

EVs still make up a small portion of overall U.S. vehicle sales.

Through June, the Tesla Model Y was this year's bestselling battery electric vehicle in the U.S., followed by the Tesla Model 3, according to data compiled by Morgan Stanley. The General Motors-owned Chevrolet Equinox was a distant third. The Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 rounded out the top five among BEV models.

Before the start of 2025, Cox Automotive forecast electric vehicle sales would constitute around 10% of all new cars sold. Trump's policy changes trimmed that forecast to around 8.5%. That would be little changed from 2023, when EV market share grew to 7.6% from 5.9% in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.

In China, new energy vehicle sales totaled 5.47 million in the first half of 2025. That's slightly more than 50% of all passenger vehicles sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association. NEV sales include BEVs, plug-in hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles.

The U.S. also lags the European Union. There, BEVs had 15.6% market share in the first six months of this year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. That was up from a 12.5% a year earlier.

Automakers Were Already Cutting EV Plans

Even before Trump's new budget, automobile manufacturers, other than Tesla, were taking a loss on U.S. electric vehicles. Many were scrapping or delaying EV releases. EV demand appeared to be softening or, at least, readjusting.

Ford, Mercedes, Volvo and even Apple (AAPL) all killed some electric vehicle models last year. Reports in July said Honda had scuttled its planned five- and seven-seat EV SUV, which was set to hit the road in 2026. Honda (HMC) shifted its focus to hybrid production.

Meanwhile, Nissan (NSANY) in April scrubbed future plans for EV sedans. Nissan North America Chair Christian Meunier told Automotive News the automaker was ""listening to market data,"" which showed U.S. consumers demanding fewer EVs and more SUVs.

A rise in demand for hybrid models has been key to that shift, Streaty said. ""So we'll probably start to see more of those production shifts to other alternative powertrains.""

But not exclusively. Ford says it's mostly sticking to its EV guns, targeting EV production and new affordable releases even as it delays some new EV models to 2028. Rivian plans to begin deliveries of its new R2 vehicle in the first half of 2026, with the R3 or R3X due out sometime after that.

Hyundai (HYMTF) is also significantly increasing electric vehicle production at its $7.6 billion Georgia plant, designed to produce 500,000 EVs and hybrids a year. Currently, the plant produces the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9. It is expected to expand to include other Hyundai, Kia and Genesis EV models.

Despite the anticipated hit to U. S. electric vehicle sales, Streaty does not see automakers exiting the EV segment.

""I think it's more of a timeline readjustment,"" she said, of U.S. sales growth. ""I don't think we've plateaued.""

Steep Competition In China

Halfway around the world, China's EV automakers bask in an embarrassment of state-subsidized riches.

The highly competitive marketplace is where Musk sees his EV company's top rivals. Among them are auto giant BYD (BYDDF) and newer EV market entrants like Xiaomi (XIACY), XPeng (XPEV), Li Auto (LI), Nio (NIO) and Zeekr (ZK). All these companies offer affordable or mainstream vehicles filled with technological bells and whistles.

""I think definitely we're pulling back and China is continuing to move forward,"" Streaty said. ""They've been very aggressive with subsidies and infrastructure buildout.""

While it has boosted EV adoption, that buildout has also led to overcapacity. Overcapacity, in turn, triggered a price war. The price war is pressuring margins across China's auto industry, threatening a shakeout among the weaker players.

That's one reason China is hustling to increase vehicle exports. Europe, Latin America and Australia are all targets.

China's automakers ""want to dominate this (EV) space,"" Streaty said. ""They are ahead of us and they are only going to get further ahead of us.""

Even so, Brinley does not see U.S. automakers as out of the race.

""The intellectual investment is still happening. I wouldn't say that the Western automakers can't either catch up or be competitive,"" Brinley said.

The Hunt For The 'Affordable' EV

By early this year, General Motors was backing away from its internal goal to end sales of nearly all gas-only vehicles by 2035. CEO Mary Barra stressed on the July 22 earnings call that GM now seeks the ""flexibility to shift"" between traditional internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs ""based on market demand.""

GM's Chevy Equinox EV starts around $35,000. The company is bringing back a revamped Chevy Bolt EV, likely in early 2026. GM has yet to confirm the price tag, but it's expected to be around $30,000. The bolt will feature GM's first lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack.

The focus, Barra said, is to ""get to profitability and then to continue to improve so we have appropriate and strong margins from our EVs as well.""

That would leave GM ""very well-positioned ... for later in this decade into next decade,"" Barra said.

Tesla also continues to say it will release an affordable vehicle soon, likely a cheaper Model Y variant. Executives on the July 23 earnings call, however, said deliveries won't start until at least Q4, after the $7,500 tax credit expires.

Trump Tariffs Will Make It Difficult

The actual impact of U.S. trade tariffs has yet to be determined. But as automakers struggle to develop and launch cheaper EVs, it seems clear that tariff policies will increase production costs. Ford expects a $2 billion tariff impact this year while Trump tariffs hit General Motors to the tune of $1.1 billion in the second quarter alone.

Since April, when Trump's initial tariffs for imported autos were set at 25%, the import tax has been lowered for many countries.

A trade deal reached with the U.K. subjects vehicle imports to a 10% tariff. Meanwhile, in recent weeks 15% automobile import tariffs have been imposed on Japan, South Korea and the European Union.

How To Read Stock Charts

However, U.S. auto manufacturers still grapple with 25% tariffs on vehicles built in Canada and Mexico, as well as 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. As of publication, U.S. tariff negotiations are ongoing with Canada and Mexico, two major automobile manufacturing hubs. And of course, Trump and China also continue to go back and forth.

Streaty noted that tariff headwinds have dragged down 2025 total U.S. auto sales forecasts. Sales now are expected to fall in the second half of the year but to what extent is still unclear.

""We have yet to really see any tariff impact on prices, but that potentially could happen later in the year when new models come in,"" the Cox Automotive analyst said. ""More to come on that.""

On Aug. 5, Cox Automotive ventured a prediction that, due to Trump's tariff policies, U.S. consumers will see vehicle prices climb by 4% to 8% by the end of 2025, with price increases accelerating as 2026 model-year vehicles hit the market.

With Trump's tariffs, though, an affordable EV is likely to be even more expensive to manufacture, and not just because of levies on imported metals and parts. China is a major autos parts supplier and in response to the U.S. trade war has begun restricting exports to the U.S. of rare earth metals and other key components for EV batteries and motors, markets it dominates.

When biographer Isaacson asked Farley during the Aspen festival whether his company can compete with China on EV prices, the Ford CEO stuck to his script.

""The key,"" Farley responded, ""is innovation.""

This milestone, highlighted in the Environmental Defense Fund's newsletter, is detailed in a new report by the International Energy Agency. The IEA's World Energy Investment 2025 outlook reveals that solar, wind, battery storage, and electric vehicles are seeing booming investment globally.

Despite ongoing opposition to green climate policy from U.S. conservative leaders, clean energy is charging ahead. According to the IEA, clean technology will account for two-thirds of total energy investment worldwide in 2025, up from 40% in 2020.

Much of this momentum is driven by China, the European Union, and emerging economies like India and Brazil, but the U.S. still plays a crucial role, with $400 billion in clean energy investments outstripping the $187 billion put into fossil fuels.

The investment surge could lead to cheaper energy bills, more local clean energy jobs, and cleaner air. And it is already working: the IEA reported that the cost of solar panels has fallen by 30% over the past two years alone.

Significant infrastructure upgrades, expanded battery storage, and smarter electric grids are facilitating the transition to cleaner energy, helping protect communities from rising energy costs and worsening pollution.

This shift toward renewables is expected to prevent billions of tons of heat-trapping pollution and reduce the risk of oil and gas price shocks.

The clean energy boom was first covered in the EDF's Vital Signs newsletter, which shares inspiring good news stories on environmental solutions, clean tech breakthroughs, and actions individuals can take.

Many online were relieved with the optimistic outlook.

""This is great news,"" one Reddit commenter in r/energy said.

""If Trump wants energy dominance, maybe we should be investing in the sectors that are growing?"" another asked. ""Seems like basic common sense.""

This follows many recent clean energy advancements in the U.S., from investments in EV charging technology to community-focused solar and nuclear fusion.

Everyday people are beginning to see the benefits and are switching to options like home solar through companies like EnergySage, which offers a free service to compare quotes and save up to $10,000 on solar installation that could bring your energy costs toward $0.

The consortium also plans to improve the model by merging it with Watershed’s Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive.
In reality, many goods are sourced from other countries where economic activity often produces far more emissions, research has found.","The Environmental Protection Agency said it would stop updating research that hundreds of companies use to calculate their greenhouse gas emissions after the agency suspended the database’s creator because he had signed a letter criticizing the Trump administration’s approach to scientific research.

The researcher, Wesley Ingwersen, is leaving the E.P.A. to pursue his work at Stanford University. He was one of 139 E.P.A. employees suspended and investigated by the agency after signing the June letter, which charged that Mr. Trump’s policies “undermine the E.P.A. mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Dr. Ingwersen led work on a statistical model that combines environmental and economic data to calculate the carbon footprints — what experts refer to as emissions factors — of a range of goods and services, from making steel to flying planes to growing apples. The open-source data sets help companies understand the greenhouse gases generated by each step in their supply chains.

The database is the third most viewed of more than 281,000 federal data sets on Data.gov, the government’s public data repository. An earlier version of the database is among the top 10 most viewed. The data sets will remain publicly available but will not be updated to reflect the current state of the economy, rendering them less useful over time.

Damien Lieber, a senior manager at ENGIE Impact, an environmental consulting firm, described the E.P.A.’s decision to stop supporting the research as “a major setback for corporate climate action and reporting.” He called it “one of the most important data sets available — if not the most important — for estimating value chain emissions.”

Many companies account for their supply chain emissions to comply with regulations in the European Union and in California, which is set to begin requiring companies to report supply chain emissions in 2027. Other companies use the data to identify and cut back on the parts of their operations that cause the most pollution.

Dr. Ingwersen’s model, known as U.S. Environmentally-Extended Input-Output, or USEEIO, is popular because it integrates with spending data that companies already have, said Kristine Parisi, a senior economic consultant who manages carbon accounting at FTI Consulting. A furniture company, for instance, can tally how much it spent on wood, textiles, metal, shipping and office supplies and use Dr. Ingwersen’s model to quickly estimate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with those activities.

“It’s a very great, very granular, very highly reviewed data set,” Ms. Parisi said.

In a July 24 email sent by the E.P.A. to users of the database and obtained by The New York Times, the agency announced it would stop supporting Dr. Ingwersen’s research. “E.P.A. has decided to end future development of USEEIO by the close of Fiscal Year 2025 (September 30),” the email said, adding, “We wish to thank Dr. Ingwersen for his dedication and determination through the years in bringing the concept of USEEIO as a freely available tool to life and wish him success in his future endeavors as he leaves the Agency.”

Asked on Thursday about the cancellation of the program, Brigit Hirsch, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, initially denied that the E.P.A. was discontinuing work on the database.

Later, she wrote that the email announcing the program’s end, which was signed by the USEEIO team, was “not discussed with E.P.A. leadership.” She added that “E.P.A. leadership is discussing the further development needs and ability to continue to support USEEIO.”

In early July, the E.P.A. suspended Dr. Ingwersen, who had spent 15 years at the agency, after he signed an open letter organized by Stand Up for Science, a group that planned a March rally in Washington to protest the Trump administration’s cuts to federally funded scientific research.

Dr. Ingwersen’s work will continue under a consortium called Cornerstone that includes Stanford and two private companies, Watershed and ERG.

Michael Steffen, the head of climate analytics at Watershed, an environmental analytics company, said the consortium shows how public research projects can continue after losing government support.

“There will be many instances where private actors, research universities, companies want to step in and maintain continuity on similar types of research,” Mr. Steffen said. “They have done so with prior changes in government support. This is a great example of that.”

But Paul Anastas, who served as the E.P.A.’s assistant administrator for research and development from 2009 to 2012, cautioned that shifting government research to the private sector could undermine its credibility.

“Throughout our history, the most reliable data has come from the public sector, whether it is on food safety, health, economics or the environment,” Dr. Anastas said. “Moving data to the private sector with private motivations such as profit, power, market share or competitive advantage makes the data less trustworthy and therefore less valuable.”

Other E.P.A. research projects could struggle to find private backing, either because they rely on confidential data, are too costly or have no immediate commercial application.

Ms. Hirsch, the E.P.A. spokeswoman, said the agency “has the resources needed to accomplish the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, fulfill all statutory obligations and make the best-informed decisions based on the gold standard of science.”

Cornerstone has pledged to keep Dr. Ingwersen’s model and the data sets of emissions factors free and publicly available. The consortium also plans to improve the model by merging it with Watershed’s Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive.

That work will also address a shortcoming of the data set: the assumption that companies’ supply chains are entirely contained within the United States.

30%: Why GM And BMW Are Buying More Chinese EV Batteries

2026 Chevy Bolt Teaser

General Motors and BMW likely would have used U.S.-made batteries for their upcoming EVs if the federal credits weren’t ending years ahead of schedule.

The $7,500 consumer tax credit helped buyers offset the high cost of EVs, which primarily comes from batteries, while automakers worked to bring more production stateside and localize the supply chain.

Then the U.S. government flipped the kill switch on clean energy programs. Now, GM and BMW are falling back on China’s expertise in battery manufacturing.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that GM will purchase lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from CATL, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, for the next-generation Chevy Bolt EV.

Yes, they will face tariffs of about 80%, but CATL’s scale and expertise means they might still make economic sense for GM.

GM’s primary battery supplier, Korea’s LG Energy Solution (LGES), will start converting its battery plant in Tennessee for local LFP production at the end of this year. The conversion won’t be complete until the end of 2027.

The Bolt EV will have to be powered by CATL’s LFP batteries until the LGES plant can get up on its feet.

2026 BMW iX3 Prototype Drive

BMW is in a similar situation. Its battery supplier Automotive Envision Supply Corporation—a Japanese battery maker with several plants in China—paused the construction on two plants early this year due to “policy and market uncertainty.”

AESC’s South Carolina factory was supposed to supply cells to BMW’s own battery assembly plant in Woodruff, SC.

Automotive News reported on Thursday that AESC will now import batteries made in its plants in China, which could be cheaper to produce there despite U.S. tariffs—the company already has an established supply chain network and the required scale to make cheap batteries in China.

Regardless of where the batteries come from, EV choices for buyers are about to get a lot more exciting. GM will launch the new Chevy Bolt EV early next year. And BMW’s Neue Klasse iX3 is imminent, too. In an early prototype drive earlier this year, an iX3 prototype blew us away.

60%: Shell Will Shut Down Its Volta EV Chargers

Volta’s network of more than 2,000 EV chargers will be dismantled by the end of this year, AdExchanger reported this week. Shell had acquired Volta Charging back in 2022 and now wants to focus on high-speed public fast-charging stations with Shell branding instead, the outlet reported.

The company’s charging stalls had a unique advertising feature, thanks to an additional screen, which was part of the reason Shell acquired the company in the first place. But Volta’s $2 billion valuation cratered fast as the business model didn’t quite take off, with Shell purchasing it for just $169 million.

While the removal of 2,000 EV charging stations is bad news, the consolidation trend in the industry is hardly surprising. As InsideEVs reported in July, U.S. charging networks are still expanding, but the emphasis has shifted to fewer, larger sites equipped with higher-powered stalls and amenities like restrooms, cafes and Wi-Fi.

90%: China's EV Sales Slow Down After Govt. Acts On Price War

China is cracking down on the predatory discounts carmakers were offering on their EVs, which risked putting smaller players out of business due to unhealthy competition.

As Bloomberg reported on Friday, China’s Passenger Car Association is seeing fewer models with price cuts, which has also resulted in car sales dropping, although not at an alarming rate.

Car sales grew about 6.3% in July in China, slower than the 15% rate that’s typically seen around this time of the year, PCA said.

Top government officials in China convened a meeting with the country’s biggest EV makers urging them to self-regulate and stop offering unreasonable discounts.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills.
Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.
A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.
The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country.","The Trump Administration says it will end a $7 billion program to help low-income households and communities get access to affordable solar energy. The move is part of President Trump's effort to reverse former President Biden's climate agenda and boost fossil fuels instead.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills. Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.

Now, the fate of the program is in question, the Trump administration argues, because of a massive spending and tax bill Republicans passed last month.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

The EPA under Biden had estimated that the program would produce over $350 million in annual savings on electric bills for low-income households across the country. Also, rooftop and community solar can help households avoid power shutoffs, which are dangerous in extreme heat and cold.

The Solar for All program, and the solar projects across the country, would have meant significant greenhouse gas reductions, says Costa Samaras, director of the Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University. ""We need all the clean power we can get right now,"" he says.

Ford's EV unit reported significant losses, prompting a shift in strategy to compete with Chinese automakers.

An upcoming announcement is teased as a ""Model T moment"" for the company's EV future.

Ford Motor Co. is extending its delay in launching two next-generation electric vehicles as the Dearborn-based automaker continues its focus on smaller and more affordable models that deliver profits, the company said.

Ford informed suppliers and employees in June that a full-size electric pickup, which is to be the successor to the F-150 Lightning, will be delayed to 2028, a company spokesman told the Detroit Free Press on Aug. 8. That's a delay of a few months longer than the initial delay set for late 2027. Prototypes for that vehicle will still launch in 2027. Ford plans to make that vehicle at its BlueOval City Assembly Plant in Tennessee.

Additionally, Ford is delaying production of its E-transit van, to be built at its Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, from 2026 to 2028.

“F-150 Lightning, America’s best-selling electric truck, and E-Transit continue to meet today’s customer needs,"" Ford spokesman Ian Thibodeau said in a statement. ""We remain focused on delivering our Ford+ plan and will be nimble in adjusting our product launch timing to meet market needs and customer demand while targeting improved profitability.”

This is not the first time Ford has shifted its EV strategy, and it won't be the last. Ford's EV lineup consists of the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit EV. The company is expected to make a big announcement on Aug. 11 at its plant in Louisville, Kentucky, outlining a future EV strategy. CEO Jim Farley has teased the announcement as being ""a Model T moment"" for the company, a reference to Ford's historic early car that helped build the 120-year company into a mass-market carmaker.

Ford, which leads the industry in recalls, has yet to make money on its EV sales. In fact, Ford has projected it will lose up to $5.5 billion in its EV and software operations for 2025. In the second quarter, Ford reported its Model e electric vehicle unit lost $1.3 billion in the quarter, a wider loss than the $1.1 billion it lost in the year-ago period.

Farley has said Ford needs to look at the Chinese car companies as its main competitors going forward in the EV space. As the Free Press reported in June, Farley and Ford's executive leadership team went to China earlier this year with an agenda: to study every aspect of how Chinese auto companies operate, then apply those lessons across Ford in its other markets.

That's because Chinese automakers have been driving down costs on EV production, selling high-quality, well-designed EVs at affordable prices in Europe and Asia. Ford and other automakers are now focused on also producing lower-cost, smaller EV models using cheaper-to-make batteries that sit on a streamlined platform.

Automotive News was first to report the extension of the delays. The Detroit Free Press first reported Ford's initial move to delay the EV launches in August 2024. Ford said at that time that it is changing its EV strategy, canceling plans for an all-electric three-row SUV and delaying the launch of a full-size EV pickup.

At that time Ford said it was making those changes so that it could prioritize the introduction of a new, all-electric commercial van in 2026 (now delayed to 2028). Then, a more affordable mid-sized EV pickup and the full-size pickup would launch in 2027 — an initial delay of about 18 months from the original plans.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/10/PDTF/84539945007-img-ford-headquartersjp-1-1-ck-17-fk-96-d-l-2255513185.JPG?crop=833,470,x0,y12&width=833&height=470&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-08 12:11:52.174976

Despite the ongoing tariff turmoil and the forthcoming loss of the federal tax credit, the automaker is still determined to blow past Tesla for the #1 crown. In the latest news, GM plans to import low cost LFP batteries from the well known Chinese firm CATL over the next two years, pending the rampup of a domestic source. Wait, don’t they know EV sales are going to crash?

EV Sales Will Not Crash, Part I

To be clear, there is plenty of damage yet to be done to the vehicle electrification movement in the US before President Trump and his anti-EV agenda leave office as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes. If a sharp downturn in EV sales does happen over the coming years, Republican representatives in Congress can also take much of the credit. They kneecapped the existing $7,500 federal EV tax credit last month when they passed the new “OBBA” tax bill. Under the new schedule, the credit will end on September 30.

Still, EV sales will not screech to a sudden halt. They will continue at some level or other. Federal tax law is an important stimulus, but the US market has long been characterized by a majority-male, relatively well-heeled clientele that can afford to pass on a one-time tax credit and reap the unique benefits of zero emission mobility for years to come.

On top of reduced maintenance and fuel costs, there’s the convenience of fueling up at home or work, the security of emergency backup power with bi-directional charging technology, and the opportunity to benefit from rooftop solar panels, home energy storage, utility demand-response programs, and other related technologies.

EV Sales Will Not Crash, Part II

The charging station situation is also rapidly evolving to embrace a new EV-purchasing demographic. The vast majority of drivers prefer to recharge at home, but millions of potential buyers live in multi-household properties without charging stations. The solution has finally begun to emerge in the form of Charging-as-a-Service business models that do all the heavy lifting for property owners and residents, including planning, permits, installation, operation, and maintenance.

Another bottleneck has been gumming up the works on the grid side, in areas where a wobbly infrastructure can’t support fast charging technology. That roadblock is also evaporating with the help of drop-in charging stations. Equipped with their own energy storage feature, these chargers deliver a fast charge to EV drivers in a hurry, while the storage system recharges itself from the existing grid at a slow pace when conditions are optimal.

As for affordability, that’s where the new GM-CATL hookup comes in. CATL produces LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) EV batteries overseas, which means they are subject to whatever new tariffs the President feels like announcing at the moment. However, GM is eager to keep its EV sales record hopping, and is willing to weather the tariff storm over the next couple of years until the company can ramp its LFP operation in the US up to speed.

New Low-Cost LFP Batteries From CATL

The new GM-CATL hookup was reported yesterday by multiple news organizations, with The Wall Street Journal reportedly getting the scoop and Reuters following up, among others.

“General Motors will import electric vehicle batteries from Chinese battery giant CATL. The arrangement is a stopgap for GM in the next couple of years as it works to manufacture its own lower-cost batteries made with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry,” Reuters reporter Nora Eckert reported.

Eckert cited a GM statement confirming the plans. “For several years, other U.S. automakers have depended on foreign suppliers for LFP battery sourcing and licensing. To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model,” the statement read.

“The Detroit automaker added that it sells 12 EVs in the United States with domestically-produced battery cells, and in 2027 will bring LFP production to the U.S.,” Eckert added.

EV Sales & The Return Of The Chevy Bolt

By “our most affordable EV model,” GM means the on-again, off-again Chevy Bolt. The popular EV first launched into production in 2017, with GM billing it as “the first long-range, mass-produced EV available to customers at a truly affordable price.”

Despite the enthusiasm, GM halted production in 2023 in favor of turning its attention to bigger, more expensive EVs. That made sense in the pro-electrification days of the Biden administration, when the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 stimulated high end EV sales with a new $7,500 tax credit.

Still, GM is among the EV makers promising to bring more affordable electric cars to the masses, and LFP technology provides a new opportunity.

On July 29 GM teased a brief sneak peak of its plans for re-launching the Bolt. “There will be updates to the front fascia and rear tail lamps, a NACS charging adapter port, and some other cool stuff that…we’ll show you later,” GM stated. That was the sum and total of the sneak peak. This week’s LFP news certainly adds more meat to the bones (see more Chevy Bolt background here).

LFP Batteries & The Affordable EV Of The Future

GM is not the only automaker to bank on LFP technology as the key to unlocking EV sales. Conventional lithium-ion batteries are still the gold standard for long range, but LFP technology can satisfy the habits of many drivers at less expense, and CATL is among the battery makers pursuing that market.

GM’s July 29 teaser for the new Bolt EV followed an earlier announcement about its LFP plans, in which the company described the transition of its existing battery factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce LFP batteries before the end of 2027.

“At GM, we’re innovating battery technology to deliver the best mix of range, performance, and affordability to our EV customers,” explained GM’s VP of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability Kurt Kelty.

“This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio,” Kelty added.

Clearly GM is in a real hurry to introduce those new LFP batteries before the upgrade is completed. With Tesla busily shredding its own EV sales record, GM and other automakers have a golden opportunity to fill the gap, tariffs and tax laws notwithstanding.

PJM Interconnection, the nonprofit that manages the country’s largest electricity grid region, is barely known by the general public and almost never mentioned by elected officials—except when something bad happens.

Well, something bad has happened. For two years in a row, PJM’s process for ensuring the grid has sufficient power plant capacity has resulted in record high prices, which will get passed on to consumers. The results are tied to rising electricity demand for data centers and a bottleneck in approving grid connections for new projects.

Almost everything about these events is bound up in layers of complexity.

To explain what’s happening, my colleague Rambo Talabong put together some charts and I spoke with energy policy experts. Together, we aim to make this situation understandable.

PJM, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, oversees the grid and electricity markets in a territory that stretches from New Jersey to Chicago. The organization has roots in a 1920s partnership between utilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

“It’s a bunch of utilities who have come together and said, ‘We can provide more reliable, less expensive electric service to customers if we work together and have a mutual aid pact,’” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has a background working in utility regulation and the energy industry. “When a customer in New Jersey can buy power from a power plant in New Jersey, or a power plant in Pennsylvania or a power plant in Ohio, it’s going to be cheaper than if they were just buying from power plants from New Jersey.”

One of the ways PJM manages its system is by holding an auction in which power plant owners compete to see who will offer the lowest prices to be available to the grid at all times.

The result is a “capacity price,” which is the price set to ensure that there are enough resources to meet the region’s needs on the hottest days of summer. The price sets the level of payments to participating power plants, which is an important income source for them in addition to what they make from selling electricity.

Here are the results of the last decade of auctions, and you can see why electricity consumers are feeling the sting.

Last year, the auction produced a result so unusual that this topic, usually reserved for the business press, became general news. The new price, which took effect two months ago, was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an increase from $28.92 per megawatt-day in the previous delivery year.

The most recent auction was last month, yielding an even higher price, $329.17 per megawatt-day. This price will take effect next June.

Since a megawatt-day (which is 24 megawatt-hours) is a unit that most people don’t use or understand, it’s easier to put these results in terms of how many billions of dollars power plant owners stand to receive in aggregate. The change from two years ago is dizzying, going from a low of $2.2 billion to the most recent result of $16.1 billion.

Governors across PJM territory have voiced their displeasure. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said, “What PJM has laid out is a slap in the face.”

Why did costs go up so much? There are many reasons, but the main one is that electricity demand is soaring, largely due to the development of data centers. The upward curve in PJM’s long-term forecast is in contrast to the prior decade-plus of flat growth.

“Supply and demand,” said Daniel Lockwood, a PJM spokesman, when asked about the reasons for rising costs. “Unprecedented and continuing growth in demand from the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.”

Silverman from Johns Hopkins agreed that this is, by far, the leading factor.

When demand is flat, old and inefficient power plants often struggle to compete, leading plant owners to close the plants that are losing money or barely profitable. Since 2000, PJM has seen a shift as coal-fired power plants reached the end of their lives and were replaced by natural gas plants and some renewables.

The retirement of old coal plants was good for the environment, but the rapid loss of those plants has helped to intensify the supply crunch that’s now happening.

But plant retirements are only part of the picture.

One of the reasons PJM is struggling to secure enough power plant capacity is the organization’s challenges in connecting new plants to the grid.

PJM has an online queue in which owners of prospective power plants get in line to gain approval to hook up to interstate power lines. Ideally, this would be a fast process, but the queue has turned into a quagmire of long waits, meaning the grid isn’t getting some of the new power plants that would otherwise be ready.

Most of the affected projects are solar arrays, the results of a solar boom across much of PJM territory.

Some caveats: Some of the projects in the queue are highly speculative and unlikely to get built, so the numbers can be misleading. Also, some projects are held back by more than just PJM, with challenges getting local permits and other factors.

As of June, there were 63 gigawatts of projects waiting in PJM’s interconnection process that should be completed by the end of 2026, according to Lockwood, the PJM spokesman. He noted that there are 46 gigawatts of projects that have agreements to plug into the grid today, but some aren’t being built because of factors beyond PJM’s control, such as siting, permitting and financing.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have said PJM often acts as an obstacle to reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

“The power grid operator’s policy decisions too often favor outdated, expensive power plants and needlessly block low-cost clean energy resources and battery projects from connecting to the grid and bringing down prices,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, in a statement. “This extended price spike was preventable.”

Here are some of the wait times broken down by technology.

So, how much is a household’s electricity bill rising because of all this?

I asked several of the largest utilities in PJM for specifics. Their answers had wide variations, which helps to show differences in rate structures, state regulations and other factors that affect how and when the PJM charges reach consumers.

PSEG, the largest utility in New Jersey, notified customers in February of an impending 17 percent rate increase that was largely due to the rise in PJM charges. As of June, a household using 650 kilowatt-hours per month now paid $183, which was $27 more than before.

ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has increased its residential bills by roughly 10 percent because of the surge in PJM charges that took effect in June. A typical household, which uses 609 kilowatt-hours per month, is paying $117, which is $11 more than before.

Dominion, which is the largest utility in Virginia and also has PJM customers in North Carolina, said its customers were largely insulated from PJM costs because the company gets most of its electricity from power plants that it owns. This is different from most large utilities in PJM, which do not directly own power plants and use market-based systems to obtain electricity for customers.

The total monthly cost for PJM capacity, even after the increase, would be less than $2 per month, according to a Dominion spokesman.

Just like PJM’s capacity prices have gone up, they can come back down. But for that to happen, some of the market fundamentals will need to change. I don’t expect that to happen any time soon.

So you’re probably going to keep hearing about PJM in the context of explanations for high electricity prices.

The Trump Administration Prepares to End ‘Solar for All’ Program: A program designed to expand access to rooftop solar may be the next federal clean energy program to face an attempt at defunding from the Trump administration, as I report for ICN. The Solar for All program had survived months of purges, so the potential cuts are especially disappointing for the people who have been setting up state and local programs that rely on the funding.

The Country’s Largest Offshore Wind Project Remains on Track: Dominion Energy says it will complete the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project by the end of 2026 and also gave updates on how the Trump administration’s tariffs will affect the costs, as Diana DiGangi reports for Utility Dive. Due to tariffs, costs will rise by $506 million, bringing the total amount to $10.9 billion, said Bob Blue, Dominion’s president, CEO and chairman. This project is proceeding toward completion despite the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind.

EV Charging Program May Survive Trump Assault: The Trump administration has run into formidable opposition to its attempt to freeze $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging stations, as David Ferris reports for Politico. In June, a judge said the federal government had to unfreeze the program’s funding. Last month, the judge allowed a group of nonprofits to join the case as intervenors, and additional states have become part of the case, including Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

The move is part of President Trump's effort to reverse former President Biden's climate agenda and boost fossil fuels instead.

The ""Solar for All"" program had aimed to help more than 900,000 low-income households reduce pollution, and utility bills. Solar for All funded efforts around the country to provide rooftop solar panels, community solar farms, and battery storage.

Now, the fate of the program is in question, the Trump administration argues, because of a massive spending and tax bill Republicans passed last month.

Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a social media post that the new law repeals ""the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including a $7 billion program called Solar for All."" Zeldin did not offer details about how and when the program would be cut back or shut down.

The Solar for All money had already been obligated to state entities like the West Virginia Office of Energy, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, and the Michigan Department of Environment. Under the program, the entities then gave grants to lending institutions that fund solar and battery projects, and to installers and project developers themselves. Some funding also went to organizations focused on expanding solar for tribal communities. And some money went through multistate solar programs like GRID Alternatives.

Because the money was considered obligated, grantees argue the Trump administration can't reclaim it now.

""We and many others are prepared to take them to court,"" says Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environment justice at Lawyers for Good Government, which is working with grantees. Blanchard says the new law ""rescinded only a much smaller portion of money — of unobligated funds.""

A key element of the Solar for All program is helping low-income households.

Having solar ""means that people can essentially have more money to pay for other essential needs, such as food and healthcare. Both of which are rising in price simultaneously,"" says Sanya Carley, professor of energy policy at the University of Pennsylvania.

""By removing this program, a program that was designed specifically to help low and moderate income households, it essentially means that these households won't be able to benefit from these reduced bills,"" Carley says.

A year ago the EPA awarded Colorado's Solar for All program $156 million. The governor's office said that would expand access to solar power to more than 20,000 Coloradans.

""The Trump Administration is seeking to rip cost-saving solutions out of the hands of hardworking Coloradans and push us backwards into an over reliance on non-renewable resources,"" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.

By the 2010s, the dynamic had flipped, and China became a major source of investment and technology for Brazil’s energy sector.
Chinese investment in Brazilian renewables started with hydropower, which still dominates Brazil’s energy mix.
But the twin goals of industrialisation and green transformation do not always align, with surging imports presenting challenges to local manufacturing hopes.
Last year, the Global South overtook the Global North as the main export market for Chinese solar panels.","The three-pointed star of Mercedes-Benz still watches over the highway in Iracemápolis, but the old German car factory beneath it has been under new ownership since 2021.

Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors (GWM), the facility’s new owner, is scheduled to begin production at the site this month. Most of GWM’s sales are still of petrol cars, but the new Iracemápolis plant will focus on hybrids, turning out the Haval H6.

The GWM factory, setting up in Brazil’s industrial heartland of São Paulo state, is just one of several recent Chinese investments in the country’s clean energy sectors that bring manufacturing onshore. Further north, in the state of Bahia, the world’s largest electric vehicle maker, BYD, has already started production of Brazil’s first domestically built battery‑electric passenger car, at a plant that was previously owned by Ford.

BYD has two other factories in Brazil: a foothold in the south-eastern city of Campinas, established in 2015, which makes electric‑bus chassis and solar‑panel modules; and a plant in Manaus, Amazonas state, that assembles lithium‑iron‑phosphate battery packs for BYD buses.

Both the GWM and BYD plants will initially assemble cars from kits imported from China, but the plan is to gradually increase the number of components manufactured in Brazil. “From next year, we will localise several items. We need to be a local company, to produce in Brazil – not just to take advantage of government incentives, but to export to the wider region,” said Ricardo Bastos, GWM Brasil’s director of institutional affairs, in an interview with Dialogue Earth.

Investments by GWM, BYD and Chinese wind turbine maker Goldwind, which purchased a former General Electric factory in 2024, align closely with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s “sustainable” reindustrialisation agenda.

“Manufacturing output is a permanent conversation in Brazil, but this government is particularly keen on pursuing industrial policies, so there is plenty of space for looking favourably at Chinese investment that goes into manufacturing,” Armando Castelar, coordinator of applied economics at the Brazilian Institute of Economics (IBRE), told Dialogue Earth.

On his state visit to Beijing in May, Lula secured several commitments by Chinese firms to invest in clean energy manufacturing, including from turbine maker Windey to build an assembly plant in Bahia. Lula also came back with a USD 1 billion commitment from Envision Energy to build a sustainable aviation fuel complex, and a plan from automaker GAC to break ground on a new EV plant in Brazil by 2026.

Energy cooperation between China and Brazil is not new. In the 1990s, China looked to Brazil for engineering know-how, with turbines for the Three Gorges Dam manufactured in São Paulo. By the 2010s, the dynamic had flipped, and China became a major source of investment and technology for Brazil’s energy sector.

China’s State Grid – the world’s largest utility company – has played a central role in developing Brazil’s electricity grid. It entered the market in 2010 and, after a series of high-value acquisitions, began competing in energy auctions. Deploying the “ultra-high voltage” transmission technology it developed to bridge vast distances in China, the firm built two lines that span the length of Brazil – and it continues to construct some of the country’s most ambitious transmission projects.

Oil has become another pillar of energy cooperation since the 2010s. In 2009, state oil company Petrobras tapped a USD 10 billion oil-for-credit line from China Development Bank, beginning a relationship that has seen China become one of Petrobras’s largest creditors and export markets.

Chinese investment in Brazilian renewables started with hydropower, which still dominates Brazil’s energy mix. Since 2015, China Three Gorges has deployed more than USD 5 billion in hydro acquisitions and upgrades. State Power Investment Corporation followed suit, paying USD 2.4 billion for the São Simão dam in Goiás state, but both firms have since pivoted to Brazil’s wind-rich Northeast region.

Lula also returned from Beijing touting a pledge from China General Nuclear to invest more than USD 500 million in a renewable‑energy complex in Piauí, also in the Northeast, adding to an ever-growing pipeline of Chinese-led wind and solar projects in the region.

A ‘notable’ increase

These investments are part of what Claudia Trevisan, executive director of the Brazil-China Business Council, described to Dialogue Earth as a “notable increase in Chinese-led projects linked to sustainability.”

With vast potential for growth in its already significant solar, wind and biofuels sectors, as well as a huge electricity market and a grid that is already made up of 90% low-carbon sources, many analysts are excited about Brazil’s green future.

“Brazil has the potential to emerge as a green energy hub, not just for Latin America, but for the world – and I think China sees this potential,” Paulo Feldmann, an economics professor at the University of São Paulo, told Dialogue Earth.

On signing the “Fuel of the Future” law, which locks in demand for low-carbon fuels, Lula vowed in October 2024 that Brazil will “deliver the greatest energy revolution on Earth”. Chinese officials and executives also appear optimistic. The CEO of Goldwind has spoken of Brazil’s

“unrivalled” wind resources, while “green development” was placed at the centre of China-Brazil cooperation last November, when the two countries signed an agreement on aligning China’s Belt and Road Initiative with Lula’s New Industry Brazil and Ecological Transformation plans – even if Brazil has continued to snub membership of China’s flagship overseas investment initiative.

But the twin goals of industrialisation and green transformation do not always align, with surging imports presenting challenges to local manufacturing hopes. Last year, the Global South overtook the Global North as the main export market for Chinese solar panels. Meanwhile, emerging EV markets like Brazil remain small in absolute terms, but they are growing fast and overwhelmingly dominated by Chinese exports.

Both these trends have been positive from a climate perspective. In Pakistan, ultra-cheap Chinese panels have triggered a grassroots solar boom, and according to Rodrigo Sauaia, the CEO of Brazilian industry group Absolar, a similar phenomenon is underway in Brazil – “we could talk about a solar transformation in the past ten years,” he told Dialogue Earth.

“As the Global South looks to decarbonise, China’s scale and ability to deliver low-cost clean energy technologies make it an indispensable partner,” said Aya Adachi, an associate fellow at the German Council for Foreign Relations. However, Adachi noted that these countries are not simply looking to import products – “they are adopting local content requirements and tariffs to encourage more value-added production”, she says, noting that “between 2016 and 2024, around two-thirds of global trade defence measures targeting China came from developing countries”.

Edgar Barassa, an expert in e-mobility with Barassa & Cruz consulting, highlighted risks for local industrial capacities. “The challenge is that Chinese firms – facing domestic overcapacity in EVs and batteries – are incentivised to export surplus production or assemble vehicles abroad with minimal integration.” Speaking to Dialogue Earth, he warned that “if left unchecked, this dynamic risks entrenching a peripheral role for Brazil in the clean tech value chain”.

Sticks and carrots

In an attempt to confront this challenge, Brasília has combined an arsenal of sticks and carrots to bring production onshore. Among these, the Brazilian development bank (BNDES) has unlocked BRL 300 billion (USD 54 billion) in subsidised credit under the New Industry Brazil strategy, while the auto‑focused Mover programme provides tax credits to firms so long as they relocate production to Brazil and channel a share of their turnover into domestic research and development.

On the defensive front, the government has reinstated import duties on electric vehicles, rising to 35% by July 2026; re‑imposed tariffs on solar panels, raising them to 25% in November 2024; and approved a hike in tariffs on completed wind turbines, from 11.2% to 25% by January 2026.

To some extent, Beijing and its corporate champions also face a dilemma – whether to keep relying on exports of ultra-competitive Chinese products or to invest in local manufacturing, placating Brazilian demands for investment and helping turn Brazil into a launchpad for Latin American exports.

Brazil can be a base for Chinese production to export to South America,” says GWM’s Bastos, “but for this, we must comply with a lot of local content rules”.

Concern about “unbalanced trade” with countries in the Global South is increasingly prevalent among Chinese think-tankers. Liu Hongzhong, for instance, who teaches economics at Xi’an Jiaotong University in Shaanxi, urges “more balanced and sustainable economic and trade cooperation with countries in the Global South”.

According to Adachi, “Beijing is aware of the tensions created by growing trade imbalances with the Global South, but unlike its often forceful responses to trade actions by high-income nations, China has largely avoided retaliating against developing countries”.

The clutch of manufacturing deals that Lula secured in May are evidence that Beijing is listening, but the jury is still out on how successful Brazil will be in capturing more of the cleantech value chain from China.

“I am cautiously optimistic,” said Barassa, “but the challenge lies in translating memoranda of understanding into investment projects that generate measurable socio-economic outcomes”.

Celio Hiratuka, an associate professor at the State University of Campinas, echoed this sentiment: “It’s too early to tell if the government has been successful,” he told Dialogue Earth. “GWM appears serious about selecting suppliers and is betting on local content, but I think that BYD is still testing the market – their strategy might be to postpone the moment they need to [begin to] produce here in Brazil.”

Recommended

BYD has faced criticism for flooding the market with imports, including via its car-carrier ship, the BYD Shenzhen, which is the largest vessel of its type in the world.

Bastos also admits that there is a limit to the extent that GWM can localise manufacturing of important components like batteries. “Producing the cells would be very, very expensive, but we are talking with suppliers about assembling batteries in Brazil,” he said.

“As to how much we can expect to onshore – that’s a difficult question,” André Cieplinski, of the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) in Brazil, told Dialogue Earth. “But even if we can’t onshore the whole battery manufacturing process, if we are able to nationalise other components, the result can be net positive for jobs.”

Although Cieplinski said that the Brazilian development bank has been very important for the development of solar in Brazil, Absolar’s Rodrigo Sauaia suggested that the government has not gone far enough in its industrial policy: “Brazil is the only possible hub for local manufacturing of solar photovoltaics in South America, but for that to develop, there are still some policies we need to work on.”

Referring to the government’s tariffs on solar panels, Sauaia added that, “rather than choke the market, it would be better to establish constructive policies – to use the government’s buying power to create demand and to establish strong industrial policy that incentivises the establishment of manufacturing hubs in Brazil”.

The CEO of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association, Elbia Gannoum, is more bullish on the state of Brazil’s wind industry and the role of government policy. “The Brazilian government has made significant efforts to keep the local supply chain active with job creation and to attract wind turbine manufacturing to the country,” she told Dialogue Earth, noting that “between 60% and 80% of wind turbine components (including blades, towers, and nacelles) are already manufactured in Brazil”.

Hiratuka said: “The Brazilian government is going in the right direction with its industrial policy, but they need to stay firm in the face of pressure from Chinese firms.”

For Hiratuka, the main risk lies in the general election due to be held in 2026: “The current government is moving in the right direction, but everything could change with a political turn at the next election.”",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/08/Brazilian-President-Lula-tests-an-electric-car-from-Great-Wall-Motors-_Ricardo-Stuckert_Palacio-do-Planalto_2c877ce3e8-1200px-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-08-08 13:05:25.867289

Although Donald Trump is a windbag, he has ordered not to allow wind power from oceans designated for such projects.

The move applies to more than 1.4 million hectares of federal waters across California (slated off San Luis Obispo County), Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management announced on July 30 it was rescinding huge swaths of ocean initially set aside for the fast-tracking of offshore wind projects by the administration of former president Barack Obama and expanded by former president Joe Biden.

Our local Rep. Salud Carbajal was quick to make a statement.

“This is another backwards policy decision by the Trump administration that will hurt our wind energy sector and the thousands of jobs it supports.”

“Wind power is no longer theoretical—it’s vital to our economy and energy security. Undermining renewables not only hurts American workers and businesses, but it also hands the future of clean energy to global competitors like China. This is an America Last policy approach.”

To add insult to injury, Interior said that it was considering halting all wind development on federal lands.

Also with a quick response, Sierra Club's Deputy Legislative Director Xavier Boatright said: “With the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump and Doug Burgum have put thousands of Americans out of work. If Trump had any ounce of compassion or care for the American people and truly wanted to build U.S. energy dominance, he would be bolstering renewable energy projects like Empire that create stable jobs, allow families to breathe easier, and save more on electricity. Instead, Trump is yet again prioritizing the interests of Big Fossil Fuel, and making Americans pay the price.”

When Trump was at his golf course in Scotland recently, he went on a rant against wind energy, claiming they are ugly, killing hundreds of birds and made whales go crazy.

Trump’s opposition is nothing new, and his war on wind energy began during a long-running battle with Scottish authorities over 11 wind turbines that can be seen from his Turnberry luxury golf resort. The legal challenge, launched in 2013, was ultimately dismissed by the UK Supreme Court in December 2015.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.","The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.

The funding, part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American “energy dominance in the global market.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal.

“Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong—it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.”

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

“These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

“This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.”

Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

Gehrke says there's little oversight governing how an administration manages government websites.

""We really need to protect our information better,"" they say. ""Websites are the primary means by which the government communicates with the public."" And Gehrke says good information is essential for the public to participate in a democracy.

Coca-Cola has stated they plan to release a line of their signature beverage sweetened with sugarcane in the U.S. this fall.","It’s planting season for sugarcane farmers in Louisiana as they replenish fields that are older than three years and no longer yielding as much sugar.

When President Donald Trump said he wanted Coca-Cola to use sugarcane in its signature drink, instead of high-fructose corn syrup, it brought a lot of attention to the industry.

Patrick Frischhertz is the son-in-law of an eighth generation sugarcane farmer. He’s been in the business for close to 16 years, and he oversees St. Louis Planting in Plaquemine. The company farms sugarcane and soybeans. When Trump boasted he’d convinced Coca-Cola to use natural sugar, Frischhertz said it was welcome news.

“It seems to be getting everybody talking about sugar cane in Louisiana and our natural product. And as farmers we're really appreciative of it,” Frischhertz.

Israel Huerta is originally from Mexico, and he’s been a U.S. citizen since 2013. He’s worked on the farm in Plaquemine for even longer. He admits he’s biased when it comes to comparing the high-fructose corn syrup in Coca-Cola to the one made with sugarcane.

“Actually, I think in Mexico they use that already. They use sugarcane and it tastes better. And it's, it is more, uh, it's not, I'm not, I'm not gonna say healthy, but it’s better, you know? Yeah. It's better,” Huerta.

According to the USDA, Florida produces the most sugarcane in the country–more than 17 million tons annually, followed by Louisiana, which produces 13.8 million tons.

So if there is an increase in demand, farmers here are likely to see it. I asked Frischhertz if he’s noticed this.

“ No, no. Our farm has not heard anything from any distributors or beverage manufacturers about trying to increase sugar, by any means. For us, it's business as usual and working hard out in the field to produce the best crop that we possibly can,” said Frischhertz.

Coca-Cola has stated they plan to release a line of their signature beverage sweetened with sugarcane in the U.S. this fall.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49d7bfb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+263/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F85%2Fbbea70d14b59b2467b7f9c727f6d%2Fimg-8288.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:08:42.036504

What’s going on: In June, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the previous administration’s 2024 greenhouse gas emissions regulations for certain traditional power plants.
“Manufacturers commend the EPA for acknowledging the unworkability of the previous administration’s rule,” NAM Vice President of Domestic Policy Chris Phalen told EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on Tuesday.
Repeal of the 2024 rule is a crucial start in getting “as much electricity generation online as possible,” Phalen continued.
No relief without reform: Repealing the 2024 rule keeps many traditional plants online, which is a must as the national energy appetite grows due to data center expansion, Phalen said.","The Environmental Protection Agency’s move to repeal the previous administration’s 2024 Power Plant Rule is a positive one for manufacturing in the U.S.—but to truly unleash American energy’s potential, we need permitting reform, too, the NAM told the EPA this week.

Repeal of the 2024 rule is a crucial start in getting “as much electricity generation online as possible,” Phalen continued. “But without comprehensive permitting reform to enable the buildout of new and modernized plants of all types in a timely manner, including traditional generation and plants using lower emissions technologies like [carbon capture and sequestration] and hydrogen, there is a serious risk we fall short of our energy generation needs.”

Why it makes sense: The NAM laid out its primary reasons for supporting the proposed rescission, which include the following:

The requirement that some achieve a 90% carbon capture rate was arbitrary and unfeasible given that carbon capture and sequestration technology is not yet at commercial scale.

The plant closures that would result from the rule’s implementation would threaten grid reliability.

No relief without reform: Repealing the 2024 rule keeps many traditional plants online, which is a must as the national energy appetite grows due to data center expansion, Phalen said.

FEOC Restrictions: A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.","This is an updated version of the alert published on July 4.

President Trump signed H.R.1, commonly referred to as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (the ""Act"") into law on July 4, 2025. Below are our summaries of the amendments to certain tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (""IRA"") as well as our initial observations.

The focus of the changes in the Act are as follows:

Special rules apply to wind and solar, including (i) a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for facilities beginning construction after July 4, 2026, (ii) removal of ""energy property"" under section 48 from 5-year MACRS depreciation, and (iii) amendments to the applicable domestic content percentages under section 48E;

Enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions, including (i) application of the ""material assistance"" rules to wind and solar facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2025, (ii) extending the period for assessment to 6 years for a deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"", and (iii) introducing accuracy-related penalties for understatements of income tax by more than 1% due to overstating the ""material assistance cost ratio"" of property qualifying for credits under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E;

Codification of the beginning of construction rules in IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025, for purposes of the FEOC requirements;

Parity for different uses and updated utilizations of qualified carbon oxide apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Section Penalty Description Penalty Amount Sec. 666216

Substantial understatement of income tax due to disallowance of applicable energy credits:

Stricter penalty threshold when the IRS disallows a taxpayer's claimed energy credit (e.g., 45X, 45Y, or 48E) due to foreign entity restrictions or material assistance violations

A 1% misstatement of the tax liability triggers a 20% penalty.

Applies to credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions

Sec. 6695B

Substantial misstatements on certifications provided by suppliers:

New proposed penalty that targets suppliers or manufacturers who issue false certifications regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing

Applies to certifications provided after Dec. 31, 2025

Greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification

Observation: Projects seeking tax credits under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the Act, except as described below with respect to the termination of 2% energy credit. To be eligible for tax credits under sections 45 or 48, a project (except for ground or groundwater thermal systems, as described below) must have begun construction before Jan. 1, 2025, and generally be placed in service within 4 years (or 10 years in the case of offshore wind) after the year in which construction begun.

§168 – Accelerated Cost Recovery System (Depreciation)

Section 45Y and 48E property continues to be listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

""Energy property"" as defined in section 48 is no longer listed as 5-year MACRS property under section 168.

Observation: Without a specific indication to the contrary, there are arguments that such property continues to be subject to the MACRS rules/guidance, which include general rules regarding the determination of MACRS class lives (such as Rev. Proc. 87-56).

Alternatively, taxpayers appear to be able to elect the alternative depreciation system and apply 12-year, straight-line recovery under section 168(g).

45Y – Clean Electricity Production Credit & §48E – Clean Electricity Investment Credit

Placed in Service Deadline for Wind and Solar: Credits terminate for wind and solar facilities that (i) begin construction after July 4, 2026, and (ii) are not placed in service before Jan. 1, 2028—facilities that begin construction by July 4, 2026, are not subject to the placed in service deadline.

Phase-Out for other technologies: All technology other than wind and solar will phase out after 2032 as follows:

100% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2033;

75% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2034;

50% credit for facilities beginning construction during 2035; and

0% credit for facilities beginning construction after Dec. 31, 2035.

Observation: The version of the bill initially passed by the House of Representatives included deadlines based on beginning construction (within 60 days of enactment) and being placed in service (by Dec. 31, 2028). The Senate Finance Committee's version of the bill included a modified phaseout for wind and solar based on beginning construction by Dec. 31, 2027, however that proposal was then replaced with a placed in service deadline of Dec. 31, 2027, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026.

Observation: The accelerated timeline for wind and solar projects to be placed in service (as compared to the phase out for other technologies) presents additional challenges for developers faced with construction and supply uncertainty and potential inability to control the timing for when their facilities can be placed in service.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers whose facilities are determined to be under ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025, and include ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Observation: Requiring that ""effective control"" be ""determined"", in this context, implies that the determination will be made during post-filing examination and enforcement.

Special ITC Recapture Rule: 100% of ITCs claimed under section 48E with respect to a property will be recaptured if a ""specified taxpayer"" (i.e., one who is allowed an ITC for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2027) makes an ""applicable payment"" within 10 years after the property is placed in service.

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

Special Rule for Residential Property: No credit is allowed for residential solar water heating property or small wind energy property if the taxpayer/owner rents or leases such property to a third party.

Observation: Projects subject to PPAs and other property (such as battery storage projects) are apparently not subject to the rule above.

Observation: Residential solar electric property is not subject to the rule above. Therefore, residential solar electric property leased to customers is still eligible for section 45Y or 48E credits provided that other credit eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Observation: Residential projects that can demonstrate that they began construction in 2024 may qualify for the ITC under section 48.

Nuclear Energy Communities: Advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area that has (or at any time after Dec. 31, 2009, has had) 0.17% of greater direct employment related to advanced nuclear power are eligible for the energy community bonus credit amount for PTCs under section 45Y (but not for ITCs under section 48E).

Correction to Domestic Content Percentages Under 48E: The domestic content applicable percentage under 48E for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is revised to match current 45Y as follows:

40% (or 20% for offshore wind) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (or 27.5% for offshore wind) if construction begins after June 16, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2026;

50% (or 35% for offshore wind) if construction begins during 2026; and

55% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2026.

Special Rules for Fuel Cell Property: For qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is fixed at 30% and can not be increased or otherwise adjusted, and the zero GHG emissions requirement and recapture rule for GHG emissions greater than 10 grams of C02e per KWh does not apply.

Observation: The fixed 30% ITC rate for fuel cell property suggests that PWA compliance is no longer necessary to qualify for the full ITC rate, however the ITC rate can not be increased through bonus credit amounts for energy community or domestic content or otherwise.

§45Q – Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit

Parity of Credit Rate: For facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the base credit amount is the same regardless of whether the taxpayer merely disposed of the captured carbon oxide or undertakes use or utilization of the captured carbon oxide, as follows:

$17 ($36 for direct air capture) for tax years beginning in a calendar year after 2024 and before 2027 (indexed for 2025-inflation for any taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2026).

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025.

§45U – Clean Electricity Production (For Existing Nuclear Facilities)

The credit terminates for electricity produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027; and

Transferability continues to be available for the duration of the credit period.

§45V – Clean Hydrogen Production Credit

This credit is terminated for facilities that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2027.

Observation: The FEOC restrictions apparently do not apply to section 45V.

§45X – Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Except as noted below, the credit rate phases out based on the date the eligible components are sold:

Before Jan. 1, 2030: 100%;

During 2030: 75%;

During 2031: 50%;

During 2032: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2032: 0%.

Wind energy components produced and sold after December 31, 2027, are not credit eligible.

For critical minerals other than metallurgical coal, the credit rate phases out as follows based on the date the critical minerals are produced:

Before Jan. 1, 2031: 100%;

During 2031: 75%;

During 2032: 50%;

During 2033: 25%;

After Dec. 31, 2033: 0%.

Inclusion of Metallurgical Coal as a Critical Mineral: Metallurgical coal that is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the Department of Energy notice ""Critical Mineral List; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking"" (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))) is credit-eligible at a rate of 2.5% of the costs incurred by the taxpayer with respect to production, regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.

Metallurgical coal produced after Dec. 31, 2029, is not credit eligible.

Observation: Under section 45X(d)(2) (not modified by the Act), sales are taken into account for section 45X credits only when production of eligible components is within the United States (or its possession). It remains to be seen whether this provision effectively requires the production of metallurgical coal to be within the United States to be credit-eligible.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025;

Taxpayers who are determined to have produced eligible components through ""effective control"" by a ""specified foreign entity"" in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Eligible components produced in tax years beginning after July 4, 2025 that include any ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"".

Additional Requirement for Battery Modules: To be credit-eligible, battery modules are required to be comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Sale of Integrated Components: For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026, sales of integrated components are credit-eligible only if the ""primary component"" is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a ""secondary component"" (i) that is produced within the same manufacturing facility as the primary component, (ii) that is sold to an unrelated person, and (iii) for which not less than 65% of the total direct material costs are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.

Observation: Taxpayers may still elect to treat a sale of components to a related person as being made to an unrelated person.

§45Z – Clean Fuel Production Credit

The credit period is extended until Dec. 31, 2029 (based on when the fuel is sold).

Fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transportation fuel emissions rates published after Dec. 31, 2025, can not be less than zero.

Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use charge, and Treasury will provide distinct emissions rates for transportation fuels derived from animal manure, including dairy, swine, and poultry.

Prevention of Double Credit: fuel produced from a fuel that generated a credit under section 45Z is not credit eligible, and Treasury is authorized to issue guidance on preventing the doubling of 45Z credits.

Sales to Unrelated Persons: Treasury is authorized to prescribe rules for sales to related persons whom the taxpayer has reason to believe will sell fuel to an unrelated person.

Special Rules for Sustainable Aviation Fuel:

For fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (and fuel sold or used before July 4, 2025 that has not yet been allowed or paid a credit under section 6426(k)), the sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) is not allowed for any gallon of fuel that could receive a credit under section 45Z.

For fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, the increased credit rate for SAF does not apply.

The sustainable aviation fuel credit under section 6426(k) does not apply to any sale or use for any period after September 30, 2025.

Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit: For fuel sold or used after June 30, 2025:

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit under section 40A is extended to sale or use on or before Dec. 31, 2026;

The credit amount is increased from $0.10 to $0.20 per gallon of qualified agri-biodiesel production, and is in addition to any credit determined under section 45Z with respect to such gallon of fuel;

The small agri-biodiesel producer credit may be transferred pursuant to section 6418; and

Eligible small agri-biodiesel is required to be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

FEOC restrictions disallow credit to:

Taxpayers who are a ""specified foreign entity"" for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025; and

Taxpayers who are a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (without regard to ""effective control"") for tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

§48 – Energy Credit

The 2% energy credit is terminated for any energy property beginning construction after June 16, 2025.

Observation: For projects beginning construction on or after Jan. 1, 2025, only ground or groundwater thermal systems remain eligible for the 6% energy credit, because other energy property eligible for a 6% energy credit (including fuel cells, solar, geothermal, small wind property, waste energy recovery property, energy storage technology, biogas property, microgrid controllers, and combined heat and power property) converted to the “tech-neutral” ITC under section 48E.

§48C – Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit

As of July 4, 2025, allocations revoked for failure to place the project in service within 2 years from the date of certification will not be restored to the total amount of allocations under the program.

§48D – Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit

For qualified property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025, the credit rate is increased to 35%.

Observation: An advanced manufacturing facility must begin construction before Jan. 1, 2027, to be eligible for credits under section 48D.

§6418 – Transfer of Certain Credits

The Act does not include a deadline with respect to the transfer of credits; however, transfers of credits under 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E to a ""specified foreign entity"" are prohibited.

Observation: The preservation of transferability is undermined by the accelerated expiration of the credits themselves.

Observation: Additional FEOC requirements apply to credits under sections 45Y,48E, and 45X than to credits under sections 45U, 45Q, 45Z, and 48.

FEOC Restrictions:

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" is either (i) a specified foreign entity or (ii) a foreign-influenced entity.

""Specified foreign entities"" include:

entities designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State;17

entities included on the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control;18

entities alleged by the Attorney General to have engaged in conduct for which a conviction was obtained under certain laws;19

entities determined by the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence, to be engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to U.S national security or foreign policy;

Chinese military company operating in the United States;20

entities Listed Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act; or21

certain battery producing entities.22

Specified foreign entities include ""foreign controlled entities"" such as (i) the government of a covered nation (e.g., China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea), (ii) an agency or instrumentality of a government of a covered nation, (iii) a citizen or national of a covered nation without U.S. status as a citizen, national or lawful permanent resident, (iv) an entity organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation, or (v) an entity controlled by any of the above, including subsidiaries, measured by more than 50% ownership of stock in a corporation, profits interests or capital interests in a partnership, or other beneficial interest in the entity (under the section 318 attribution rules).

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation is excluded from the definition of exchange or market for this purpose, and (ii) such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-controlled entity if 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

An entity is a ""foreign-influenced entity"" if:

(i) During the taxable year:

A specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint a board member, executive officer, or similar individual;

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of the entity;

One or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity; or

At least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities; or

(ii) During the prior taxable year, the entity made an ""applicable payment"" to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise ""effective control"" over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any related person) or (ii) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral or production of an eligible component by the taxpayer (or any related person):

""Effective control"" generally means 1 or more agreements or arrangements which provide 1 or more contractual counterparties (or related person) of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held.

Until FEOC guidance is issued, ""effective control"" means the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to make certain major decisions for the taxpayer (including any related party to the taxpayer), such as (i) determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible components, (ii) determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity or the storage or electrical energy, (iii) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit, (iv) determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility, (v) restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty, or (vi) on an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production of eligible components or electricity.

With respect to a licensing agreement entered into with a contractual counterparty (or related person), ""effective control"" also means a contractual right to (i) specify or otherwise direct 1 or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals, (ii) direct the operation, (iii) limit the taxpayer's utilization of intellectual property, (iv) receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar arrangement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions), (v) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer (or any related party) to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions), or the contract, agreement, or other arrangement (vi) does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty (or related person) or a specified foreign entity, or (vii) was entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025.

There is an exception for a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. However, a bona fide purchase or sale does not include any purchase or sale of intellectual property where the agreement provides that ownership of the intellectual property reverts to the contractual counterparty after a period of time.

There is an exception for publicly traded entities, except such entity shall still be deemed to be a foreign-influenced entity if (i) a specified foreign entity has the authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single specified foreign entity owns not less than 25% of the publicly traded entity, (iii) 1 or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate not less than 40% of the publicly traded entity, or (iv) debt in excess of 15% of the publicly traded debt of the publicly traded entity has been issued to 1 or more specified foreign entities.

Whether construction or production of any property includes ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" is determined based on whether the ""material assistance cost ratio"" is less than the ""threshold percentage"".

Threshold percentages:

For any qualified facility under sections 45Y or 48E, the threshold percentages are:

40% if construction begins in 2026;

45% if construction begins in 2027;

50% if construction begins in 2028;

55% if construction begins in 2029; and

60% if construction begins after Dec. 31, 2029.

For energy storage technology under section 48E, the threshold percentages are:

55% if construction begins in 2026;

60% if construction begins in 2027;

65% if construction begins in 2028;

70% if construction begins in 2029; and

75% if construction begins in after Dec. 31, 2029.

For solar energy components, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

60% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For wind energy components, the threshold percentages are:

85% if sold during 2026; and

90% if sold during 2027.

For inverters, the threshold percentages are:

50% if sold during 2026;

55% if sold during 2027;

60% if sold during 2028;

65% if sold during 2029; and

70% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For qualifying battery components, the threshold percentages are:

60% if sold during 2026;

65% if sold during 2027;

70% if sold during 2028;

80% if sold during 2029; and

85% if sold after Dec. 31, 2029.

For applicable critical minerals, the threshold percentages are:

0% if sold after Dec. 31, 2025 and before Jan. 1, 2030;

25% if sold during 2030;

30% if sold during 2031;

40% if sold during 2032; and

50% if sold after Dec. 31, 2032.

Observation: For purposes of the FEOC requirements, the Act codifies that ""beginning of construction"" for tax purposes is determined pursuant to rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either Notice), as in effect on Jan. 1, 2025.

Observation: Treasury is required to issue guidance not later than Dec. 31, 2027, applying new threshold percentages for critical minerals equaling or exceeding these amounts, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

Material assistance cost ratios:

For any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total costs of all manufactured products incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology upon completion of construction.

""Manufactured product"" has the same meaning as provided in domestic content guidance.

For any product line that produces eligible components, the material assistance cost ratio is the ratio of (i) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components minus such costs that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, divided by (ii) the total direct materials costs that are paid or incurred for production of such eligible components.

Safe harbor tables: Treasury must issue material assistance safe harbor tables by Dec. 31, 2026. Until then, and for qualified facilities that begin construction within 60 days after the issuance of such tables, a taxpayer may (i) use the tables provided in the domestic content safe harbor guidance (IRS Notice 2025-08) to establish the total direct material cost of any listed eligible component or manufactured product and (ii) rely on a certification by the supplier that the manufactured product, eligible component, constituent element, material, or subcomponent was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

Certification requirement: The certification from the supplier is required to (i) include the supplier's EIN, (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury, (iii) be retained by the supplier for not less than 6 years and be provided to the IRS upon request, and (iv) state either (1) that such property was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity, or (2) the total direct material cost for each product or component that were not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity.

If a taxpayer knows or has reason to know that a manufactured product or eligible component was produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity, then the taxpayer must treat all direct material costs with respect to such product or component as mined, produced, or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity and may not rely on a certification from the supplier.

Binding written contract exception: Upon the election of the taxpayer (in form and manner to be designated by Treasury), any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent acquired by the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and placed in service before Jan. 1, 2030 (January 1, 2028 in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility that began construction before August 1, 2025, is not included for purposes of determining the material assistance cost ratio.

Observation: The imposition of FEOC rules to tax credit qualification introduces an additional layer of complexity. The statute further authorizes the Treasury Department to issue regulations under these rules, including establishing rules to prevent evasion, circumvention, or abuse of the rules through (i) impermissible technology licensing arrangements with specified foreign entities, (ii) abuse of the binding written contract exception through stockpiling of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent material, or subcomponent during any period prior to application of the rules, or where the facts and circumstances demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.

Extended assessment period: Any deficiency attributable to an error in the determination of material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity may be assessed within 6 years after the return for such year was filed.

Accuracy-related penalty: If there is a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"", then the substantial understatement of income tax penalty applies to understatements of income tax by more than 1% of the tax required to be shown on the return.

A ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" means a disallowance of a credit under sections 45X, 45Y, or 48E by reason of overstating the material assistance cost ratio.

For an entity claiming direct pay under section 6417, a ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" causes an ""excessive payment"" and incurs the 20% penalty on the amount of the excessive payment (unless the taxpayer shows reasonable cause).

Penalty for false certification of supplier: If an inaccurate or false certification by a supplier results in the ""disallowance of an applicable energy credit"" and the understatement of income tax exceeds the lesser of (i) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return or (ii) $100,000, then the person making the certification is required to pay a penalty equal to the greater of (a) 10% of the amount of the underpayment attributable to the inaccuracy or falsity or (b) $5,000 (unless the person shows reasonable cause).

But retain the NSPS for low and intermediate load combustion turbines (CT) and the Phase 1 base load CT limits.
EPA finalized the 2024 GHG Standards despite these serious concerns, APPA said.
To get around that problem in the 2024 GHG Standards, EPA inappropriately relied on tax credits, APPA argued.
EPA’s selection of an annual capacity factor of 40 percent as the dividing threshold between simple-cycle combustion turbines and combined-cycle combustion turbines should be eliminated or revised upwards, APPA added.","The American Public Power Association recently submitted comments in response to a proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to repeal greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector.

The EPA this summer announced its proposal to repeal the 2024 Carbon Pollution Standards that regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing and new power plants.

The Proposed Rule offers two approaches to repealing or revising the 2024 GHG Standards.

The first approach is EPA’s “Primary Proposal.” The Primary Proposal would repeal the 2024 GHG Standards in their entirety based on a finding that GHG emissions from the covered electric generating units (EGU) source category do not significantly contribute to endangerment of public health and welfare.

If finalized, the Primary Proposal would also have the effect of repealing all regulations of GHG emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants. Which include EGUs regulated under 40 C.F.R Part 60, Subpart UUUUb, Subpart TTTT and Subpart TTTTa and all associated rulemakings, including the 2015 new source performance standards (NSPS) and the 2024 GHG Standards.

The second option is EPA’s “Alternative Proposal.”

The Alternative Proposal would repeal the 2024 GHG Standards for existing fossil fuel fired power plants in Subpart UUUUb based on changes to EPA’s best system of emission reduction (BSER) determinations. Further the Alternative Proposal would repeal the Phase II GHG Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants at Subpart TTTTa for base load natural gas fired combustion turbines. But retain the NSPS for low and intermediate load combustion turbines (CT) and the Phase 1 base load CT limits.

APPA Comments

Demand for electricity is increasing rapidly, and this is forecast to continue for the foreseeable future. Public power utilities need immediate relief from the 2024 GHG Standards to ensure that they will be able to continue providing reliable and affordable electricity to their customers, APPA said.

APPA and others, including regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that are responsible for grid reliability, told EPA during the rulemaking for the proposed 2024 GHG Standards that the standards would threaten electric reliability, would increase health and safety concerns, result in increased electricity costs, and potentially undermine public support for prudent GHG reducing programs. EPA finalized the 2024 GHG Standards despite these serious concerns, APPA said.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s recent Long-Term Reliability Assessment predicts massive increases in electricity demand over the next ten years and contains warnings regarding “critical reliability challenges.”

APPA said that the 2024 GHG Standards will compound these reliability issues because they will lead to the early retirement of coal-fired generation and because they impose capacity factor limitations on new, larger combined cycle combustion turbines.

The 2024 GHG Standards are already having an adverse effect on the ability of electric generators to construct new base load generation to meet increased demand, APPA argued.

APPA urged the EPA to finalize the Alternative Proposal, which if coupled with the revisions needed to the NSPS for new base load combustion turbines in Phase 1 and for intermediate combustion turbines discussed in the comments, provide needed relief to the power industry.

APPA went on to say that the portions of the 2024 GHG Standards that reply on a best system of emissions reduction (BSER) of 90 percent carbon capture and storage (CCS) do not comply with the requirements of section 111 of the CAA, and EPA properly proposes to repeal them.

EPA properly proposes to find that CCS is not adequately demonstrated at stationary combustion turbines, APPA said.

The two projects EPA cited in the 2024 GHG Standards to support its determination that CCS was adequately demonstrated actually support the opposite conclusion, APPA argued.

The Bellingham Energy Center was a slipstream facility that is not comparable to EGUs, and the Peterhead Power Station in Scotland is not yet operational. Other projects cited by EPA are not operational (or not even constructed), APPA pointed out.

EPA properly proposes to find that CCS is not adequately demonstrated for steam generating units, APPA said.

EPA relied primarily on the Boundary Dam Unit 3 project, which has never demonstrated 90 percent capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) and which is a relatively small power plant of only 110 megawatts (MW).

Other projects cited by EPA are small, capture CO2 from a slipstream, do not capture CO2 at a 90 percent level, and/or received federal funding that disqualifies it from consideration as a BSER. EPA also cited unconstructed projects and vendor statements, neither of which can support a BSER determination.

APPA said that EPA properly proposes to find that the NSPS and presumptive standards of performance that are based on a 90 percent CCS BSER are not achievable.

No commercial EGU has ever achieved 90 percent CCS on a sustained basis, as the 2024 GHG Standards require, and EPA did not cite a single example of a facility meeting this standard in the final 2024 GHG Standards, APPA noted.

Other reasons also support EPA’s determination that CCS is not achievable, including the infrastructure needed for CCS, including pipelines and storage facilities, does not exist, and it cannot be constructed by the compliance deadlines in the 2024 GHG Standards, and many areas of the country do not have convenient access to geologic storage for CCS.

APPA said that EPA properly proposes to find that CCS is not cost-effective. In past rulemakings, the agency previously has consistently rejected CCS as too costly. To get around that problem in the 2024 GHG Standards, EPA inappropriately relied on tax credits, APPA argued.

But tax credits do not reduce the costs of CCS, the trade group said -- they transfer them from power plant owners to taxpayers. Even if tax credits could be taken into account, there are significant limitations on the ability of an owner to obtain them, and nothing would prevent Congress from taking them away, APPA said.

Many other obstacles exist that prevent CCS from being considered as a “best” system to reduce GHG emissions from EGUs, including: (1) geographic and site limitations; (2) water constraints; and (3) parasitic load, APPA went on to say.

The portion of the 2024 GHG Standards that identifies co-firing with 40 percent natural gas as the BSER for existing medium-term coal-fired steam generating units does not comply with section 111 of the CAA, and EPA properly proposes to repeal it, APPA said.

Requiring a coal-fired EGU to become a “hybrid” plant that burns 40 percent natural gas constitutes impermissible generation shifting and is beyond EPA’s authority, the comments said.

Even if fuel switching were permissible, which it is not, the presumptive emission limit based on 40 percent co-firing is not achievable because the majority of coal plants do not have access to natural gas, and the vast majority of those plants that do have access to gas use it only at very low levels for boiler startup or to hold the unit in “warm standby,” APPA said.

And co-firing with 40 percent natural gas is not cost-effective because of the need to construct expensive pipeline infrastructure.

APPA said that EPA properly proposes to repeal the requirements for existing natural gas- and oil-fired steam generating units because these requirements would result in only de minimis -- if any -- emission reductions but would impose significant requirements on states to develop state plans. These standards are not necessary, in any event, because they are based on what those sources are already doing (i.e., business as usual).

APPA argued that the major questions doctrine also supports EPA’s Alternative Proposal.

It said that the 2024 GHG Standards did not remedy the legal deficiencies identified by the U.S. Supreme Court in West Virginia v. EPA. Although the 2024 GHG Standards do not require overt generation shifting (with the exception of the 40 percent gas co-firing requirement), they lead to the same result because they are based on technology that is not adequately demonstrated, require compliance with rates that are not achievable, and are not cost-effective.

APPA said that EPA needs to reconsider the CO2 emission standards for new base load combustion turbines in Phase 1 and the standards for intermediate load combustion turbines, and APPA urged the Agency to do so in supplemental rulemaking.

APPA asserted that the existing intermediate load standards are unachievable by even highly efficient turbines, and because the standard is based on a single set of operating parameters, it effectively dictates the types of operations and particular uses of the turbine, which is impermissible under the CAA.

Even if operational constraints can be the basis of the BSER, EPA should have established a significantly higher standard for this subcategory, it said.

APPA said the current Phase 1 NSPS for the base load subcategory is deeply flawed because it is unachievable by a number of highly efficient turbines on the market, adding that EPA based the standard on only one unit that is not representative of the variety of highly efficient combustion turbines that are available on the market.

Even if operational constraints can be the basis of the BSER, the Agency should have established a significantly higher standard for this subcategory, EPA was told.

EPA’s selection of an annual capacity factor of 40 percent as the dividing threshold between simple-cycle combustion turbines and combined-cycle combustion turbines should be eliminated or revised upwards, APPA added.

Combustion turbines operating above a capacity factor of 20 percent should be subcategorized based on their mode of operation (simple cycle and combined cycle) and not on the basis of their utilization.

If EPA retains the current intermediate load and base load subcategories, then the demarcation between the two subcategories needs to be increased.

Although APPA believes the Alternative Proposal offers a more certain and durable option, APPA also offered comments on the Primary Proposal for EPA’s consideration in the event EPA decides to finalize it, perhaps after it finalizes the Alternative Proposal.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-08 13:06:19.482838

The company, which develops hydrogen storage and energy distribution solutions, is investing nearly $4.5 million into the project, which is expected to create at least 61 new, full-time jobs.

Located in the Marcellus Energy Park, the facility will produce hydrogen storage vessels using Verne’s proprietary technology, which stores hydrogen in a cold-and-compressed state to increase its density and enable larger-volume transportation. The company will work closely with regional partners to optimize its supply chain and manufacturing processes.

The site will allow Verne to scale from development to commercial operations while contributing to the growth of the state’s energy infrastructure. The facility will sit on a property within a key energy hub, leveraging local expertise in critical manufacturing processes.

The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development has extended a funding offer to support the project, including a $1 million Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) loan, a $153,000 Pennsylvania First grant, and a $122,000 WEDnetPA grant for employee training. Verne may also apply for Research and Development tax credits.

What people are saying

In a recent quote, Ted McKlveen, Co-founder & CEO, Verne Inc., said, “After conducting a nationwide search, we determined that North Central Pennsylvania was the perfect place to establish our manufacturing footprint. The proximity to key partners in the region was a crucial factor, as it will allow Verne to leverage their expertise to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing processes. This facility will accelerate our impact in delivering energy to power critical industries that are currently not being served by our nation’s electricity grid.”

Governor Josh Shapiro, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, added, “Pennsylvania is making strategic investments to grow our innovation, energy, and manufacturing industries, and Verne clearly recognized that our Commonwealth is competing again because they chose us over Ohio, Michigan, and West Virginia for its first manufacturing facility in the country. My Administration is proud to win deals like this that strengthen our local communities, grow our manufacturing sector, and position Pennsylvania as a national leader in innovation and job creation. We’re competing aggressively for private sector investment — and Pennsylvania is open for business.”

Transwestern owns a 2,590-mile gas pipeline that can deliver 0.9 billion cubic feet a day from southwest Texas to Arizona.
Subscribe to the Construction Dive free daily newsletter The Phoenix-based utility plans to bring power plants online when the pipeline project begins operating, according to Geisler.
Meanwhile, Energy Transfer is seeing growing demand for gas from power plants and data centers, according to Tom Long, the company’s co-CEO.
Earlier this year, Energy Transfer signed its first significant deal with a hyperscaler — a behind-the-meter data center in Texas, according to McCrea.","Arizona Public Service Co. and Salt River Project will buy capacity on Transwestern Pipeline’s just-announced Desert Southwest expansion project, which aims to deliver natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas to Arizona, the utilities said Wednesday.

APS, the project’s anchor customer, will use gas from the pipeline for gas-fired power plants that will support planned data centers in the utility’s service territory, said Ted Geisler, chairman, president and CEO of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., APS’ parent company, during a Wednesday earnings call.

Two Fortis utilities — Tucson Electric Power and UniSource Energy Services — and the City of Mesa, Arizona, are finalizing negotiations with Transwestern, an Energy Transfer unit, according to the utilities.

All existing interstate gas pipelines serving Arizona are fully subscribed, according to the utilities.

Transwestern owns a 2,590-mile gas pipeline that can deliver 0.9 billion cubic feet a day from southwest Texas to Arizona. APS, SRP and TEP buy gas that is delivered on the pipeline.

Transwestern plans to spend about $5.3 billion to expand its system by building 516 miles of 42-inch pipeline and adding compressor stations in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, Energy Transfer said Wednesday. The project would add 1.5 Bcf/day of capacity to the Transwestern system, according to the company. Energy Transfer aims to complete its project by late 2029.

Energy Transfer said it will launch an open season this quarter and expects the remaining capacity on the pipeline expansion to be fully subscribed. Depending on the results of the open season, the project could be expanded, the Dallas-based oil and gas infrastructure company said. Transwestern is considering more than doubling the pipeline’s capacity by using 46-inch pipe, Marshall McCrea, co-CEO of Energy Transfer, said Wednesday during an earnings conference call.

APS expects to spend $7.3 billion over 25 years buying gas on Transwestern’s expansion project, Pinnacle West said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Phoenix-based utility plans to bring power plants online when the pipeline project begins operating, according to Geisler. APS’ contract with Transwestern is flexible so the utility can buy more gas if it needs it, he said.

APS has close to 4.5 GW of committed, high load customer demand, mainly data centers and some manufacturing, in its interconnection queue, with an additional 20 GW of uncommitted, potential large load customers, Geisler said.

The utility set a peak demand record of about 8.5 GW on July 9, up 300 MW from last year’s peak, according to Geisler.

APS expects its electric sales will grow by 4% to 6% a year through 2027, mainly driven by the addition of large loads onto its system, according to Pinnacle West’s earnings presentation. The utility expects to invest about $2.7 billion in generation from 2025 through 2027.

APS is securing roughly 2 GW of power supply through a request for proposals issued in November.

In response to rapid load growth, APS revised its carbon emissions reduction goals on Wednesday. “Reliable service for our customers is our top priority, which has led us to update our clean energy goal from zero carbon [emissions] to carbon neutral by 2050,” Geisler said. “We’re also transitioning away from interim [emissions reduction] targets to better reflect our near-term focus of reliability and affordability for our customers.”

Last year, gas-fired power plants produced 45% of Arizona’s in-state electricity, followed by nuclear power at 27%, solar at 13%, coal at 8%, hydroelectric power at 4% and wind at 2%, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

A similar battery fire occurred in another Proterra bus in November 2022.
“SEPTA has been in regular communication with the FTA regarding the Proterra bus fire,” a spokesperson for the transit authority said.
While it haggled with Proterra over repairing the buses, SEPTA stored them at its Southern Bus Depot.
Colorado-based Proterra declared bankruptcy in 2023 and its transit bus division was purchased by Phoenix Motorcars, a California company.","The Trump administration is citing a recent fire in SEPTA’s decommissioned electric bus fleet as it bashes the federal government’s past investments in environmentally friendly technologies.

The blaze, on June 5, started from the battery in a Proterra electric bus parked in a SEPTA lot in North Philadelphia, burning at least 16 buses and causing a brief spike in air pollutant levels. A similar battery fire occurred in another Proterra bus in November 2022.

The Federal Transit Administration on Wednesday asked SEPTA to provide information on its storage methods for decommissioned electric buses and lithium-ion batteries, while apparently alluding to the Green New Deal, a set of policies to address climate change that was proposed but never enacted.

“This is not the first green deal initiative to backfire with serious long-term ramifications, bringing into question how safe and efficient these investments are,” said Marcus Molinaro, who was confirmed as FTA Administrator this week. “We will investigate what steps can be taken to avoid the public safety risk caused by these vehicles and work to ensure proper safety protocols are in place.”

While the FTA regularly asks local transit agencies to provide information on safety issues and other matters, Molinaro’s letter goes beyond the typically dry bureaucratic language of such requests.

“These incidents cast a disquieting spotlight across the country, raising questions in state capitals and municipal committees alike: How secure are these Proterra assets once retired, and who holds proactive accountability when a ‘green’ initiative becomes a public safety hazard?” he wrote to SEPTA.

“Likewise, FTA expects clear and well-documented evidence that decisions are being made nationwide to mitigate any of these risks. Without this, public support for the clean-energy transit initiatives, which have been fostered under recent administrations, could be jeopardized,” he said.

The federal agency said the request is part of “its routine oversight responsibilities to assess broader national safety risks associated with aging electric vehicle fleets.” In addition to the information on storage protocols, the letter asks SEPTA to explain what it has learned about additional safety procedures that would decrease the likelihood of fires.

“SEPTA has been in regular communication with the FTA regarding the Proterra bus fire,” a spokesperson for the transit authority said. “We are reviewing the requested information and will respond to the FTA prior to the August 20th deadline.”

Buses failed quickly

SEPTA acquired 25 Proterra battery-electric buses in 2019, during President Donald Trump’s first term. They cost $24 million, including $2.6 million provided by the FTA to help cover the higher price compared to hybrid buses.

Funding for the purchases was authorized by a federal transportation bill signed by President Obama in 2015 and a budget bill signed by Trump in 2018. The Green New Deal, a set of energy and economic policies championed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was subsequently proposed in 2019 but did not pass.

The Proterra buses were used on two South Philly bus routes, but they quickly developed problems and were taken out of service in February 2020, after less than a year of use.

With heavy batteries to extend their range and lightweight vehicle frames to reduce power use, they developed cracks throughout the vehicle bodies, PlanPhilly reported in 2021.

Around the same time, Proterra buses were also taken out of service in Minnesota, Indiana, New Mexico and other places due to range issues and other problems.

While it haggled with Proterra over repairing the buses, SEPTA stored them at its Southern Bus Depot. A battery power pack in one of the buses ignited in November 2022, starting a fire that sent smoke billowing from a garage and damaged the bus, the Inquirer reported.

As of earlier this year, SEPTA was storing 15 Proterra buses and 25 other old buses at its Midvale Depot in North Philly, apparently with plans to sell them for scrap. In June, a battery in one of the Proterras started burning, leading to a larger fire that sent up a thick plume of black smoke and destroyed 16 buses, according to the FTA letter.

“We have to get them off of our property, away from the potential where we could have an incident like this,” SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer said at the time. “That could have been far worse. We don’t want to lose an entire facility and, more importantly, we don’t want to hurt anyone. So, we want to get these vehicles off-site.”

While a number of other cities reported problems with Proterra buses, Philadelphia is apparently the only one that has experienced battery fires.

AI technology that promises to solve global challenges while simultaneously consuming vast amounts of energy necessitates a shift in our approach.

By leveraging technological convergence, we can ensure that AI’s continued growth is not a burden on the planet.

The explosive growth of AI is transforming every sector, from healthcare to finance, and it's poised to add trillions to the global economy. Yet, this rapid expansion comes with a significant cost: a burgeoning demand for energy.

As AI models become more complex and computationally intensive, the energy required to train and run them has surged, raising critical concerns about the technology's long-term sustainability. Data centres, the silent engines powering the AI revolution, are now among the largest drivers of rising global power consumption, with projections indicating that AI's demand could rival entire countries by 2030.

This paradox — a technology promising to solve global challenges while simultaneously consuming vast amounts of energy — necessitates a fundamental shift in our approach. The key to navigating this complex challenge lies in technological convergence, a powerful synergy of innovations that can transform AI from an energy liability into a force for a greener energy future. By combining advances in AI with breakthroughs in energy generation, storage and grid management, we can accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system and ensure that AI’s profound benefits are realized without compromising our planet.

The innovations driving a sustainable AI future

Several interconnected technological innovations are paving the path to a greener AI energy future. These solutions are making AI more efficient and can help us use AI to reshape how we produce, distribute and consume energy, without compromising environmental integrity.

AI-driven smart grid management and optimization

The electricity grid is the backbone of our energy system, but it's increasingly strained by rising demand and the intermittency of renewable sources, like solar and wind. This is where the convergence of AI, advanced measurement technologies (such as satellite imagery and LiDAR) and smart grid infrastructure becomes a game-changer for enhancing grid stability and reliability.

AI can analyze vast datasets from smart meters, sensors and weather forecasts to predict energy demand and renewable energy output with unprecedented accuracy. This enables utilities to optimize power distribution, reduce transmission losses and balance baseload requirements in real-time. By dynamically managing the flow of electricity, AI minimizes waste and reduces reliance on fossil fuels.

Managing the variability of wind and solar power is crucial for scaling their adoption. AI can forecast the output of renewable energy sources more effectively, allowing grid operators to better integrate these intermittent sources. When paired with advanced energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries or pumped hydro storage, AI can optimize the charging and discharging of batteries, ensuring a reliable energy supply even during periods of low renewable generation. This capability is vital for achieving a higher penetration of renewables without sacrificing grid stability.

AI-accelerated materials science and advanced manufacturing

The clean energy transition is heavily dependent on new materials and more efficient manufacturing processes for everything from solar panels to batteries and sustainable fuels. AI is a powerful tool for accelerating these breakthroughs, embodying the 'materials informatics' convergence highlighted by the World Economic Forum in its Technology Convergence Report.

As demonstrated by KoBold Metals' use of AI for mineral exploration, AI can dramatically improve the efficiency of discovering and extracting critical battery metals. Beyond exploration, AI can be used to design and discover new, more efficient materials for solar panels (like the perovskite tandem technology), advanced electrolyzers for hydrogen production and cutting-edge battery storage systems.

The convergence of AI with innovative industrial technologies, such as Boston Metal's molten oxide electrolysis for steel production and Coolbrook's RotoDynamic Heater for industrial heat, holds immense potential. These technologies use electricity instead of fossil fuels to reduce carbon emissions in hard-to-abate sectors like steel and cement. When coupled with AI, these processes can be optimized in real-time to maximize efficiency, reduce waste and lower energy consumption.

Converged systems for carbon capture, monitoring and mitigation

The mix of AI, satellite technology and advanced data analytics is creating a new set of tools for tackling emissions, enabling real-time environmental oversight.

The Carbon Mapper initiative, a not-for-profit coalition leveraging advanced satellite technology, is a prime example of this convergence. By combining NASA JPL's cutting-edge imaging spectrometer with AI-powered analytics, this system can detect and track methane and CO₂ 'superemitters' worldwide with unprecedented precision. This publicly accessible, facility-level data empowers governments, industries and the public to identify leaks and verify emissions reductions rapidly.

AI-enhanced nuclear fission and fusion

Nuclear power, with its ability to provide stable, low-carbon baseload electricity, is a crucial part of the energy mix, particularly as AI and data centre demand surges.

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are a promising innovation aimed at making nuclear power more affordable, flexible and rapidly deployable. AI can be used to optimize the design and engineering of SMRs, significantly shortening construction timelines and potentially lowering capital expenditures. AI also enables advanced modelling and simulation of reactor performance, enhancing safety and efficiency. The recent agreements by tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon to purchase power from nuclear plants underscore the growing recognition of this technology's potential to meet the surging, continuous power demands of data centres.

A collaborative and convergent future

The journey to a greener AI energy future requires more than just isolated innovations. It demands a holistic approach and a collaborative ecosystem. Stakeholders from the technology, energy and government sectors must work together, sharing data and expertise to integrate these solutions seamlessly and addressing systemic challenges, like supply chain readiness and labour availability.

Ultimately, the future of AI and energy is not a zero-sum game. By leveraging technological convergence, we can ensure that AI’s continued growth is not a burden on the planet, but a powerful catalyst for a more sustainable, resilient and equitable energy future.

Wayne County Judge Kevin Cox said the risk was “substantial and compelling” and outweighed the financial harm to Wayne Disposal, a suburban Detroit landfill operated by trash giant Republic Services.

Cox's injunction, signed Tuesday, bars Wayne Disposal from accepting waste from Luckey, Ohio; Middletown, Iowa; Deepwater, New Jersey; Lewiston, New York; and St. Louis.

Those cleanup sites are managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its contractors. The waste includes materials that were produced for weapons, early atomic energy and other uses before and after World War II.

Shipments “have been halted and we are working closely with our contractors to determine the next steps,” Jenn Miller, a spokesperson in the Army Corps environmental division, said Thursday.

Tainted soil in Lewiston is a legacy of the Manhattan Project, the secret government effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II.

While the lawsuit in Michigan was pending, officials recently decided to send Lewiston soil to a Texas landfill to keep the project moving, Miller said.

Wayne Disposal in Van Buren Township, 25 miles west of Detroit, is one of the few landfills in the U.S. that can handle certain hazardous waste.

Republic Services has repeatedly said the landfill meets or exceeds rules to safely manage hazardous materials. The company said the court order was ""overly broad.”

“Responsible management and disposal of these waste streams is an essential need, and Wayne Disposal, Inc. is designed and permitted to safely manage this material,” the company said.

But critics say there are too many homes, schools and waterways near the landfill, making any leak at the site possibly dangerous.

The EAB is still considering whether it has jurisdiction to review the MDE-issued air permit for the Ocean City project.","Ocean City is pursuing every avenue in its ongoing fight to block an offshore wind farm — including one avenue that didn’t appear to exist until a month ago.

That’s when the Environmental Protection Agency told the state that it erred when it said appeals of the air quality permit it granted for the US Wind project could only be challenged in court. The proper venue is the agency’s Environmental Appeals Board (EAB), said the EPA, which ordered the state to rewrite its notice.

State officials refused and have challenged the EPA claim, as has US Wind, the developer behind the Ocean City project. Local environmental attorneys said the move appears to be an attempt by Trump’s EPA to “figure out ways to undercut what the Biden administration did,” by muddying the waters about how an appeal should proceed.

Ocean City’s attorneys “felt that the correct location was the EPA environmental appeals board” and filed its appeal there, said City Manager Terry McGean in a statement. But it filed in Worcester County Circuit Court, too, just in case.

“In order to make sure our appeal was not thrown out based on a procedural issue, we filed in both places. Apparently the EPA agreed with us,” McGean wrote.

It’s the latest twist in a long-running battle over the project, which calls for construction of 121 wind turbines about 10 miles off the Delmarva coast. When complete, the project could generate 2,200 megawatts of energy, enough to power up to 718,000 homes, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

The project has the backing of the Moore administration and the administration of former President Joe Biden (D), which granted a key federal permit for it. But it has long been opposed by some leaders in tourism-dependent Ocean City, who fear the distant turbine towers will harm the view from the beach. Wind projects have another opponent in President Donald Trump (R).

Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit

The EPA appeals board recently took action against a different offshore wind project. In March, the appeals board revoked a Clean Air Act permit issued for New Jersey’s Atlantic Shores wind project during the Biden administration. The board sent the permit back to EPA for a new decision in light of a Trump executive order that paused new wind permitting and leasing, and required federal agencies to reevaluate their policies.

But, critically, that permit was issued by EPA’s Region 2 — not a state agency.

Local environmental attorneys called EPA’s arguments about the Maryland permit unconventional. Typically, a challenge to an air pollution permit issued by MDE would be filed in court in the county where the project is proposed, they said.

“I am a bit baffled by EPA’s assertion,” said Jon Mueller, director of the Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Maryland’s Francis King Carey School of Law, who said the administration may simply be looking for a way to block a Biden-era project.

“I’ve never seen it say you’ve got to go through the EAB before — unless there was some clear statutory requirement,” Mueller said.

In a previous statement to Maryland Matters, an EPA spokesperson criticized Maryland for not complying with its directive to reissue the air permit with instructions for appellants to go to the Environmental Appeals Board.

“They don’t seem to care about complying with legal requirements,” an EPA spokesperson said about MDE.

The appeals board is a three-judge panel that reviews permitting disputes involving federal statutes like the Clean Air Act. Members are appointed by the EPA administrator, to consider appeals on their behalf, but the board is “impartial” and “independent from all other agency components” outside the office of the administrator, according to its website.

The EAB is still considering whether it has jurisdiction to review the MDE-issued air permit for the Ocean City project. In an order issued Monday, the board required the EPA’s general counsel to chime in by Aug. 18.

Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey, regional EPA administrator for the mid-Atlantic, told Maryland on July 7 that it needed to defer to the EAB. That same day, Ocean City filed its appeal with the EAB, making arguments similar argument to Trump’s EPA.

The city’s attorney, Nancie Marzulla, wrote that EPA delegated authority to MDE to issue the Clean Air Act permit, but the federal agency “retains oversight” over the permit, in part because it covers a project on the outer continental shelf, a “federal enclave,” Marzulla wrote.

Both of Ocean City’s filings — in court and before the appeals board — challenge MDE’s construction permit on several grounds, arguing that MDE failed to consider alternatives for the offshore wind project, issued the permit late and relied on uncertain emissions estimates for construction vessels, among other faults.

US Wind believes that the town’s appeal is “less about air quality and more about the very existence of the Project,” wrote Toyja E. Kelley, Sr., an attorney for the company, in a filing before the appeals board. “Be that as it may, Petitioners have a right to challenge the MDE Permit, but only in the forum legally authorized to hear them out: a Maryland Circuit Court.”

Liz Burdock, president and CEO of Oceantic Network, a trade group supporting offshore wind development, agreed with US Wind, saying in a statement that she has “full confidence” in Maryland’s permit — and the state’s appeals process.

MDE “issued the permit for US Wind after a lengthy, well-documented, science-based approach that followed years of precedent and included US EPA Region 3 every step of the way,” Burdock wrote.

In its filing with the EPA board, the Baltimore-based wind developer contended that MDE followed the rules when it issued the air permit. It also argued that the air emissions tied to the project will occur “almost exclusively” during the construction and commissioning phase, thanks to engines aboard construction vessels and diesel generators on the offshore substations before they are connected to the electrical grid.

The turbines themselves “will generate no air emissions,” US Wind wrote, “and in fact will displace electricity that would otherwise be generated by fossil fuel powered sources that have historically created significantly more air emissions.”

In its filing with the appeals board, MDE wrote that EAB lacks jurisdiction based on past precedent, and Ocean City’s petition misconstrues federal law. It warned that an “improvident grant of jurisdiction could result in conflicting judicial rulings given the Petitioners concurrent filing currently proceeding in the Maryland courts.”

Why are farmers so concerned about solar legislation passed in Maryland this year?

Phil Federico, a Maryland environmental attorney who handles class action suits related to groundwater and air pollution, said he also found it strange that EPA was arguing the wind permit should go to its appeals board.

“It’s a novel argument,” Federico said. “And I think they’re relying heavily on the fact that the Clean Air Act permits the EPA to delegate authority to the state to issue Clean Air Act permits.”

Federico said it seems as though the federal agency, having already delegated authority to Maryland to enact Clean Air Act permits on the outer continental shelf, is now moving the goalposts.

“If you’re going to delegate this authority to MDE, and they do issue a Clean Air Act permit consistent with the EPA standards, then I don’t see the problem,” Federico said. “My guess is this is probably — to some degree — being impacted by political preference.”

In its filing, MDE also argued that many of Ocean City’s contentions were not brought forward during the public comment period, making them ineligible subjects for an appeal.

The state still countered each deficiency cited by Ocean City, arguing that it was allowed to rely on previous alternative analyses conducted by the U.S. Department of the Interior, that its vessel emissions estimates were sound and that the permit underwent ample public comment.

Responding to the contention that the appeals board should overturn the permit because it was issued after a statutory deadline, MDE argued that would be an “absurd” remedy, since the deadline was set to protect permit applicants from a never-ending review process.

“A contrary ruling would allow an agency to avoid ever having to make a decision,” reads MDE’s filing.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-30-at-5.53.33-PM-2048x1364.png,N,,2025-08-08 13:07:03.639570

Recently, they have taken steps to move away from the production of electric vehicles and focus on artificial intelligence (AI) servers. The Register believes that the pause in the automotive industry and the increase in AI server production is a great response to the current market. In this context, Tesla is also planning to revamp its artificial intelligence production. Read on to find out all the details.

Taiwanese contract manufacturing giant Foxconn

Taiwanese contract manufacturing giant Foxconn has sold its US electric vehicle factory and will use the land to create AI servers as a substitute.

A Monday filing presented the sale of the facility in Lordstown, Ohio, which Foxconn acquired from startup Lordstown Motors in 2022, and that the company will keep to operate on the site and get to other activities.

According to Japanese outlet Nikkei, Foxconn sold the plant as it feels the North American electric vehicle market is soft as production capacity exceeds demand, and the company wants to miliorates its capacity to manufacture AI servers in the USA. The Wall Street Journal also reported the change to server production at the Ohio site.

New of the sale: July 30 annoucement

News of the sale came just days after the July 30 announcement that Foxconn come into a strategic alliance with Taiwanese company TECO Electric & Machinery designed to aim the two companies pursue AI datacenter business worldwide.

TECO makes energy infrastructure required to build datacenters, and Foxconn makes not all its customers want, which is usually servers and other datacenter hardware.

Foxconn has already settled to increase its US presence so it can make AI hardware for Apple and other local customers. Flipping the Lordstown plant from EVs to AI therefore advances the Taiwanese company’s AI ambitions.

However, the company has also promised to build an electric vehicle reference platform so it can reach work from automakers.

The future of that plan is at this time not clear at all. But Foxconn has form walking away from big plans, as occured when it failed to deliver on a promise to build a giant LCD display manufacturing plant in Wisconsin.

Foxconn change: all you must know

LCD displays aren’t a popular market today. Foxconn’s modification is, nevertheless, very much in the same point with Trump administration policies that motivates foreign companies moving production to the USA and finished tax credits for buying electric vehicles. The administration also just presented a laissez faire AI policy thought to spark datacenter construction.

In addition, on Monday, EV-maker Tesla’s board announced the interim award of 96 million shares to CEO Elon Musk.

In a letter to shareholders the Board justified the award due to the fact of “Retaining Elon is more relevant than ever before” as the company shifts from being “a reference in the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to increase towards turning into a leader in AI, robotics and related services.”

Foxconn agrees $375 million Lordstown plant sale to pivot towards data centers

Foxconn purchased the plant, a former General Motors (GM.N), opens new tab small-car factory named after the town in Ohio where it is located, in 2022 from now-bankrupt U.S. electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors Corp for $230 million, as part of its efforts to expand into EVs.

Foxconn also invested in Lordstown and the companies started making electric pickup trucks there. But the partnership later soured, with Lordstown going out of business and suing Foxconn.

Foxconn said on Monday it sold the factory to an “existing business partner”, without giving details.

It also said the company remained committed to automotive customers in the U.S. and said it would be able to rapidly ramp up automotive production to meet customer demand when required.",https://www.blanquivioletas.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tesla-white.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 14:01:41.918359

Natural disasters like storms and wildfires present key operating and financial risks for utilities and their shareholders. And while the damage is severe to both individuals and utilities, many utilities also anticipate record-breaking peak energy demand from new data centers, manufacturing, and electrification, along with increased customer usage.

The Morningstar US Utilities Index is up 19% this year to date and up 72% from its bottom in late 2023, handily beating the US market. This has limited the attractive long-term buying opportunities among US utilities, but there are still utilities that offer well-supported capital investment plans, good earnings growth, and appealing stock valuations.

Our new report, US Utilities: Searching for Summer Deals, explains how disaster response efforts can lead to investments in clean energy, reliability, safety, and resiliency, and provide important growth opportunities for utilities and investors.

Key Takeaways

Climate change concerns and energy demand growth are boosting utilities’ growth investments in clean energy, safety, reliability, and resiliency.

The Southern California fires in January spooked many investors going into the traditional summer wildfire season. We think the market has overreacted, offering some attractive values.

The May National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast suggests a more active season than normal with 13-19 named storms. Watch for opportunities to buy high-quality utilities in the Southeast US at better prices.

Florida, Carolina, and Louisiana utilities remain best-in-class in storm cost recovery. Look for utilities to propose storm-hardening investments that could support higher earnings growth.

Disasters and Demand: Investing in Reliability

Utilities with regulated, mostly fixed customer rates face a significant near-term earnings impact when severe weather strikes.

Regulators often allow utilities to recover those costs through future customer rate increases, but the cash flow timing lag can stretch for years, raising financing costs and slowing earnings and dividend growth.

Regulators in some states deny full storm cost recovery if they determine the utility was too slow to restore services. However, regulators typically stop short of penalties, issuing fines, or other customer rate changes that would create significant credit risk.

Utilities’ valuations remain elevated. Headline-grabbing forecasts drive this fervor, with robust earnings expectations tied to skyrocketing data center growth and reliability investment needs. Many utilities have large investment growth plans that focus on serving new demand with reliable, clean energy. However, many of these stocks trade at premium valuations.

We think the market is overlooking other utilities with cheaper valuations but with similar investment growth plans that can produce at least 6% annual earnings growth.

Wildfires: Are West Coast Utilities Investable?

Within California, the service territories for all three investor-owned utilities—PG&E, Edison International, and Sempra Energy—cover areas with high wildfire risk. The wildfires experienced in 2017 and 2018 were by far the most damaging in US history, and liabilities related to these wildfires led PG&E to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2019.

Since PG&E’s bankruptcy, a number of initiatives have worked to protect investors:

Assembly Bill 1054 aimed to restore PG&E’s financial health and support utilities’ investment-grade credit ratings.

The California Wildfire Fund now reimburses utilities for claims exceeding USD $1 billion from a wildfire caused by a utility’s equipment if regulators determine the utility is a prudent operator, like other states’ standard.

California utilities have also implemented or accelerated wildfire mitigation initiatives, including enhanced vegetation management; more investment in system hardening; and public safety power shutoffs on days of high fire risk.

The state is emphasizing electrification to meet its environmental goals while maintaining reliability, safety, and affordability. For California’s electric utilities, this can offer sector-leading growth opportunities.

Because half PG&E’s service territory has been designated a high fire threat by California regulators, the utility receives political and regulatory support to dedicate large-growth investments in wildfire mitigation. Some of these investments include: underground power lines, system upgrades, additional weather stations and drone inspections, and vegetation management.

Hurricanes: Manageable Natural Disaster Risk

Utilities with larger footprints in states with high hurricane probability (Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina) are at greater risk of incurring restoration expenses. However, utilities, on average, have shown a strong track record for managing hurricanes’ customer impact, creating regulatory goodwill.

While investors have become comfortable with most utilities’ ability to handle severe weather, hurricanes result in high restoration costs and increased regulatory risk for recovery of those restoration costs. Utilities’ restoration efforts sometimes also fail to meet stakeholder expectations.",https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/lTi7nTKOKdyBxuR4i9bdbvLKjII=/2400x1350/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/PIT5C7O7WFCLTITAJZ4HTDS22A.png,N,,2025-08-08 14:01:57.687091

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites.
But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.","The current Trump administration has made 70% more changes to government environmental websites during its first 100 days than the first Trump administration did, and those changes are bolder, according to a report published by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI).

EDGI is a nonprofit network of researchers who work with data, started after President Trump took office in 2017. It documents loss of access and usability of government environmental information and preserves that information for public use.

The group found that in the first 100 days of the first Trump administration, there were 371 important changes made to websites, while in the same period this year there were 632 changes. EDGI defined an important change as significantly altering the content, focus or links on a page.

The increase was observed even though EDGI started the second Trump term with fewer volunteers and was monitoring fewer pages — 4,429 this year versus more than 25,000 in 2017. In preparing the report, EDGI says members of its network monitored government web pages. Then they made publicly available the information they preserved and the criteria they used to monitor those federal web sites.

""I am surprised by the extent of the removal of information about environmental justice,"" says Gretchen Gehrke, co-founder of EDGI. ""That level of total erasure we didn't see with any topic under the first-term administration.""

The EDGI report shows the administration's biggest targets included diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and environmental justice — the idea that everyone, regardless of their background, has the right to a healthy environment and to participate in environmental decisions. Trump signed an executive order on January 20 eliminating programs, offices and positions related to both issues. That was after former President Biden made environmental justice a central goal for his administration.

""Under President Trump's leadership, agencies are refocusing on their core missions and shifting away from ideological activism,"" Taylor Rogers, White House assistant press secretary, wrote in an email to NPR.

The EDGI report says that the effort to take down websites began the day after Trump took office in January. The Council on Environmental Quality's Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was removed, along with nine similar screening tools at other agencies within the next month. Those tools identified disadvantaged communities in order to fulfill a Biden administration goal of ensuring that 40% of climate program benefits went to them.

The report found climate change information has also been altered or removed from federal websites, though less consistently than environmental justice and DEI sites. The federal climate change research website globalchange.gov was shut down. But the EPA's primary climate change website remains intact, with links to scientific information and advice for what individuals can do about climate change.

A widely used National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) site, climate.gov, stopped publishing new content this summer, after the staff of 10 people who contributed to it was terminated. The site published information about changing weather patterns, drought conditions and greenhouse gas emissions and had received nearly one million visitors every month.

The “Solar for All” program was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribal groups, regions and nonprofits under the Biden administration’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27-billion program geared toward addressing climate change.

The Solar for All funds would have delivered residential solar projects to more than 900,000 households nationwide.

In a post on X, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the program as a boondoggle in which not enough was actually going for solar projects.

“One of the more shocking features of Solar For All was with regards to the massive dilution of the money, as many grants go through pass-through after pass-through after pass-through after pass-through with all of the middlemen taking their own cut — at least 15% by conservative estimates,” Zeldin said. “What a grift.

“With clear language and intent from Congress in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ EPA is taking action to end this program for good,” Zeldin added, referring to President Trump’s tax and spending bill he recently signed into law.

Solar energy is widely considered one of the best ways to address climate change, by eliminating emissions that come from burning coal or natural gas to make electricity. This week, Los Angeles celebrated the opening of one of the nation’s largest solar and battery power plants, the Eland facility in Kern County, which is now supplying 7% of the city’s power.

California is home to multiple projects that received funding from the Solar for All program, according to the federal project database.

They include a $250-million award for California’s Solar for All program, intended to fund solar initiatives statewide. The California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency were going to oversee and distribute the grant funds, which were particularly focused on low-income and disadvantaged communities and California tribes.

In a joint statement, the three agencies said the EPA’s termination of Solar for All funding “needlessly increases the cost of community solar and storage projects in California and damages California’s efforts to unleash innovation, train people for today’s energy jobs, and build clean energy projects.”

Two nonprofits — the Community Power Coalition and GRID Alternatives — each had $250-million awards for separate efforts to develop community solar and multifamily solar projects across several states, including in California.

Environmental groups were outraged by the announcement. Estimates were that the program would have saved low-income households $400 a year on electricity bills, created more than 200,000 jobs and eliminated more than 30 million metric tons of air pollution, according to the nonprofit Climate Power.

“This is a deliberate choice to make life harder for working Americans,” Alex Glass, Climate Power’s communications director, said in a statement. “The Trump administration isn’t just walking away from climate solutions — they’re ripping affordable energy away from the families who need it most.”

Trump — who received record donations from fossil fuel companies during his 2024 presidential campaign — is making a number of efforts to slow the transition to clean energy while encouraging the use of fossil fuels, including canceling credits for solar and wind projects by the end of 2027. The president has said these efforts will help save taxpayers money and strengthen American energy independence.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, denounced the EPA’s decision to cancel the program as illegal. The funding for the program had already been fully obligated and contracts for all recipients were signed, he said.

“This latest heist from the Trump administration will cause energy costs to rise, keep Americans beholden to monopolistic electric utilities, and make our grid overburdened and less reliable,” Markey said in a statement. “Trump and Zeldin’s attacks on the Solar for All program and their attempts to cancel legally-binding contracts will mean energy bills are going to continue to spike nationwide.”

The program would have created more than $8 billion in overall savings across all 50 states, Markey said.

Officials with California’s Solar for All program said similarly that the EPA’s decision is unlawful and urged the agency to reverse the program’s termination. The state was already well underway in implementing its grant after the funding was made available in March, they said.

“Congress appropriated these funds with a clear mandate,” the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Energy Commission and the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency said in their joint statement. “Revoking them now undermines our legal system and destabilizes ongoing projects.”

The Environmental Protection Network, composed of more than 600 former EPA employees, described the decision as an “abrupt and arbitrary” betrayal of public health, environmental justice and economic opportunity.

“Communities promised relief from punishing energy costs are now left in the dark,” former EPA senior advisor Zealan Hoover said in a statement. “Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0bf0823/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffa%2F98%2F8b299b814dd093ef7d9fc9df61c8%2F1514013-me-archdiocese-habitat-for-humanity-15-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 12:09:28.215957

Contact: Ashley Sullivan, ashley.sullivan@weact.org, 1 (917) 837 – 1183

WASHINGTON – This week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced their intention to terminate all 60 grants already awarded under the $7 billion Solar for All program. Under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), the Solar for All program would have delivered low cost, clean, renewable energy to more than 900,000 lower-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. This would have helped cut pollution, improve energy affordability, create good quality jobs, and make communities more climate resilient. The cancellation represents another piece of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration’s EPA to reverse progress at the expense of already overburdened and under-resourced communities.

One in three people across the U.S. struggle to pay energy bills. Low-income, Black, Hispanic, and disadvantaged households already spend a greater amount of their income on energy bills, and are more exposed to greater air pollution from fossil fuel energy production as well as growing extreme heat. Solar for All investments are a win-win for everyone, as they are intended to cut household electricity costs by 20 percent, with the goal to lower electricity bills for participating households by $400 each year. This program answers all of these public health and energy concerns with tangible outcomes as seen in Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada.

WE ACT for Environmental Justice, in coalition with partners including the Equitable and Just National Climate Forum, strongly supported the creation of the GGRF as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. This investment would not have been possible without the firm advocacy of countless environmental justice groups and communities from across the U.S.

Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy at WE ACT for Environmental Justice shared,

“ Cutting the popular and transformational Solar for All program is yet another attack on environmental justice and progress. It strips billions of dollars from a program designed to deliver clean, affordable energy to low-income and communities of color—communities already burdened by pollution, high energy costs, and systemic neglect. This decision is part of the administration’s efforts to move us backwards and will perpetuate environmental racism, deepen health disparities, and it betrays the EPA’s mission to protect people and the environment.”

The comments, responding to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2026-2027 plan for biofuel blending obligations under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), call on the agency to swiftly finalize strong volumes while protecting against small refinery exemptions (SREs) that could undercut anticipated benefits to drivers, farmers, and rural communities

“The Trump administration has laid out an ambitious course that will unlock new investment, increase U.S. energy production, and provide reliable markets for our farmers,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “We urge EPA to stand strong on the president’s vision and swiftly finalize the proposed volumes. At the same time, we recognize that a minority of refiners continue to demand special exemptions that would destroy the very demand this proposal is intended to deliver. The EPA has indicated that they intend to fully account for any lost gallons from 2026 and 2027 exemptions. Maintaining that approach will send a clear signal that producers and farmers can count on this EPA to ensure the promised volumes actually reach the marketplace.”

As part of their written submission, Growth Energy will also call on EPA to:

Continue to grow the RFS to help drive further investment in higher ethanol blends such as E15 and E85.

Minimize refinery exemptions to those small refineries that can fully demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship.

Finalize the proposal on E15 labeling and infrastructure.

In 2020, Arizona Public Service committed to obtaining 65% of its energy from “clean” sources by 2030, with 45% of its power generation coming from renewable sources, like solar and wind.

By 2050, APS officials said the utility would use 100% clean energy, or sources of electricity that do not produce greenhouse gases, which includes nuclear.

That all changed this week.

On a quarterly call with investors, APS CEO Ted Geisler said the utility is getting rid of those targets as it announced new investments in natural gas.

Today, Arizona as a whole gets about 54% of its electricity generation from clean sources and around 30% from renewable sources, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

What drove the change?

On the investor call, Geisler said APS made the changes to ensure reliable service for customers “as Arizona continues to grow at unprecedented levels.”

Critics say the change in policy sends a bad message to Arizonans.

“Having the goals in place was important because it indicated to APS rate payers, the investors and the public at large that the utility had a commitment to doing something to reduce emissions that contribute to climate change and to get more and more of its electricity from renewable energy sources,” said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter.

APS officials did not agree to an interview for this story, but others who support the change argued it is needed to adapt to supply Arizona with the electricity needed to meet a growth in both population and energy-intensive industries like data centers.

Republican Kevin Thompson, who chairs the Arizona Corporation Commission that regulates utilities like APS, said the old clean energy goals were outdated.

“They were made at a time during a different commission that don't really reflect Arizona's current challenges, which is why I don't think politics should be involved in setting these arbitrary goals, like what APS has set,” Thompson said.

Thompson said renewable sources like solar should continue to be part of APS’ larger energy portfolio.

“But I think the idea that you can meet the needs of tomorrow without reliable generation is just irresponsible, and I think the utilities are seeing that now,” he said.

Thompson said the grid needs sources of energy like natural gas to provide that reliability.

“And I think it's a fallacy to think that renewables are the answer, end all be all,” he said. “I think you have to have that baseload, reliable, dispatchable generation.”

APS is also extending the life of its Four Corners Coal plant.

But Mike Philipsen, an APS spokesman, said APS now plans to get out of coal “no later than 2038.”

That contradicts the company’s previous commitment to close the plant by 2031.

And critics say it goes against comments APS officials made last year as they successfully lobbied for a new state law they said was needed to finance the move away from coal.

“APS fought tooth and nail for a securitization tool they clearly do not intend to use,” said Autumn Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association. “They are signaling not just delay, but abandonment of the entire transition.”

What’s the best mix?

But renewable energy advocates reject the argument that the energy can’t be dispatchable, which refers to sources that can be turned on and off to meet fluctuating demand.

Johnson said the state could accomplish this by increasing all types of renewable and clean energy sources, including solar and wind, while investigating emerging technologies in nuclear and battery storage.

That would help further diversify the state’s grid, which currently gets about half of its electricity from natural gas.

“So I don't think anybody is talking about just having one resource. I think we're talking about dividing up the pie a little bit more equally,” Johnson said.

Bahr, the Sierra Club director in Arizona, said that could be good for ratepayers, too.

“I care deeply about the air pollution, the water pollution, how much water they use, and climate change, but these coal plants are bad for ratepayers,” Bahr said. “And no one has to take my word for that on that — they can look at APS own numbers.”

Some studies have shown that renewable energy farms in the U.S. are much more economical than coal plants, the Guardian reported.

Thompson said at least some of that economic viability was driven by federal subsidies under the Biden administration, which Trump is rolling back, supporting solar and other clean energies.

“There was this huge influx of cash into the renewable arena and really kind of pushed those over the limit of really making them affordable,” Thompson said.

Thompson did acknowledge most energy generation projects receive subsidies in one form or another.

And financial services firm Lazard recently found that wind and solar “remain the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis.”

Politics

Bahr argued it is politics, not grid reliability, that drove APS’ decision.

“I feel like this decision is political, and taking advantage, again, of a time when the Trump administration is trying to roll back all of the protections that we have relative to climate,” Bahr said.

She pointed to President Donald Trump’s well-known dislike for renewables and executive orders designed to boost the domestic coal industry.

Bahr claimed that’s why APS decided to keep Four Corners online, though the utility gave a different explanation.

“In short, coal is an important part of our balanced energy mix today, and we will not exit it any earlier than is in the best interests of our customers to ensure reliable service at the lowest cost possible,” Philipsen, the APS spokesman, said. “It’s also worth noting that coal is an important economic engine for the Navajo Nation, which has an ownership interest in the plant.”

Bahr claimed that Arizona’s utility regulators are too deferential to utilities.

She pointed out that APS is removing its clean energy goals even though it included them in past resource planning documents filed with regulators on the Corporation Commission.

The all-Republican Corporation Commission is preparing to finalize its own policy change to remove a rule that requires Arizona utilities to use 15% renewable energy by 2026.

Thompson, who has vocally supported Trump’s energy agenda, denied Bahr’s claims.

“We shouldn't be injecting politics into keeping the grid reliable and affordable,” he said.

What’s next

According to APS, it is jettisoning its plan to go 100% clean by 2050 in favor of adopting “an aspirational ‘carbon-neutral’ approach by 2050.” Unlike the commitment to use 100% clean energy, a carbon-neutral pledge means a company will attempt to offset its emissions.

Companies with carbon-neutral policies can use technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or pay for “carbon credits,” which allow companies to essentially pay for offsets by investing in things like reforestation efforts that are supposed to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1441289/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7793x4091+0+552/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F43%2Fab%2F38e3008a482d8bb120274d82d78d%2Faps-ocotillo-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 12:09:32.050705

It comes from a sprawling conglomerate of giant rectangular, windowless buildings. Many are visible from the streets, with a few tactfully concealed from neighborhood view. When they aren’t marked, the average person might not know what they’re looking at: data centers. A lot of them.

This is Data Center Alley, located in and around Ashburn, Virginia. It’s the main data center hub in a state that’s home to around 300 of the facilities.

Northern Virginia has roughly 35% of the world’s data centers.

Virginia may be the data center capital of the world, but it’s not the only hotspot. Similar facilities are popping up in Georgia, Tennessee, and other states across the South.

Data centers require massive amounts of energy to operate. Although some tech companies have made commitments to powering the facilities with renewable resources, many are instead relying on electricity produced from methane gas.

Methane has over 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide for its first 20 years in the atmosphere. Utilities try to brand it as clean, “natural” gas, but methane is really a dangerous fossil fuel and super pollutant responsible for a third of the warming from greenhouse gases.

Data centers play an important role in how we use the internet, but it’s important to power them sustainably.

As a new report shows, much of the projected data center demand is speculative — if not outright implausible.

What’s the risk in that? Monopoly utilities build new gas plants, and gas companies build pipelines and wells to meet demand that isn’t really there, leaving Southern communities to pay the price.

Existing and Proposed Data Centers in the Southeast

View Resource

What are data centers?

Since the early 2000s, data centers have been used to house computing machines and hardware for storing, processing, and distributing digital information.

The U.S. is home to the most data centers in the world, with thousands of data center facilities across the country. Many are expanding across the South.

These facilities are used for online activities varying from things like file storage and processing online transactions.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) computing has become the fastest-growing segment of data center power demand.

The energy impact of AI is significant: a single ChatGPT query requires almost 10 times as much energy as a single Google search.

Increasing power demands amid regulatory rollbacks

Electricity demand from data centers around the world is predicted to double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). AI is expected to be the primary driver behind the increase – the IEA predicts demand from AI-optimized data centers will quadruple in the next five years.

The Trump administration has been taking its own actions to promote the growth while reducing pollution protections:

President Trump has a plan to invest at least $500 billion in data centers and AI over the next four years.

In January, the Trump administration declared the U.S. was in a national energy emergency from inadequate energy supply. A few days later, President Trump signed an Executive Order establishing the U.S.’s commitment to becoming a national leader in AI.

As the Trump administration promotes AI development, they’ve also been halting plans focused on cleaner, renewable resources – including solar and wind – that could help meet energy demands.

The EPA has repealed rules that enforced coal plant pollution limits. Recently, the organization also proposed repealing updates to the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule and Carbon Pollution Standards – all of which will allow power plants to continue polluting our air.

The EPA proposed to repeal the “endangerment finding,” which declared greenhouse gases as a danger to public health, forfeiting its legal authority to limit climate pollution.

We’re in the midst of a massive methane gas buildout, which Daniel Brookshire, SELC’s energy utility and policy analyst, says is coming as demand increases and utilities retire older coal plants in favor of new methane infrastructure.

Monopoly utilities in the South are rushing to build 43,000 megawatts of methane gas plants over the next 15 years.

“Just to put that in perspective, 1,000 megawatts is close to the size of just one nuclear power plant,” Brookshire said. “We’re talking about 40 of those.”

New analysis reveals implausible data center projections:

A new report commissioned by SELC from London Economics International (LEI) shines a light on the upward bias prevalent in data center electricity demand estimates.

Chip supply shortage:

The report reveals that projected data center energy demand through 2030, from just 77% of the U.S. market, would require 90% of the global chip supply. In other words, things aren’t adding up: the current demand projections for data centers are implausible to actually build.

“These findings underscore a critical and ongoing concern: inflated and speculative data center electricity demand forecasts in the Southeast are driving a dramatic and unnecessary overbuild of infrastructure that threatens to lock in fossil fuels, hike energy bills, and crowd out more reliable, cost-effective clean energy,” SELC Senior Attorney Megan Gibson said. “Such speculative infrastructure investment creates significant economic risks for individuals, who ultimately bear the financial burdens in higher utility bills and high costs of accelerating climate disasters.”

Repeated, redundant requests:

Companies are submitting extra requests to build more centers because they know most of the proposals won’t get realized. When there are 5-10 times more requests than actual centers being built, it’s difficult for regulators to plan, manage cost concerns, and leave room for sustainable infrastructure.

It’s possible to construct data centers without such an intense strain on our energy resources. But too many companies rely on utilities that use the projected growth to justify costly, dangerous methane buildouts, stopping progress before it can even properly start.

What does this mean for the people of the South?

When data center demand is used to justify a massive methane gas build out, Southern consumers will pay – with their wallets and their health.

Polluted communities

Brookshire says with this huge shift to methane gas, leaks at pipelines and fracking sites are inevitable.

“Methane escaping is really bad,” he said. “Even little leakage rates can sometimes offset any climate benefit that gas might have over coal.”

Here’s what we know about methane gas leaks:

A study from John Hopkins University found that methane gas leakage from pipelines emits four times as much methane as current national estimates suggest.

Methane gas power plants and compressor stations threaten surrounding communities — often communities of color who have already borne the brunt of harm from industrial facilities for decades — with dangerous air pollution. This includes pollutants like fine particulates and formaldehyde which are harmful even at very low levels.

Along with lowering air quality for locals, gas leaks can impact people even across state borders and pipeline infrastructure can be dangerous beyond public health and are prone to explosions.

Unpredictable prices

Methane comes with financial risks, too. Gas pricing, Brookshire says, is extremely volatile. As utilities profit from over-reliance on methane, prices increase because of a shortage of necessary infrastructure materials.

These utilities, they pass the full cost of all their fuel resources straight on to customers. There’s no risk in our region of utility shareholders or the company itself bearing the costs of the fuel.

Daniel Brookshire, Energy Utility and Policy Analyst

It doesn’t have to be like this

There are ways to take the strain off the growing energy demand from data centers. Some corporations are already realizing that we don’t need dirty methane to power our lives.

Renewable energy resources like solar and wind are strong alternatives to methane. They’re cost-effective – a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) finds that 90% of renewable resources worldwide are cheaper than fossil fuels. They’re better for our communities and climate while also being predictable, so consumers don’t need to worry about volatile pricing shifts.

You can really store that renewable energy for when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing to use it.

Daniel Brookshire, SELC

We’re already seeing change across our region:

In Virginia, the nation’s largest offshore wind project is advancing with the intent of powering at least 660,000 homes when it’s complete.

Silicon Ranch, a solar company based in Tennessee, is collaborating with the data center planning company Tract to develop greener hyperscale data center campuses.

Residents can take matters into their own hands, like the community of rural Pittsylvania County, Virginia, did when they were able to block an enormous data center complex and power plant.

The LEI report reveals how difficult it is to accurately predict how many data centers will come to fruition. But data centers are going to keep developing across the South – we still have a chance to ensure they’re being powered in sustainable ways.

Many of the largest data center companies have made strong commitments to power their systems with clean, renewable energy. As the impacts of climate change intensify and energy demands increase, it’s critical that we hold them, and our Southern utilities, to those standards.

Nobody voted for pipelines in their backyards, methane gas leaking into their neighborhoods, or regulated monopolies profiting at their expense. As data center growth surges and utilities prepare to expand, Southern communities get the short end of the stick.",https://www.selc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DataCenters2_1248x936.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 12:13:48.568175

Sorensen: Yeah, I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, and I grew up afraid of storms; I grew up afraid of, of tornadoes, right? And I just had this intense reaction every time they occurred, and I wanted to learn more. I’ll never forget—I thought it was a punishment when my mom and dad took me to the library. They were like, “All right, we need to get Eric to learn more about weather.” [Laughs] Right? And so I’m just, like—as I started learning about it, I was hooked on it as a kid, and so all I wanted to be was the meteorologist on TV, and you know what? I got to do that for 22 years, and it was, like, it was awesome.

Feltman: Yeah, so then what got you into politics?

Sorensen: So, you know, I’ll tell you: a lot of different things. I was somebody who worked in my hometown of Rockford, Illinois, and aside from working in the district that I now serve in the Congress, I worked for a couple of years in Texas, and I am a believer and a lover of science. Everything that I do, I’m, I’m thinking about, “What is a scientific angle?” to whatever we do. And I’m sitting in the weather center, I’m forecasting the weather, at WQAD-TV in the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa.

[CLIP: Eric Sorensen delivering a weather forecast on WQAD-TV: “Hi there, everybody, meteorologist Eric Sorensen of the Storm Track 8 Weather Center ...”]

Sorensen: And the top story was: our congresswoman Cheri Bustos announced that she was retiring. And the news anchors across the studio from me, they pointed at me, and they’re like, “You need to do that.” I’m like, “I don’t wanna be a politician. That’s stupid. That is the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard,” right?

I honestly was watching the ceiling fan go around, trying to go to sleep that night, and I thought to myself, “Why wouldn’t I do that?” Right?

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: We were going through a pandemic, where we didn’t have enough communicators of science. As we were understanding it, as we were learning it, we needed to communicate it. We only had one Anthony Fauci; we needed 10,000 of him.

Feltman: Yeah.

Sorensen: And so I realized that it wasn’t so much just meteorology but just by being there for people every day and really being trusted, it was the recipe for being elected to Congress. Because I’m gonna tell you, I was a total nerd in school—I would not have been elected the treasurer of my high school class—but the first time I ran for Congress, I won.

Feltman: And how has your background informed how you operate as a politician, and I’m also curious, you know, how has your introduction to politics influenced you as a science communicator?

Sorensen: Well, look, I thought I was just going to go to the Congress and be the communicator of climate.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: I thought that that’s going to be the lane that I need to travel as a meteorologist, okay? And, and for—in many instances that’s what I do. But then, to be an outsider elected to Congress, it’s a unique perspective, right, because nobody communicates well there at all; we don’t communicate any of the s— that people need to know about.

And so, like, I get there, and I realize, “Oh, wait a minute, Congress has an approval rating of what, like, 20 percent”—something like that—“for good reason,” right? Because nobody there is doing a good job of communicating back home that they’re doing their jobs or that they’re connecting with people or creating these solutions. And then, for me, I will tell you, one of the things that has helped is: I don’t have a background in politics, right?

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: If my background is in science and communicating science, I have to challenge people on the other side of the aisle a lot, but ...

Feltman: Sure.

Sorensen: They’re not afraid to work with me, you know ...

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: When we need to do some important things.

Feltman: And what have some of your biggest accomplishments been since you were elected?

Sorensen: I’ll tell you, in the first Congress one of the things that—it’s not necessarily related to science—but it was making sure that we passed the All-American Flag Act. It sounds really minuscule, but I’m like, the federal government spends a lot of money on flags, and they should be made in America, by American fibers ...

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: And making sure that the grommets are made in America. It is something simple-sounding, but it was really hard to get through the Congress, and people had been trying to do that, and I was able to do that.

Now, I’ll tell you, things have changed in this Congress, you know, as you have President Trump that decides that he’s gonna go after and DOGE go—goes after the National Weather Service and how important these things are and how important the science of understanding climate is. As he goes after it I am the pushback, right?

Feltman: Right.

Sorensen: I’m leading that pushback to make sure that we’re going to stand up for science and stand up for meteorology and climatology.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and I would love to talk a little bit more about that—you know, what, what have you and your colleagues been doing in response to these attacks on the National Weather Service?

Sorensen: I didn’t think that I was gonna have to argue the importance of the weather service, but, you know, I’m so glad that I’m here, right?

And then it was finding members on the other side of the aisle that understand the importance of it. So Congressman ...

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: Mike Flood, he’s a Republican out in eastern Nebraska—also, I wanna say, as a meteorologist, I have to work with a guy named Mike Flood [laughs]. I’m just like—I have to.

Feltman: [Laughs] Sure, yeah.

Sorensen: Right? And so he—like, in eastern Nebraska they get a lot of tornadoes ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Sorensen: And so we put forth a bill and we’re championing a bill through the Congress that says that National Weather Service employees are essential and that we need to hire them back. And we’re seeing success: we’re seeing that the Trump administration is turning, and now NOAA is able to hire these people back.

I’m working with Congressman Nathaniel Moran. This congressman is in the reddest part of Texas, but also it’s Tyler, Texas—it’s the only place that I worked outside of Illinois—so we have this, like, common bond ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: ’Cause I worked at KLTV. And so it’s: “How are we getting the important weather information to rural America?”

Feltman: Right.

Sorensen: And we started working on that before the tragedy happened in Texas. And so it’s: “How can we make better policy that is not just going to be reactionary when we have these climate-fueled disasters?” It’s: “How are we going to be up front, before they occur?”

Feltman: Yeah, and do you think that your colleagues in Washington in general and the administration specifically, do you think most of them understand the breadth of what the National Weather Service does and how important it is?

Sorensen: The tragedy that occurred in Texas, that’s in Chip Roy’s district ...

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: He is one of the most conservative Republican members. So he understands the value of it. He’s not coming out against this now ...

Feltman: Right.

Sorsensen: Because it happened to him. Tornado Alley: Oklahoma and Kansas and Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi and Alabama—these are all red states. Or if you look at these hurricane-prone states, much the same: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida—they’re red states, right? So we can’t politicize the science of meteorology.

Feltman: Right ...

Sorensen: And I, I would even go even farther than that: to say we should never politicize climatology either.

Feltman: Yeah, and speaking of the politicization of climatology we were just talking on the show recently about the push to pull back the endangerment finding and the report that doesn’t just seem to attack the endangerment finding specifically but does a lot of undermining the basic, accepted science of climate change. What are your thoughts on that? You know, what do you think that Congress and other elected reps can do about that situation?

Sorensen: Well, I think, it’s fascinating to me—the far right, they’re trying to make it more mainstream, that they want people to believe that somehow there’s climate modification going on, or that there’s some sinister—like, airplanes are spraying chemicals into the air and there are all of these nefarious reasons for what you’re seeing, as opposed to understanding the basic climate science that says that humans are causing it but in a different way. Why is it that some people are so susceptible to believing conspiracy theory, yet they won’t believe the actual science?

The science is pretty easy: that we can identify the carbon in the atmosphere to know that carbon occurred because we were burning fossil fuels. We understand these are basic principles of atmospheric science. We know that CO2 is the number one driver of global warming. Yet we don’t do anything about it.

And I will even say, as we are recording this, I’ve got an air-quality alert in ...

Feltman: Right.

Sorensen: My part of northwestern Illinois. And we had—forgive me; I use hand gestures when I talk about the weather—we had a cold front come through the area, and now we’re seeing a northerly wind, and that northerly wind is coming off of wildfires in northern Ontario.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: Let’s understand why this is occurring now versus before ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: Because now we’ve pushed the jet stream so far to the north that the thunderstorms that are producing the cloud-to-ground lightning, okay, they used to happen in the Prairie provinces, right? They used to happen where Canada had fire departments because there’s highways, right? We can go ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: And fight them. But now the jet stream is so far to the north that the cloud-to-ground lightning is hitting in forests that are hundreds of miles away from civilization. And so there’s no way for those to go out.

And as a meteorologist, but also as a congressman, I’m communicating to the people here that what you’re seeing with these air-quality alerts—we had the worst air quality in the world the other day—this is the new norm. This is the new norm ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Sorensen: Because we have changed the climate so much, and I don’t know—no one knows—what are the health ramifications for how we’ve changed it? That’s something that we’re gonna know, unfortunately, decades from now.

Feltman: Yeah. What issues are you most concerned about right now when it comes to weather and the climate, and what sort of projects and enterprises are you excited about?

Sorensen: So, look, I worry that we may have people become apathetic ...

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: When it comes to the climate crisis. I wish that we would’ve done more. I wish that we had curbed our emissions, that we had done that in the past 10, 20 years, when we understood it, as opposed to just arguing over it. One of my motivations is to be the science guy, the meteorologist that’s not afraid to work in the middle of the aisle to be able to get people to understand that we need to move this forward; we need to make sure that we’re innovating, that we’re sustaining the next generation— also, that it’s smart to do right by the next generation.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: Let’s talk about those things. So I do worry that as I am finding movement to move forward in the center of the aisle—even in a Trump administration it is occurring, right ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: I worry that as I move people forward we’re gonna lose the people that are maybe to the left that will say, “It’s too late of a cause. Why did I try so much?” And so we do need to make sure that we don’t give up on this. It’s not worth ...

Feltman: Yep.

Sorensen: Giving up, and we can’t do it.

Feltman: Yeah, absolutely. And what are you feeling optimistic about right now?

Sorensen: I’m really excited because I’ve been working kind of day in, day out right now—after the tragedy that we saw on the Guadalupe River in Texas, when I started seeing politicians just pointing fingers at each other and I’m like, “That’s not gonna solve a problem.” Or: Do we argue how fast FEMA is going to get there afterwards? Why aren’t we looking at what happened before?

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: In the same respect, when we have an air disaster in this country, we have the [National Transportation Safety Board]. The NTSB goes and looks through every piece of data before the disaster occurred, everything that led up to it, so that we can change the policy, that we can change design.

I looked back: 1985, there was a horrific plane crash in North Texas—it was Delta 191. That hit wind shear, it hit a microburst from a storm, and it crashed and killed a lot of people. I was nine years old. It was the first thing that I really thought about when I was like, “Oh, meteorology played a role here.”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: But we don’t have this type of air disaster happening because we implemented Doppler radar at the biggest airports in the country now, so we can identify it so that airplanes don’t go into it. But that finding needs to happen every time there’s a weather disaster. And so I’m proposing an NWSB of sorts. Why can’t we go back and look, before the tragedy occurred, every piece that went wrong? ’Cause I think you’re probably gonna realize that it isn’t necessarily [going to be] in our lack of understanding of science. It’s gonna be in social science. It’s going to be ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Sorensen: “How do people perceive risk? Do people understand what is at stake? Do people understand that every time your phone goes off, it isn’t gonna kill you, but you need to pay attention for that one time where there is something that could?” And then develop the policy that’s gonna save people in the future. And I’m like, that’s a pretty good legacy to have, if we could do that in a bipartisan way.

Feltman: Yeah, absolutely. Is there anything we haven’t touched on that you think is important for us to talk about before I let you go?

Sorensen: A lot of people, they said, “There’s no way that a meteorologist could be elected to Congress.” And one of the things that I wanna be able to say is—it was really hard to blaze a trail through the jungle, right? I feel like I was trying to chop down all of these branches [laughs] to, to fight to find this path. And I wanna be able to look back on this path and see the next person coming up. I wanna be able to see other people say, “I wanna take part in this; I feel like I can make a difference,” and that, actually, science is one of those things that can bring us together when politics wants to break us apart.

And so my hope is, even though I’m just one meteorologist in Congress, that it will inspire other people and other people in science to say, “You know what? We do need to communicate these other things, too.” Or maybe if there’s a meteorologist somewhere out there that has worked in television for 25 years, earning the trust, that they’re gonna start to think, “Wait a minute, I might be that person.”

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: Or if it’s somebody listening to this podcast that says, “Oh my gosh, I really trust this person. They have really helped me. Maybe I need to reach out to them and say, ‘Did you know there’s a meteorologist in Congress? I want you ...’”

Feltman: Mm.

Sorensen: “‘To do this because you’ve helped me.’” That’s what public service has to be about.

Feltman: Well, thank you so much for coming on to chat with us today. I really appreciate it.

Sorensen: Oh, it was great, and I hope to be on again in the future, if you’ll have me.

Feltman: Absolutely.

They kept the one-foot minimum elevation requirement in flood zones but expanded the criteria that triggers it.","Early last spring, while still cleaning up the wreckage of devastating winter storms, southern Maine towns began drafting new rules governing how they’d rebuild or develop on stretches of land that were widely inundated months before.

The process coincided with the adoption of new federal flood maps and is required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

After years of back-and-forth between FEMA and local officials, the agency finalized its first flood map updates for Cumberland and York counties in decades.

The maps’ finalization last summer meant local officials had to update their floodplain ordinances to FEMA standards or risk their residents losing out on federal flood insurance — often a requirement for homeowners with government-backed mortgages who live in FEMA flood zones.

While municipalities could simply adopt boilerplate language that the Maine Floodplain Management Program provides towns based on their local flood threat (i.e. coastal or riverine), towns also had the opportunity to fine-tune or strengthen their floodplain rules further.

One way to do that is by requiring heightened standards if new developments or significant renovations occur inside regulated flood zones.

Municipalities, for example, could require that the lowest floor of a new development be built higher than the one foot above flood level that FEMA recommends, giving future homes more protection from sea level rise, which FEMA flood maps don’t account for.

That’s the path that Scarborough’s town council took last year. Their updated floodplain ordinances require anyone building a new development or making repairs worth more than 50 percent of a building’s value to raise the lowest floor two feet above flood level.

Brian Longstaff, Scarborough’s zoning administrator, said that he was a little hesitant about the proposal at first when considering the challenges it could pose to homeowners who were already in compliance with the FEMA minimum.

“It was a little bit of a big bite, I thought, but in the end, it makes sense,” Longstaff told The Maine Monitor, adding that the town is conducting a vulnerability assessment and its projections for future sea level rise show local flood risks growing down the line.

“I’m looking at the vulnerability assessment, the picture of risk maps… and there are some areas of Scarborough [where] the projections are pretty scary,” Longstaff said.

Down the coast in Wells, town officials took a different approach. They kept the one-foot minimum elevation requirement in flood zones but expanded the criteria that triggers it.

Whereas Scarborough requires repairs or remodels that are worth more than 50 percent of a building’s value and completed within one year to be elevated to its two-foot minimum, Wells tracks the cumulative value of such projects — adding up project costs over a multi-year period to determine when an elevation change is required.

That’s an effective way to close a common loophole used to get around similar ordinances according to Sue Baker, coordinator of the Maine Floodplain Management Program. (The Wells code enforcement director and town planner could not be reached for comment by publication.)

“There are some people that will just piecemeal their projects so that they stagger them out over a number of years, so that they don’t ever trigger the substantial improvement rule,” Baker said. “What I think is bad about that is now you’re putting thousands and thousands of dollars into a building, but you haven’t changed the risk.”

Scarborough considered similar language during the town’s ordinance development, but ultimately town officials didn’t adopt it, according to Longstaff. As a certified floodplain manager, he said he carefully evaluates projects in flood zones and can typically reach an understanding with the applicant about flood risks and how to mitigate them, though calculating cumulative improvements is “’a great idea to do over a reasonable period.”

The deadly floods that devastated Central Texas last month provide a stark example of what happens when flood zone development regulations are absent or unenforced. Camp Mystic, the summer camp where 27 campers and counselors died, was built in a high-risk flood zone.

In rural Texas, there are few regulatory powers afforded to county governments over flood zones and many communities exist outside of the jurisdiction of municipal ordinances, according to the Texas Tribune. In Maine, meanwhile, unorganized communities are overseen by the state Land Use Planning Commission, and county hazard mitigation initiatives are widespread.

Outside of southern Maine, Baker said the state is developing updated flood maps for multiple watersheds and pursuing new initiatives through the recently formed State Resilience Office and Office of Community Affairs.

But with the vulnerabilities exposed in last year’s storms and climate change’s intensification of sea level rise and heavy precipitation events, it only makes sense to elevate and move back from flood-ravaged areas whenever possible, according to Baker.

“I heard a good quote once upon a time,” Baker said. “‘There’s going to be retreat. The question is whether… it’s going to be managed or unmanaged.’”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Wells-flooding-20240113-pph.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 12:13:22.604113

KOKOMO — StarPlus Energy LLC, the joint venture between Stellantis and Samsung SDI, will lay off 59 salaried employees at its electric vehicle battery manufacturing facility in Kokomo, the automaker announced.

The decision follows what the company described as ongoing shifts in the U.S. electric vehicle market. The plant, a $2.5 billion investment announced in 2022, officially opened in December and was projected to have all three of its production lines operational by the end of 2025.

StarPlus Energy’s facility was expected to eventually employ 1,400 workers. Current staffing levels stand at approximately 730, according to the company. The latest round of layoffs represents about 18% of the facility’s salaried workforce.

The company said affected employees will receive severance packages that include continued benefits coverage.

The announcement comes about two months after several hundred hourly workers at the plant were placed on temporary layoff. Since then, more than a third of those workers have returned to the facility.

Plans for a second EV battery plant were announced in October 2023. The $3.2 billion project, also expected to create 1,400 jobs, was initially slated to begin production in 2027. However, the timeline remains uncertain as the company evaluates market conditions before proceeding with construction.

Amid political turbulence and an uncertain policy future, the clean and renewable energy sector continues to grow, spurred on by public demand for low-cost and reliable technologies to power their homes and vehicles. That would be good news — except that businesses across the industry face ongoing challenges finding enough qualified workers.

Despite the industry’s growth, businesses often struggle to find trained professionals across roles ranging from installers and electricians to positions in engineering, project management and operations. While the career opportunities are plentiful, many potential candidates remain unaware of the high-quality jobs and routes to advancement in the clean energy industries.

In the solar industry, for example, an overwhelming majority of employers say they face shortages of qualified workers to meet the demand for new installations. “It really does keep me up sometimes,” said one participant in the National Solar Jobs Census survey. “How are we going to build all these projects? Because there’s just not enough people.” In the energy efficiency sector, which employs 2.3 million people, most employers also report difficulty meeting their hiring needs.

These challenges have taken on new urgency as we seek to ramp up deployment of clean energy solutions at an unprecedented scale. To find a path forward, we’ve engaged in discussions with hundreds of employers and educators through forums like the National Clean Energy Workforce Alliance. As a result of these convenings, here are a few key strategies we’ve identified to help employers fill job openings with qualified talent.

Form strategic partnerships with educators

Businesses can form partnerships with community colleges, other training providers and community-based organizations in the regions where they seek to hire. Developing long-term alliances with educators will help meet recruitment needs and align training programs and curricula with the demands of the marketplace.

Such work can be labor-intensive, but fortunately employers don’t have to do this alone. At the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, we launched the Green Workforce Connect platform to help align the needs of job seekers, educators and employers. Job candidates can use the platform to learn about careers in the industry and connect with employers and training providers to match their skills and interests.

Create Registered Apprenticeship programs

An apprenticeship combines on-the-job experience with technical instruction, allowing apprentices to earn a salary and gain valuable skills as they work toward a nationally recognized credential. For clean energy companies, Registered Apprenticeships are a proven way to improve employee retention and develop a skilled workforce. They can be used to train employees for a wide variety of positions, ranging from construction to project management, IT, human resources and sales. For example, the solar company ReVision Energy leads an apprenticeship program focused on training managers.

Reconsider credential requirements

Many clean energy jobs (including more than half of the jobs in the solar industry) do not require a bachelor’s degree. Too often, however, hiring managers rely on proxies like four-year degrees, instead of recognizing the skills that so many workers in the energy industry already bring to the table. Consider how many roles like project manager or site supervisor require a college degree — despite the fact that so many workers with the skills and experience to do those jobs are stuck just one rung below because they don’t have the right credential.

There are 70 million U.S. workers — half of the country’s workforce — who are Skilled Through Alternative Routes rather than through a bachelor’s degree, such as through community college, military service or on-the-job training. Many of these STARs already have the skills to succeed in energy jobs, and in many cases, they are already working in the industry.

The success of STARs in energy-related fields is already evident across the sector. “Advancing from an HVAC Controls Technician to a Regional Service Leader has been a journey fueled by skills and performance rather than formal credentials,” says Cale Simmons, technician productivity leader at Trane Technologies. “My electronics background from the Navy, combined with hands-on learning and great mentors, allowed me to excel quickly. In the commercial HVAC industry, a strong desire to learn can be as valuable as a formal degree. Companies benefit immensely when they focus on what people can do rather than where they went to school.” Simmons represents millions of veterans and other STARs who bring critical technical skills to energy infrastructure roles.

Moving the work forward

Companies can tap into this talent potential by considering new approaches for how they look for workers, how they assess their skills and what barriers they can remove to create more accessible pathways into the industry. Workforce organizations and community groups can help advance a skills-first agenda that doesn’t just recognize STARs’ potential, but actually makes concrete changes to redesign talent practices and recruitment around skills instead of degrees.

Workers develop transferable skills not just through formal education but through years of hands-on experience. Skills like problem-solving, technical know-how, equipment operation and systems maintenance are part of the job for early-career workers in the energy industry. To meet their talent needs and address workforce shortages more effectively, businesses have both an opportunity and a responsibility to recognize and take advantage of these capabilities, expanding their view of where qualified talent comes from.

Sunrun installed 392 MWh of batteries in Q2 2025, up 48% from Q2 2024.
Company executives said Sunrun’s focus on energy storage aligns with utilities’ and grid operators’ growing interest in virtual power plants.","Dive Brief:

Seventy percent of the nearly 29,000 new Sunrun customers last quarter added paired batteries with rooftop solar systems, the largest U.S. home energy systems installer said Wednesday. That marked a 50% jump in the battery attachment rate from a year earlier.

The surge in battery attachments highlights Sunrun’s shift away from solar-only installations and toward energy storage systems that can support virtual power plants, company executives told investors and stock analysts. Sunrun has installed about 3.2 GWh of distributed storage capacity to date, they said, putting it on track to reach 10 GWh by 2029.

The expiration of the federal investment tax credit for third-party-owned residential solar equipment could deprive Sunrun of about $6,200 in revenue per system after 2027, it said in its Q2 2025 earnings presentation. To offset the loss, Sunrun said it would source lower-cost solar equipment, reduce customer acquisition costs, boost grid services revenue and raise power prices amid expected utility rate increases.

Dive Insight:

Sunrun has installed 195,000 solar-and-storage systems at its customers’ homes, it said Wednesday. The attachment rate has steadily increased since 2023, jumping from 18% to 54% from Q2 2023 to Q2 2024 and rising to 62% by Q4 2024.

The exponential jump from 2023 to 2024 followed California’s enactment of a new net billing tariff that incentivized storage attachments for new residential solar customers. California remains the largest state market for residential solar, and policy decisions there have an outsized impact on distributed energy providers like Sunrun.

Despite the slower pace of attachment growth this year, Sunrun is growing storage installations at a faster pace than solar-only installations. Sunrun installed 392 MWh of batteries in Q2 2025, up 48% from Q2 2024. It added 227 MW of solar capacity during the period, up 18% from a year earlier.

Company executives said Sunrun’s focus on energy storage aligns with utilities’ and grid operators’ growing interest in virtual power plants. VPPs network tens of thousands of customer-sited devices, such as home batteries, to dispatch tens or hundreds of megawatts of electricity during peak demand periods. Experts say VPPs are cheaper and faster to deploy than utility-scale power plants, which can take several years to permit and build.

“We’re focusing heavily [on] deploying battery devices and reaching penetration and concentration in areas that … have attractive home-to-grid virtual power plant type programs set up,” said Paul Dickson, Sunrun president and chief revenue officer.

Sunrun and Tesla batteries delivered 535 MW to the California grid in a July 29 test event involving customers of Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. The event showed that VPPs can meaningfully reduce net peak load and mitigate the need for investment in new generation, The Brattle Group said in a post-event report.

Roughly 35% of Sunrun’s batteries are enrolled in VPP programs, “and we anticipate that [share] growing nicely,” Dickson said.

The Trump administration’s hostility to wind and solar energy may spur Democratic-controlled states to sustain or expand support for customer-sited solar and batteries, Dickson said.

“We’ve seen … some enhancements there and some further commitments [on customer rebate programs],” he said. “And then I would say early conversations are kind of budding in several new markets that create interesting and exciting opportunities for us.”

The NC Clean Energy Technology Center and the Smart Electric Power Alliance flagged significant VPP-related developments in Colorado, Maryland and North Carolina in a report released earlier this year. Overall, 38 states and the District of Columbia took policy or regulatory steps to support distributed energy resources in 2024, the report authors said.

By the middle of August, Sunrun will have a multi-year backlog of projects that it expects to qualify for the solar investment tax credit beyond its end-of-2027 expiration date, the company said in its earnings presentation. The company expects to further expand this backlog — possibly as far out as 2030 — once the U.S. Department of Treasury releases revised “safe harbor” guidance for clean energy developers, executives said on the call.

Despite rumors that the revised guidance could retroactively apply to projects that began construction earlier this year, that outcome is “very, very low likelihood,” Sunrun CEO Mary Powell said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-s3-6l70tq-kwybgoviC3o3tRHu-l6phxFJJ4UBedg4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy05MDkzOTA0ODguanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-08 12:14:08.366992

The repeal of the standards is “a welcome recognition by the EPA of its past missteps and errors,” PSC Chairwoman Charlotte Lane wrote in a 15-page letter sent to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

The 2009 standard, called the endangerment finding, has been a declaration that six key greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, endanger public health and welfare because of their contribution to climate change.

The finding is a basis for regulating such gases under the Clean Air Act. Legal experts say the finding is based on scientific evidence showing that such gases trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to a range of negative effects on human health and the environment.

Zeldin, the EPA administrator, announced the policy change last week during a visit to an Indianapolis automotive facility where he emphasized the economic effects of emissions standards.

West Virginia’s Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, argued in its letter that the EPA’s existing rules could harm the reliability of the electric grid and increase costs for consumers.

West Virginia is a major producer of coal and natural gas.

“The closing of the fossil fuel, and particularly coal-fired, generation has already and will continue to severely reduce the reliability and resilience of the electric grid,” Lane wrote in the PSC’s letter.

The PSC chairwoman wrote that the EPA’s endangerment finding “is unnecessary and ill-advised overkill that will cripple the electric grid in the U.S. without accomplishing any meaningful reduction in the output of carbon dioxide as compared to worldwide emissions or the absolute level of CO2 in the atmosphere.”",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/John_Amos-power-plant-e1665216399357.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:07:08.079874

Researchers have now developed a new classical physics model that captures one of the most complex aspects of energy storage research – the dynamic nonequilibrium processes that throw chemical, mechanical and physical aspects of energy storage materials out of balance when they are charging or discharging energy.

The new Chen-Huang Nonequilibrium Phasex Transformation (NExT) Model was developed by Hongjiang Chen, a former Ph.D. student at NC State, in conjunction with his advisor, Hsiao-Ying Shadow Huang, who is an associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the university. A paper on the work, “Energy Change Pathways in Electrodes during Nonequilibrium Processes,” is published in The Journal of Physical Chemistry C.

But what are “nonequilibrium processes”? Why are they important? And why would you want to translate those processes into mathematical formulae? We talked with Huang to learn more.

The Abstract: This is a highly technical paper, so I want to break it down piece by piece. To start with, what are “nonequilibrium processes”? Why are they important?

Hsiao-Ying Shadow Huang: When a lithium-ion battery is disconnected and sits for hours, it approaches equilibrium. In an equilibrium state, lithium-ion batteries exhibit no current flow, have uniformly distributed lithium-ion concentrations in the electrolyte and electrode materials, maintain stable temperatures without gradients (meaning the temperature is the same throughout the material), and present stable electrode potentials with no net chemical reactions occurring.

Even during slow charging and discharging, a lithium-ion battery is operating under nonequilibrium conditions.

Charging and discharging of lithium-ion batteries is fundamentally a nonequilibrium process, involving multiple transport phenomena that deviate significantly from thermodynamic equilibrium. That is, it pushes it far from its natural resting state, causing several physical and chemical changes inside the battery that can impact its performance and lifespan. Even during slow charging and discharging, the battery is operating under nonequilibrium conditions. But during rapid charging and discharging, the deviation from equilibrium is more pronounced.

Rapidly charging or drawing energy from a lithium-ion battery requires lithium ions to move rapidly through the electrolyte of the battery and into the electrodes. This creates an uneven distribution of ions with some areas becoming crowded with ions while others are depleted. This mass transport imbalance drives intense movement that deviates significantly from the lithium-ion battery’s usual stable state, as the system cannot maintain uniform concentrations throughout.

But there are also other factors that come into play under nonequilibrium conditions.

Fast operation generates substantial heat, which spreads unevenly throughout the battery, creating hot and cool spots. These temperature differences cause chemical reactions to proceed at different rates in different locations, making the entire system increasingly unstable and further removed from its equilibrium state.

Under rapid charge and discharge conditions, the battery operates at voltages far removed from its ideal open-circuit voltage, meaning it cannot function in a balanced or energy-efficient manner. This electrochemical imbalance requires large overpotentials to drive the high current flows, again pushing the system further from equilibrium.

And the rapid movement of lithium-ions in and out of battery materials causes physical expansion and contraction that occurs faster than the materials can mechanically adjust, creating significant internal stress. This mechanical strain can lead to the formation of tiny cracks in the electrode materials and cause accelerated wear in certain parts of the battery. In materials like LiFePO4, these conditions force internal structural changes to occur under kinetically rushed conditions rather than through the naturally stable thermodynamic processes that would occur during slow operation.

In short, nonequilibrium processes can pose significant challenges when it comes to both having the battery operate efficiently and protecting the structural integrity of the battery.

TA: Why is it important to understand these nonequilibrium processes?

Huang: Understanding these nonequilibrium aspects is crucial for the following reasons:

You must understand nonequilibrium processes to develop protocols for fast charging and discharging of energy from lithium-ion batteries that balance speed with safety and help to extend the longevity of lithium-ion batteries. (The challenge in rapid charging and discharging is managing nonequilibrium processes to achieve fast energy storage while minimizing degradation mechanisms that also arise from operating far from equilibrium.)

Nonequilibrium processes are critical for developing thermal management systems to handle the heat generated by these processes.

Understanding these processes is critical when designing materials that can be used in electrodes to better handle nonequilibrium transport.

TA: There are not established classical physical models – mathematical formulas – that adequately capture those nonequilibrium processes? Is that correct?

Huang: There are classical physical models for lithium-ion batteries. However, their predictive accuracy is often limited. This limitation arises primarily from: (i) the use of model inputs with constrained accuracy, often based on linear assumptions; (ii) the omission of complex system phenomena, such as mass transport; and (iii) an incomplete understanding of the underlying processes and characteristics of lithium-ion battery systems – for example, widely used commercial simulation software is typically restricted to modeling equilibrium processes.

TA: Why are these models important?

Huang: Accurate classical physical models provide the essential mathematical foundations and conceptual frameworks that support computational modeling of materials and enable machine learning (ML) programs to address questions related to materials science and engineering. The differential equations, optimization theory and statistical methods developed in physics directly translate into core ML algorithms – from gradient descent techniques to neural network operations. Most importantly, physics demonstrates how complex phenomena can be understood through mathematical abstraction and iterative refinement, the same approach used in training ML models. Without the mathematical rigor, analytical thinking, and modeling paradigms from classical physics, machine learning would lack the computational tools and intellectual framework necessary to extract meaningful patterns from data and make reliable predictions.

TA: So, what did you do here?

Huang: In this study, we propose a new mechanism to explain how lithium-ion battery materials like LiFePO4 (LFP) and lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (NMC) undergo phase transitions under nonequilibrium conditions – such as fast charging or discharging. We introduce the concept of path factors, which influence how energy changes within the material during lithium-ion insertion and removal. These factors interact with key properties like lithium content, mechanical strain, structural defects (dislocations) and material order. Our simulations show that dislocation density, which increases with faster electrochemical reactions, plays a critical role in driving structural changes. By modeling these effects across multiple material states – like lithium-rich vs. lithium-poor and ordered vs. disordered – we capture how the internal structure shifts dynamically.

We validated our model by comparing simulation results to experimental data for both LFP and NMC materials across various charge/discharge rates. The agreement supports our pathway-altering mechanism as a powerful tool to understand and potentially improve battery performance under nonequilibrium conditions.

In other words, our model can be incorporated into computational tools to improve our ability to engineer better batteries.

TA: Can the NExT Model you developed be used to address a variety of nonequilibrium processes? And, if so, why did you focus specifically on electrodes and lithium-ion batteries in the journal article?

Huang: Extensive experimental data are essential for developing accurate classical physical models, as they provide the empirical basis needed to transform theoretical ideas into reliable scientific understanding. For lithium-ion battery materials such as LFP and NMC, a wealth of experimental results from various research groups has become available. This abundance of data was a key motivation for developing the NExT Model, which is specifically designed to capture the behavior of these widely studied systems. By drawing on experimental findings across different conditions, length scales and phenomena, we ensure that our mathematical formulations reflect real physical processes rather than remaining abstract theoretical constructs. The iterative interplay between modeling and experimentation enables us to identify model limitations, adjust key parameters, and uncover new physical insights – ultimately leading to more precise and comprehensive representations of complex systems.

TA: What are other applications that can make use of the NExT Model?

Huang: Although our current published work focuses on lithium-ion battery materials such as LFP and NMC, the underlying pathway-altering mechanism and the concept of path factors are broadly applicable and can be extended to other energy storage systems, including multivalent battery materials (e.g., those based on magnesium, calcium or zinc). These systems often exhibit more complex ion-host interactions and phase behaviors, where nonequilibrium effects play an even more critical role. By capturing the coupled evolution of dislocation dynamics, mechanical strain, and multi-state phase transitions, our framework (i.e., the NExT Model) contributes to the advancement of computational materials science, offering a predictive and mechanistic tool for investigating complex, rate-dependent processes. In the broader context, this approach supports the rational design of next-generation energy storage materials and devices, accelerating materials discovery and optimization through physics-informed modeling grounded in experimental validation.",https://news.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Shadow-Huang-header-NASA.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:08:19.684645

""With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,"" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the announcement.
Focus on consumer demand Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.
The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts.
""[Auto makers] will not get a reliable new set of rules anytime soon,"" said Victor.","A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal to revoke a landmark greenhouse gas finding could alter the direction of the auto industry, which until now has had to abide by strict emissions guidelines.

The EPA on July 29 announced it is planning to revoke an ""endangerment finding"" from 2009 that has served as the legal and scientific basis for the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple industries, including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas producers and aircraft. The proposal, which still needs to go through a public comment period, focuses on regulations affecting the auto industry. If passed, it would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.

""With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,"" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the announcement.

Strict standards for emissions and fuel efficiency introduced during the Obama administration and expanded during the Biden administration, which also provided generous EV funding, has led many auto makers to add electric vehicles to their fleets in recent years. Others, like Volvo, have taken things a step further and committed to a fully electric future. But the landscape is shifting under President Trump, who has pushed forward a deregulatory agenda.

Experts say that if this proposal passes, it will ease pressure on auto makers to produce electric cars, enabling them to adapt their mix of EV and gas-powered vehicle offerings to meet consumer demand.

""It gives auto makers a little bit better ability to build, to produce and put vehicles on market that are more closely aligned with the pace of electric adoption right now,"" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global.

John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most of the major car manufacturers in the U.S., said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the trade association is reviewing the announcement.

""At the same time,"" he added, ""there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.""

A spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding ""does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.""

Focus on consumer demand

Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.

""Their focus is going to be on making vehicles more affordable and dealing with the fact that consumers, not the government, are standing in the way of the mass adoption for EVs,"" Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.

The rate of electric vehicle adoption has been steady over the last several years, although the majority of Americans still fuel their cars at the pump. Demand for the vehicles has waned over the last year, according to data on light vehicle registration from S&P Global Mobility. From January to May, the electric vehicle market share was 7.3%, compared with 8% for the entire year of 2024, data from the auto intelligence provider shows.

But while consumer demand may have stalled slightly over the past year, auto makers will still want to offer low-emissions products in order to stay competitive both at home and abroad, Ivan Drury, director of insights at online car marketplace Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch.

""Every auto maker is a global competitor, and even though they might not be selling as well here, they could sell elsewhere better,"" he said.

Impact would take time

Experts say the proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change any near-term plans of auto makers, given the time and money they have already invested in their product lines.

""If had already planned to build X number of this kind of vehicle, you can change that, but not necessarily tomorrow,"" said Brinley. ""So that's gonna have to be planned out.""

Product development cycles at car manufacturers span five to 10 years, according to a report from Eurasia Group, a global research firm.

The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts. ""For now, auto makers would enjoy the flexibility and lower costs from less stringent emissions limits, particularly in their nonelectric fleet planning,"" the report from Eurasia says.

There are concerns among some companies that the EPA's proposal, if passed, would inject a degree of chaos into industry, David Victor, a professor at University of California San Diego, told CBS MoneyWatch. Also, the rule-making process will likely be challenged in the courts, he said.

A boost to Indiana’s public charging infrastructure is on the horizon

Under the new funding, the 18 DC fast charging locations will be situated along Indiana’s ‘Alternative Fuel Corridors’, being strategically located close to or on major highway routes that will help enable long-distance EV travel across the state and beyond. These stations will have 24/7 access, in areas such as shopping centres, restaurants, and travel hubs. Firms awarded funding to create these new fast-charging stations include Tesla, who will create one new Supercharging location in the city of Fort Wayne, but most significantly gas station operator Pilot Flying J, who will open eight new charging locations under the funding.

Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said he has mixed feelings about the fate of federal energy assistance programs, especially those that encourage rooftop solar.
Case admits to being perhaps the state’s most notorious critic of rooftop solar — he’s sponsored several bills to overhaul the state’s rooftop solar net-metering law.","Wyoming-based All Solar has seen steadily increasing demand in recent years among homeowners and small businesses seeking some level of “energy independence,” including some clients that might surprise.

“It runs the gamut,” All Solar Head of Operations Riley Pieper told WyoFile, “from Rocky Mountain Power [customers] to people in the oilfield that you wouldn’t really expect. They love their solar equipment.”

The company currently has more than 100 installs scheduled and has been preparing to expand operations in the state and potentially open new branches in Montana and Nebraska. But those ambitions might be on hold for a while, Pieper said.

The long-running 30% tax credit for residential rooftop solar will close at the end of this year due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill. A lot of All Solar’s past and prospective clients rely on the tax credit, according to Pieper. When it goes away, “it won’t make as much [economic] sense for a lot of people,” she said. “It is definitely not ideal.”

Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress have frozen or cut consumer-level renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, as well as halted permitting for commercial-scale wind and solar projects and gutted research budgets and grant programs for the industries.

Speculation abounds about the actual impacts for Wyoming homeowners and small businesses, as well as commercial wind and solar developers. Not only will the new policy moves take time to play out in the market, but many are likely to be tied up in court challenges, according to sources who spoke with WyoFile.

Rising costs

The stakes are high for a lot of Wyoming households. Many have already seen electric bills increase by double digits, and one analysis predicts the nation’s current policy direction could spike bills here by another 29% over the next decade.

“For low-income residents in particular, they’re just going to be subject to increasing [electric] rates, which is just going to continue to exacerbate as we have data centers coming online and wildfire risk continuing to drive [utilities’] insurance costs to go up,” Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Energy and Climate Associate Jonathan Williams told WyoFile, referring to a mounting insurance cost and litigation dilemma for both electric utilities and their customers.

The council has been working for years on another federal program it believes is a particularly good fit in Wyoming, according to Williams.

Solar For All, created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was aimed at helping low- and medium-income households, along with nonprofits and Native American tribes, to pay for solar panel installations. Some $30 million was set aside for qualifying Wyoming applicants, and $5 million of that was set aside for the Wind River Indian Reservation.

But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to cancel some $7 billion in grants already awarded under the program, throwing into doubt Wyoming’s share.

Big Wind Carpenter, a member of the Northern Arapaho tribe, serves as the Outdoor Council’s tribal engagement coordinator. Some workforce training was already underway, they said, and the tribes had identified several housing project facilities as ideal candidates for rooftop solar.

“Putting rooftop solar on those houses would have saved [money for] a lot of people who are already lower-income families,” Big Wind said.

The council estimated that perhaps more than 30% of all Wyoming households might have qualified for assistance under the Solar for All program.

The potential lost opportunity in Wyoming is compounded by the administration putting into limbo more than $50 million for the Home Energy Savings Program to help low-income households cope with rising electric utility rates “and access more reliable energy by providing rebates for home energy efficiency projects,” according to a 2024 state presentation.

“Just across the board, on numerous programs similar to [Solar for All], which is an intent to reduce electricity bills, folks have seen uncertainty and new headwinds that have popped up,” Williams added.

Part of the drive behind the Solar for All program, according to Lander-based Creative Energies co-founder Scott Kane, was in response to the long-running tax credit for rooftop solar and criticism that it too narrowly catered to households that could afford the investment.

“The solar for all program was trying to push the energy transition in our country,” Kane said. “But it was also really motivated by environmental justice. It was really trying to make sure that the benefits of clean energy were accruing to all of society, not just the healthier economic tiers. That’s the thing that hurts so much about the loss of the Solar for All program: They’re pushing solar back to a time when only higher-income families could afford solar.”

Support, criticism for wind and solar

Despite Wyoming’s deep roots in fossil fuels and skepticism of renewables — particularly wind turbines proliferating across the landscape — more residents are warming to renewable energy, especially for powering their homes. Rising electricity rates likely play a big role.

The increasing costs are changing attitudes, Williams suggested, noting that about 70% of Wyoming residents support rooftop solar, citing the University of Wyoming’s 2022 report, Social License for Wyoming’s Energy Future.

Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said he has mixed feelings about the fate of federal energy assistance programs, especially those that encourage rooftop solar. Case admits to being perhaps the state’s most notorious critic of rooftop solar — he’s sponsored several bills to overhaul the state’s rooftop solar net-metering law.

“I think pricing is not very good under a net-metering situation, because the person that’s making the installation avoids fixed costs and the utility makes up those costs from other customers,” he said.

A large portion of Case’s district includes the Wind River Reservation. He said he supports energy assistance efforts there, and for low-income communities and households across the state. But, “I do want to have that dialogue about fixing that — net-metering — and a lot of other things.”

Last year, Gov. Mark Gordon established the Grants Management Office to assist local governments, businesses and nonprofits in pursuing state and federal grant programs, including initiatives under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act. The office has already fielded 500 requests, according to an annual report.

For his part, Gordon “recognizes that the Trump administration may have different priorities than the previous administration,” Gordon’s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile via email. “Ultimately, this is a decision being made at the federal level and the Governor respects whatever the final decision is on the status of those programs.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/solar-panels-and-dripping-clouds-fossil-butte-nm-lincoln-county-dbleizeffer1754648810.jpg?h=58063fbc&itok=p_ao8cyJ,N,,2025-08-08 19:02:33.719329

(NYSE: F) vehicles are the F-Series pickup. Sales of the electric version, called the F-150 Lightning, were tiny in July. There were 2,381 of Ford’s total car, SUV, and pickup figure of 189,313 for the month.

The Ford F-Series has several versions powered by an eight-cylinder five-liter engine. It would be hard to find many vehicles that get worse gas mileage. The F-Series competitor Ram pickup ranked fifth based on unit sales in the first half of 2025. Another competitor, the Chevy Silverado, ranked second.

The U.S. car industry has turned its back on smaller fuel-efficient cars for several reasons. The first is that many are electric vehicles (EVs). Ford, GM, and Stellantis have had almost no success in EV sales, despite investing billions of dollars.

Small sedans are less profitable than pickups and SUVs. Ford phased out most of its sedans in 2018, leaving much of the market to the Japanese, and later the South Koreans. The company has shown no interest in getting back into that business.

One reason car companies have moved to less fuel-efficient vehicles is because they can. NPR reported on July 29: “For years the Environmental Protection Agency has pushed carmakers to reduce how much vehicles contribute to climate change. Today the EPA laid out plans to not just weaken those rules, but end them entirely.” Car companies can build less fuel-efficient cars because they no longer face penalties.

The rise in EV sales in the United States has leveled off. The $7,500 tax credit given with the sales of many of these will be gone in the fourth quarter.

Cars with poor fuel efficiency will rule the roads, perhaps for years.

Quick Facts

Project Location: Central New Brunswick

Minerals: Tungsten, molybdenum

Federal Funding: $8.2 million (Global Partnerships Initiative)

National Strategy Budget: $3.8 billion

Use Cases: Renewable energy systems, defense, aerospace, manufacturing, energy storage

The funding, provided through the Global Partnerships Initiative, will support a feasibility study update and engineering design for the project, developed by Northcliff Resources. This work will deliver the technical and economic foundation needed for a construction decision.

“This federal investment in the Northcliff Resources project will enable the production of these minerals and strengthen our economy and security while creating good jobs in New Brunswick,” said Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, in the August 2025 press release.

Why Critical Minerals Matter

Critical minerals are the building blocks of the modern economy — essential for producing solar panels, semiconductors, wind turbines, and advanced batteries for storage and transportation.

No energy transition is possible without them.

Supply chain resilience has become a strategic priority for advanced economies.

Global demand is projected to soar over the next two decades, with the International Energy Agency warning of potential supply deficits if production, processing, and recycling do not expand.

Tungsten and molybdenum are particularly strategic:

Tungsten: Used in aerospace, defense, and high-performance manufacturing; over 80% of global supply comes from China, creating supply chain vulnerability.

Molybdenum: Strengthens steel alloys, supports renewable energy systems, and is in high demand for infrastructure and industrial equipment; demand is forecast to grow at ~4% annually through 2030.

With vast reserves and strong mining and manufacturing expertise, Canada is positioned to become a secure and reliable supplier of these minerals to both domestic and global markets.

The Strategic Role of the Sisson Project

Located in central New Brunswick, the Sisson Project is expected to become:

One of North America’s largest sources of tungsten

A significant producer of molybdenum for renewable energy, clean technology, and industrial manufacturing

“This project will create good jobs, drive economic growth and help position Canada as a reliable supplier of critical minerals. Together, we are shifting our economy from reliance to resilience,” said Dominic LeBlanc, Minister responsible for Canada–U.S. Trade.

By securing domestic production, Canada can reduce dependence on high-risk foreign sources, strengthen supply chains for its allies, and ensure critical industries have reliable access to essential materials.

Canada’s Critical Minerals Strategy

Backed by $3.8 billion, the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy focuses on six priorities:

Driving exploration, research, and innovation

Accelerating project development

Building sustainable infrastructure

Advancing reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples

Growing a diverse workforce and prosperous communities

Strengthening global leadership and security

The strategy promotes a “nature-forward” approach that minimizes environmental impact, protects biodiversity, and incorporates Indigenous stewardship principles. It also supports a circular economy by expanding recycling technologies to recover valuable minerals from end-of-life products and mining waste.

A National and Global Play

The $8.2 million investment in the Sisson Project represents more than a regional development. It is a strategic step in a nationwide plan to secure the minerals that underpin the global energy transition and advanced manufacturing.

With tungsten and molybdenum production poised to strengthen Canada’s industrial capacity and geopolitical resilience, the project supports the federal goal to diversify supply chains, reduce reliance on imports from non-like-minded countries, and ensure sustainable, inclusive growth.

As global competition for critical minerals intensifies, projects like Sisson will be pivotal in helping Canada:

Meet its net-zero climate targets

Advance economic reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples

Gavin Newsom next week.

That’s because Wu went before the California Air Resources Board in June to make her own pitch for the list, which will help dictate the next phase of the state’s clean vehicles program.

“California should really use its limited dollars towards closing these equity gaps that the market is failing to fill,” says Wu, the senior program manager for transportation equity at The Greenlining Institute, an organization that promotes climate, racial and economic equity.

The state must focus more funds and resources on addressing barriers to adopting zero-emission vehicles in disadvantaged communities, like reliable charging stations and affordable cars, according to Wu.

The public meeting Wu took part in as well as the Aug. 11 recommendations deadline come as California grapples with how to handle its air pollution problem after Congress and President Donald Trump revoked the state’s long-standing ability to set vehicle emission standards stricter than those of the federal government.

With its toolbox now limited, California must navigate its goals of decreasing pollution and increasing the use of electric vehicles and other zero-emission cars with an unsupportive federal government watching its every move.

The Stormy Politics of Geoengineering

A California Problem – and a National One

Though California stands next to last in the air quality category of the U.S. News Best States rankings, pollution is a nationwide problem. And air quality is on the decline across much of the U.S.

Decades of research have shown that exposure to air pollution can come with a multitude of health problems, including an increased risk of respiratory infections, heart disease, stroke and lung cancer.

Nearly half of Americans are living in areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution, according to the latest “State of the Air” report from the American Lung Association. California claims seven of the top 10 most polluted counties.

Transportation plays a major role in air pollution, as the burning of fossil fuels in cars releases a number of pollutants into the atmosphere. Air pollution from transportation contributes to smog and poor air quality.

The high number of cars on California’s roads as well as the state’s surrounding mountain ranges that prevent pollutants from dispersing make it a hot spot for air pollution.

Wanting Action, Getting Pushback

Trump has spent much of his second term trying to offset well-established federal responsibilities to states when it comes to the Education Department or Federal Emergency Management Agency. But that’s not the case for California, at least when it’s about air pollution.

Congress gave California the authority to set its own vehicle standards under the 1967 Clean Air Act to address some of the country’s worst air quality. The state responded with an aggressive agenda that saw the Environmental Protection Agency approve over 100 waivers for its clean air and climate efforts.

But in June, Trump signed into law the repeal of three of the states most ambitious waivers:

A waiver that allowed California to implement a plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035.

A waiver that allowed California to require an increasing percentage of zero-emission trucks to be sold in the state.

A waiver that allowed California to set more stringent low-nitrogen oxide emission standards for heavy-duty highway and off-road vehicles.

“It is the Federal Government, not States, that should establish vehicle emission standards given the inherently interstate nature of air quality; a patchwork of State vehicle regulations on this subject is unworkable,” Trump said in a statement.

The steps are a major win for the oil and gas industry, which has long stood against California’s vehicle emission standards and applauded Trump’s decision as a win for the American consumer.

“The President and Congress just delivered a major win for the American people by overturning California’s gas car ban and the state’s attempt to tell consumers what they can and can’t drive,” American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers President Chet Thompson said in a joint statement at the time.

California – as well as other states that were using the Golden State’s standards – sued Trump, arguing Congress and the president illegally used the Congressional Review Act to revoke the waivers.

It's far from the only blow to California’s air pollution strategies and the electric vehicle market in the era of Trump. After Trump was elected for a second time but before his inauguration, California announced that it would abandon four pending waivers that the Biden administration had not yet approved that included a proposal to phase out diesel trucks. Additionally, Trump has since reversed many federal policies on electric cars, including tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases and leases.

Restrained by the Trump administration, California now has to look for other ways to address its air pollution that steer clear of the federal government.

That’s where the public comes in.

‘California Shouldn’t Wait’

In response to Trump’s actions, Newsom signed an executive order in June “kickstarting development of next-generation policy to spur innovation, updating state vehicle purchasing requirements and directing the state to craft new actions to accelerate affordable clean vehicle adoption.”

He ordered the California Air Resources Board and other state agencies to assess additional actions to spur zero-emission vehicle adoption in California and to deliver formal recommendations next week. The state hosted a series of public meetings – including the one Wu spoke at – to hear ideas from environmental and scientific communities, automotive and trucking industries, fleet operators, community groups and the public on how to move forward.

“Lots of folks are trying to figure out what those things should be, and I'm one of them,” says Dan Becker, the director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. “But no decisions have been made.”

“The governor and the legislature should understand that their people need to breathe clean air, and that auto pollution is the worst contributor to the polluted air in California,” Becker says. “So they've got to do something, and I'm optimistic that they will.”

He says the state can do several things that don’t require waivers, including incentivizing automakers to make zero-emission vehicles. For example, to sell a new car in California, it must be tested for certification before its sale. Becker says the state could prioritize quicker review for zero-emission vehicles.

“The auto companies are completely within their rights to make vehicles that emit less than the law requires,” Becker says. “Trump is basically saying, ‘Emit as much as you want.’ But there are reasons why auto companies might not want to pollute as much as they're legally allowed by Trump … and the biggest one is called China.”

Experts are concerned that if the U.S. electric vehicle market slows, it could cede influence to China, which boasts a robust market at a much more affordable price.

Mary Nichols, who was previously the chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, says the “worst case scenario” would be that Trump’s actions slow down the push toward electric vehicles. “The best case is that the market takes off as it deserves to, and companies decide to boost production and to continue or extend their investments of electric vehicles.”

Becker says the industry shouldn’t wait until Trump leaves office to act.

“California shouldn't wait now to begin preparing the way for that because you don't want to start in 2029 from ground zero,” he says. “You want to have already prepared everything and built your case and got ready to submit it to the next administration.”

“California is the most important car market in the country and, therefore, the most important car market in the world,” Becker says.

Over 2.3 million zero-emission vehicles have been sold in California, and currently about 1 in 5 new cars sold are zero-emission vehicles, according to the state.

“The reality is that California has an enormous amount of power,” Becker says. “It would be better if they continued to have the standards that Trump is trying to take away from them, but there are things that they can do even if Trump succeeds in the short term.”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/1f7e89e/2147483647/crop/4047x2699+0+0/resize/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fc4%2Fca%2F75c2d9ad4b86891f332d7453eb7b%2F250807bs-california.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 10:58:08.899394

The milestone highlights the company's accelerating focus on clean energy storage, even as global vehicle sales face headwinds.

Announced on July 29 by Tesla Asia in an X post featuring a photo of employees gathered around the unit with balloons spelling out ""Megapack 1000,"" the milestone unit will be exported to Europe — marking another step in Tesla's efforts to expand its global energy storage footprint.

The Shanghai site, which broke ground in May 2024 and began production in February 2025, is Tesla's first energy storage facility outside the United States.

The Megapack is Tesla's grid-scale battery system, designed to store and dispatch renewable power, such as excess solar or wind energy, when the grid needs it most.

The batteries are already in use in over 65 countries, per Teslarati, supporting everything from national power grids to commercial installations. This fast ramp-up in Shanghai signals growth in a key area of Tesla's business, especially as the company faces softer demand in its core EV market.

According to Reuters, Tesla's global deliveries dropped 13.5% in Q2 2025, continuing a downward trend from earlier in the year. At the same time, the Megapack's growth suggests that Tesla's energy division may play a larger role in its long-term strategy.

Megapacks are already playing key roles in projects everywhere from France to Australia to Alaska.

Solar energy also plays a powerful supporting role in Tesla's vision.

Pairing solar panels with an electric vehicle can dramatically lower fuel costs over time, since solar charging is often cheaper than relying on the grid or public stations. EnergySage helps homeowners compare quotes from vetted local panel installers and can save consumers up to $10,000 on installation.

With each Megapack shipped, Tesla isn't just building batteries — it is building the backbone of a cleaner, more resilient future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-rec6Z3Twc6kvVXORN.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:08:33.317305

""Post heat pump install, first bill,"" the post read.
The OP attached pictures of two electric bills — one from before the heat pump install and one from after.

These slashed energy bills can lead to significant long-term savings while adopting a cleaner method to heat and cool your home.","One homeowner shared evidence of their savings with their new heat pump on the r/heatpumps subreddit.

""Post heat pump install, first bill,"" the post read. The OP attached pictures of two electric bills — one from before the heat pump install and one from after. The first bill's charge totaled over $440, whereas the second bill was more than half that at $200.

In the comments, the OP clarified that they had upgraded from their 35-year-old central air conditioning system to a Mitsubishi Hyper Heat system to heat and cool their 1,500-square-foot home. The heat pump project consisted of three outdoor units and seven indoor units that would work together to move heat from one location to another.

Heat pumps are an energy-efficient and cost-effective method to heat and cool your home, as heat pump technology, which runs on electricity, works to transfer heat, rather than generate heat, typically by burning dirty energy sources like gas, as most central heating and cooling systems do.

Heating and cooling your home represent a significant portion of your energy bills. Traditional HVAC systems — especially outdated ones — are much less energy-efficient than heat pumps, using more energy to deliver the same level of comfort, which translates to more expensive energy bills.

These slashed energy bills can lead to significant long-term savings while adopting a cleaner method to heat and cool your home.

With tax incentives available through the Inflation Reduction Act, homeowners may receive a $2,000 tax credit, or a rebate for four times that amount for low-income households, for installing a qualified heat pump system.

However, these incentives are scheduled to expire by the end of the year, due to the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill, which eliminates many of the tax credits available through the IRA.

Homeowners looking to take advantage of these incentives should act quickly while they are still available.

While it may seem difficult to find trusted advice on your specific heating and cooling system, there are plenty of available tools, like Mitsubishi's wide network, that can help you find an efficient system and trusted installers to bring both your energy and investment costs down.

Why It Matters: Rebuilding the West Belle Headland isn’t just about sediment.","Louisiana’s fragile coastline is in a fight against time, and tide.

Now, thanks to a new agreement between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA), critical reinforcements are on the way.

In July 2025, BOEM signed a Noncompetitive Negotiated Agreement (NNA) with CPRA authorizing the use of sand from two federal borrow sites on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The mission: restore the severely eroded West Belle Headland: a vital natural barrier that has lost over half its original length.

Located along the southeastern edge of Timbalier Bay in Lafourche Parish, West Belle Headland isn’t just sand and grass. It is a sentinel. West Belle shields nearby wetlands and communities from wave action, saltwater intrusion, and hurricane storm surge. But the area is also vanishing fast, retreating at rates topping 100 feet per year in some areas.

The damage escalated after Hurricane Zeta tore through the Gulf in 2020. Just 25 miles from the headland, the Category 3 storm undid years of restoration work, wiping out nearly 75% of the new sediment placed on the beach.

Today, restoration efforts are back in motion. CPRA has received more than $722,000 from FEMA for project design and environmental review, with further funding under evaluation. The goal is to restore beach, dune, and marsh habitat, which all serve as natural defenses that can absorb storm energy and hold the line against further erosion.

With BOEM’s help, 4 million cubic yards of sand from Ship Shoal will be used to rebuild the headland’s form and function. These offshore deposits, once part of ancient coastal systems, now serve as a lifeline for modern-day Louisiana.

This partnership is part of a broader strategy by BOEM to manage federal marine minerals for projects that enhance community resilience, protect infrastructure, and preserve natural ecosystems.

Why It Matters:

Rebuilding the West Belle Headland isn’t just about sediment. It’s about saving habitat, preventing loss, and creating a stronger coastal future for Louisiana.

The acquisition includes 16 GWh of existing battery manufacturing capacity, more than 15 GWh of capacity under construction, as well as infrastructure and plans to scale to more than 100 GWh. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Lyten noted that the assets were previously valued at approximately $5 billion.

Stockholm-based Northvolt announced in March that it had filed for bankruptcy, marking a major downfall for one of the most ambitious endeavors to establish a European EV battery giant. Founded in 2016, Northvolt was established with a goal to develop the “world’s greenest battery,” targeting a minimal carbon footprint, sustainable sourcing of raw materials and recycling. The company raised over $14 billion in capital, but faced a series of challenges, including a significant downshift in EV demand in Europe, as well as rising capital costs, geopolitical instability and supply chain disruptions.

Lyten has previously announced agreements to acquire Northvolt’s Cuberg battery manufacturing facility in California in November 2024, and Northvolt Dwa, Europe’s largest Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) manufacturing facility, located in Gdansk, Poland, in July 2024, and last month, the company announced the acquisition of the Northvolt Dwa Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) product portfolio in Stockholm.

Lyten said that it plans to immediately restart operations at Northvolt Ett and Labs upon close of the transaction, and that it is working with the German government to continue the program to establish a battery manufacturing facility with 15 GWh of initial capacity. The company added that collaboration with Northvolt’s prior anchor customers is progressing constructively, and that it plans to rehire a significant portion of the previously laid-off workforce at the acquired facilities, while multiple members of the current Northvolt executive team plan to join Lyten as well.

Additionally, Lyten said that it is committed to pursuing the acquisition of Northvolt Six in Quebec, Canada, which is constructing a 15 GWh battery manufacturing facility, with active discussions progressing with Northvolt North America, the Government of Canada, the Government of Québec, and other stakeholders.

Lyten said that the new acquisition is being fully funded through equity investment into the company from private investors, and that it expects the acquisitions to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to government approvals.

Dan Cook, Lyten CEO and Co-Founder, said:

For a decade now, coal has been on the way out. The industry’s future was considered mainly dead and buried — until the Trump administration decided to pull out every stop to dig it out of the grave. And this wasn’t caused by any “Green New Deal” boogeyman stuff: the coal industry does not have the economics to survive intense competition from less expensive alternatives.

Donald Trump’s efforts to revive coal will cost the U.S. time and money we can’t afford to waste, driving up energy costs for Americans and leaving the mining communities behind.

As we look toward the future, we should not be reaching backward for solutions to our energy supply.

Coal consumption for electricity has been in a steady decline since at least 2008 as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources gained a share of the supply. Coal plants generated only 15 percent of electricity in 2024, down from 19 percent in 2020 and 51 percent in 2001. Based on research from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, coal is expected to continue its steady decline for the remainder of the decade. The institute estimates that by 2030, 63 percent of the peak total of coal-fired capacity will be closed, and it’s possible that all remaining coal capacity still online at that point may be shuttered by 2040.

The arguments people made in the past about coal being economically profitable are no longer applicable. Coal plants and mines are usually decades old, they’re high polluters, and they’re not making a profit. A study from Energy Innovation finds that 99 percent of coal plants are more expensive to run than to replace with new solar or wind energy, and are getting more expensive to run by the day.

The median cost of new solar projects is $24 per megawatt-hour compared to a median marginal cost of $36 for the operations of existing coal plants.

What’s more, this is an industry that, on its way out, has prioritized taking care of its CEOs, not its workers. As major coal companies filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and 2016, executives got massive compensation increases while workers were laid off and employee benefits were slashed. As profits shrank, executives paid themselves more, while miners paid the price.

This is all to say nothing of the public health consequences, environmental damage and climate effects that coal mining and power production pose. Despite making up a minority of electric power generation, coal makes up more than half of all harmful climate emissions from the electric power industry. Coal-fired power plants also have detrimental effects on public health: they were responsible for 460,000 deaths between 1999 and 2020, and they have estimated health costs up to $26 billion annually.

Even as the Trump administration has moved to block permits for wind and solar development and terminated federal clean energy investments that were already underway, it has thrown every subsidy in the book to revive the dying coal industry. In April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at revitalizing the production of coal by opening federal lands to coal leasing and extending the operating life of coal plants across the country. Later that month, he also added coal to his list of “critical minerals” and has used his “energy emergency” as an excuse to push through new mines.

Earlier this summer, Congress enacted a costly taxpayer subsidy for coal mining as part of its budget bill that cut healthcare and clean energy investments. This attempt to prop up coal will come at the expense of people who have to pay higher electricity bills, or question the reliability of their energy.

Coal’s decline was a problem of economics, and its revival only works if Americans are willing to pay more for less. By trying to bring back the coal industry, this administration is fighting the free markets that have shifted away from expensive and polluting coal plants in favor of cheaper, cleaner energy sources.

The Trump administration’s unwavering commitment to fossil fuels threatens to make energy costs higher for Americans while continuing to ignore solutions to energy independence.

The United States should let facts and economic realities take care of coal. What we need to focus on is affordable, abundant and clean energy sources.",https://delawarevalleyjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bigstock-Shovel-And-Coal-154465808-300x300-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:06:23.042498

Clean energy is a growing strength in the Portland regional economy, spanning eight of the area’s 20 primary economic sectors. It’s especially concentrated in construction and technical fields, with construction jobs making up 26% of the sector. Another 21% are split between production occupations (10.8%) and architecture and engineering roles (10.1%). Between 2009 and 2024, the sector’s gross regional product more than doubled in our region, growing from $17.3 billion to $41.8 billion, a 142% increase.*

There are two parts to the clean energy transition: increasing the supply of renewable energy — like solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro — and adapting our buildings, appliances, vehicles, and industrial systems to use energy efficiently and sustainably, and reduce potential burdens on the next generation.

In 2024, there were more than 230,000 clean energy jobs in the greater Portland region, well above the national average of 182,770 for similar-sized cities. Wages in the region also tend to be higher. The average clean energy wage was $119,000 in 2024, 155% of the regional average wage.*

During the past decade, the sector has added more than 42,800 new jobs, an increase of 23%.* View more insights on Worksystems’ Economic Indicator Dashboard.

The Need for a New Generation of Workers

Despite strong growth, the sector faces a workforce challenge. More than one-fifth of clean energy workers in the region are aged 55 or older and nearing retirement, while just 8% are between the ages of 14 and 24. Introducing high school students to clean energy careers could help bridge this gap and ensure a steady pipeline of new talent.

Pathways for Students and Jobseekers

Oregon high school students will soon benefit from a new federally approved Career and Technical Education (CTE) pathway. In response Oregon is designing a CTE pathway in clean energy, connecting students to high-demand careers in solar, EV infrastructure, energy efficiency and other jobs critical to the clean energy transition.

The effort is led by CTE Directors Chris Brida (Portland Public Schools) and Madi Shick (Beaverton School District), with support from the Oregon Department of Education and the Oregon Clean Energy Workforce Coalition. From the outset, the program brings together industry, postsecondary, and community partners to build a scalable, geographically adaptable model. The goal is to equip students for the clean energy transition and position CTE as a systems-level driver of economic mobility and workforce innovation.

For adults beyond high school, Worksystems’ Portland Metro Clean Energy Career Coaching program offers a path into clean energy jobs. Made possible primarily by the Portland Clean Energy Fund, the program supports jobseekers interested in contributing to the clean energy transition. Participants are matched with dedicated career coaches who help them prepare for and pursue careers in climate-critical industries and occupations.

Career coaches are based at seven trusted community organizations: Central City Concern, IRCO, POIC, SE Works, Our Just Future, The Urban League of Portland, and Latino Network. Participants can access a range of supports, including funding for tuition and training-related costs, work tools and clothing, wraparound services, and employment connection support through WorkSource Portland Metro’s On-the-Job Training program.

Those unobligated grant funds amounted to only $19 million, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) when it conducted its analysis of the pending legislation’s overall financial impact.","The Trump administration has officially announced it is killing the $7 billion Solar for All program. The program had awarded grants to 60 state agencies, municipalities, tribal governments, and nonprofits across the country to help low-income households access solar power. Supporters of Solar for All are vowing to fight the move in court.

On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin posted a video on the X social media platform stating that he was terminating the program. Solar for All was created as part of the Inflation Reduction Act’s $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), which has also been under attack by the Trump administration.

Zeldin stated that the mega-law passed by Republicans in Congress last month ​“eliminates billions of green slush-fund dollars by repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.”

Referring specifically to Solar for All, Zeldin said, ​“EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program, or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive. With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good.”

Defenders of Solar for All challenge Zeldin’s interpretation of the One Big Beautiful Bill, or HR 1, and the intent of its provisions.

“It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that HR 1 rescinded these funds, because they were all under legally obligated grant awards when the bill was signed,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit coalition of attorneys, law students, and activists that’s challenging other EPA funding cuts. ​“HR 1 only rescinded unobligated grant funds,” she told Canary Media on Thursday.

That’s an important distinction, she said. Those unobligated grant funds amounted to only $19 million, as determined by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) when it conducted its analysis of the pending legislation’s overall financial impact. The vast majority of the funds, the office found, were already committed under legally binding contracts to the parties awarded grants during the Biden administration.

But in a court case challenging the EPA’s effort to claw back $20 billion in funds for other GGRF programs, administration officials have claimed that HR 1 terminates the government’s obligation to meet any of its contractual obligations.

Attorneys for nonprofit groups fighting EPA’s attempt to claw back their grants argued that the law clearly states that only ​“unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out that section … are rescinded.”

The attorneys also noted that Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican and chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, stated during a congressional debate before the bill passed that funding ​“that’s already been obligated and out the door, that’s a decision that’s final,” and that arguing the law would claw back obligated funding is ​“a ridiculous thought.”

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) pointed out this same discrepancy in a July press release attacking EPA’s characterization of the law. ​“Trump’s DOJ is continuing its mischief by falsely claiming Republicans’ Big Beautiful-for-Billionaires Bill claws back $17 billion from GGRF, even though the CBO score for the unobligated funds was $19 million — what was left to oversee the program after the grant funds had been obligated — and Republicans made clear that their rescissions only touched unobligated funding,” Whitehouse wrote.

The Solar for All program is meant to deliver energy-bill savings of $350 million over the next five years to 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households and deploy 4 gigawatts of solar generation capacity. In the past few months, a handful of grantees had begun issuing awards to low-income housing projects, municipal facilities, nonprofits, and low-income homeowners.

“Communities promised relief from punishing energy costs are now left in the dark,” Zealan Hoover, a former EPA senior advisor under the Biden administration, told Canary Media. ​“Nearly a million families will pay hundreds of dollars more each year for their electricity bill because the Trump administration killed a program that would have more than paid for itself.”

Michelle Moore, CEO of Groundswell, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit that is administering a $156 million Solar for All grant aimed at developing large-scale solar and battery projects in Southeastern states, said that ending the program would run counter to President Donald Trump’s pledge to lower energy prices.

“I would hope [the Office of Management and Budget] could find the funding to cover EPA staff time to help keep President Trump’s campaign promise to cut bills in half and keep energy affordable for American families, which this program does,” she told Canary Media.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Groundswell-DC_StLuke_two-people-solar-roof.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0a7a23512fb4d3f1c8bec82066aaa637,N,,2025-08-08 13:06:46.231454

The moves are expected to create issues for the renewable energy industry, and critics argue that they could raise power prices.

“If you’re a rational Republican senator who wants to keep the lights on [and] keep electricity affordable, these are terrible policies,” said Leah Stokes, an environmental politics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” slashed incentives for wind and solar energy that were part of the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to significantly stifle the build-out of the growing industry.

And in recent weeks, his administration has taken further actions to hamper wind and solar power.

Shortly after the bill passed, Trump directed the Treasury Department to take a strict approach in limiting which projects are eligible for the remaining tax credits.

The Interior Department also recently announced that it would subject wind and solar projects to an elevated review process — a move that was expected to slow down their approvals.

These reviews would pertain not only to wind and solar farm approvals but also include a wide range of activities such as grants and assessments of endangered species impacts.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Solar Energy Industry Association, said he expects that some of these reviews would not only delay projects on public lands but could have similar effects on projects that are on private lands.

“We are hearing about dozens, if not hundreds of projects in the aggregate that otherwise are totally sited on private lands, totally permitted by state and local authorities, but that the Interior Department seems to have found a way to put into limbo, at least for a time,” Norris told The Hill.

Meanwhile, the Interior Department said last week that it would try to block projects that take up a lot of room, which is expected to primarily hurt solar and wind projects. And, the department said last week that it would weigh “whether to stop onshore wind development on some federal lands and halting future offshore wind lease sales.”

It also moved this week to try to cancel an already approved wind project in Idaho.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday separately announced it would move to claw back funds under a $7 billion rooftop solar program.

Norris said that “without a doubt, we have concerns” about the administration’s policies. But, he also expressed some optimism about the future.

“Despite this kind of initial onslaught, we’re not aware of anything that has been canceled. There are certainly some unexpected delays, but that’s kind of part and parcel of developing big infrastructure projects,” he said when asked about the administration’s recent policies. “The fundamentals in terms of supply and demand for solar remain outstanding.”

Stokes had similar sentiments, noting the significance of the tax credits in the Democrats’ 2022 law.

“We still made two steps forward. Maybe we’re one step back. We’re still one step forward,” she said. “You can’t uninstall all the solar and batteries that went in, in the last three years.”

President Trump has long expressed disdain for renewable energy, especially wind. He said before taking office that he’d like to see no new wind energy be constructed during his tenure.

However, negotiations over the “big, beautiful bill” revealed a split within the Republican Party about how aggressively to target renewable energy incentives.

As moderate lawmakers managed to get some concessions to slow the termination of green tax credits, Trump apparently promised to go after renewable energy through the executive branch. That’s what led to last month’s directive to the Treasury Department, instructing it to restrict provisions that protect the industry “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

This week, that effort met pushback from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and John Curtis (R-Utah), who placed holds on Trump nominees over concerns about what could fall under the Treasury Department rule.

“Until I can be certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the law and congressional intent, I intend to continue to object to the consideration of these Treasury nominees,” Grassley said in a statement in the congressional record.

Grassley and Curtis are not the only ones pushing back. Politico Pro reported this week that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lament that administration policies have “frozen” solar projects.

Meanwhile, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who championed major cuts to renewable incentives, said “Ignore them,” referring to Grassley and Curtis, in a social media post.

The Trump administration’s agenda has called for the general expansion of fossil fuels as well as power-hungry data centers while it has cemented hurdles for renewables.

However, Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate at BNEF, said policies that are bad for renewables don’t clear the way for other types of energy to come online to replace it, meaning power prices could rise.

“Material availability of other technologies is pretty bottlenecked right now,” Flakoll said. “There’s a lot of wind and solar and storage. It’s cheap. You can build it quickly, so I don’t know that it really clears the way for much.”",https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/08/Barriers_080825_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-08 12:12:56.044581

In a stunning reversal, the Japanese auto giant has announced it is rethinking its electrification strategy, signaling that battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are no longer the holy grail of its future.

The move is a major setback for the EV industry, which is already reeling from the September 30 expiration of federal tax credits that made electric cars competitive with their gas-powered counterparts. For years, the auto industry, mesmerized by the success of Tesla, has been in an arms race to go all-electric. Now, one of its biggest players is pumping the brakes. Hard.

“BEVs are not the goal, better electric vehicles are a pathway to achieving carbon neutral, not necessarily the only pathway,” Honda Australia president and CEO, Jay Joseph, recently told the publication Drive. “BEVs will continue to improve, we’re working on solid-state batteries, but our goal is carbon neutral, not battery electric vehicles.”

His statement confirms a dramatic strategic shift that Honda executives laid out during an August 6 press conference. They are no longer betting the farm on an all-electric future.

A Nightmarish Reality

The reason for the pivot is simple: Honda’s EV strategy has been a financial nightmare. During the press conference, Honda Managing Executive Officer Eiji Fujimura admitted that they are “not very optimistic” about the EV market, citing the impact of the expiring Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits and a general “cooling down of the market.” The company is “struggling with the sales of EV this year series,” Fujimura said, and needs to “expedite actions” to meet consumer expectations.

The financial results tell the real story. Honda’s latest quarter was hammered by a one-time charge of 113.4 billion yen ($780 million) directly linked to its EV business. This included losses on EVs sold in the United States and a massive write-off of assets for EV models the company is now scrapping from its future lineup. The company now expects its full-year EV-related expenses to hit a staggering 650 billion yen ($4.47 billion).

Honda currently sells two EV models in the U.S., the Honda Prologue and the Acura ZDX. To sell them, the company has been forced to offer massive incentives. According to industry data from Motor Intelligence cited by Automotive News, Honda spent an average of more than $12,000 in promotions on each Prologue and an eye-watering $21,000 on each ZDX it sold last quarter.

Even with these huge discounts, the company’s market share has declined.

The Pivot to Hybrids and Hydrogen

These struggles are compounded by the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, a subsidy that helped convince many consumers to make the costly switch. Without it, the high sticker price of EVs and the lack of reliable charging infrastructure in many parts of the country become even bigger obstacles.

Faced with this brutal reality, Honda is turning to a strategy that, until recently, was mocked by EV purists. To achieve its carbon neutrality goals, the company will now lean heavily on hybrid vehicles, joining Toyota, whose cautious, hybrid-first approach was seen as outdated just a few years ago. Now, it looks prescient. A recent report from GlobalData indicated that between 2025 and 2035, virtually every popular Honda model in America would be offered as a hybrid.

“I think at some point we’re going to be all-hybrid, all-electrified, but this is just another step in that particular transition,” Joseph confirmed to Drive.

Honda is also exploring hydrogen-powered Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), which convert hydrogen into electricity onboard. While FCEVs face their own infrastructure and cost challenges, they produce only water vapor as emissions.

Our Take

Just a few years ago, BEVs were the industry’s obsession and the clear symbol of the race to decarbonize. Now, Honda’s retreat marks a new reality: the path to carbon neutrality is looking more complicated, and the BEV-only strategy is no longer sacred.

Honda’s move doesn’t just affect its own lineup. It sends a warning signal across the auto industry that the EV growth story is hitting limits. If one of the world’s largest automakers is hedging its bets, other companies might follow, slowing the shift away from fossil fuels at a critical moment for climate goals.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2021/02/o09tsaz9fjspqdpjhoiq.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 09:59:57.381896

Technews Industry Guide: Sustainable Manufacturing 2025 Editor's Choice Electrical Power & Protection

Wave energy is emerging as one of the most promising yet underutilised renewable sources. Tapping into the rhythmic, predictable power of ocean waves, this technology offers a clean, reliable alternative to fossil fuels and a valuable complement to wind and solar energy. With oceans covering over 70% of the Earth’s surface, the sheer scale of this resource is immense. If effectively harnessed, wave energy could meet a significant share of global electricity demand, especially for countries with long coastlines.

The engineering promise of wave energy

Unlike solar or wind, wave energy is far more consistent. Waves are not as subject to daily or seasonal fluctuations, making it a more reliable form of generation. The density of water also means wave energy has a much higher power potential per square metre than either solar or wind. However, the engineering challenges are equally significant. Devices must operate in corrosive saltwater environments, withstand storms and minimise impact on marine ecosystems.

Wave energy converters come in a variety of forms − point absorbers, oscillating water columns, overtopping devices and attenuators, to name a few. These systems convert the kinetic and potential energy of waves into mechanical motion and then into electricity. Progress in materials science, control systems and offshore construction methods is making them more robust, efficient and cost-competitive.

Mutriku Wave Power Plant

Spain’s Mutriku Wave Power Plant, located in the Basque Country, represents one of the most successful and longest-operating commercial wave energy projects in the world. Commissioned in 2011, this plant cleverly integrates oscillating water column technology into a breakwater structure in a dual-purpose design that protects the harbour while generating clean energy.

The Mutriku facility houses 16 air turbines, each powered by the rise and fall of seawater in enclosed chambers. As waves move in and out, they push air through the turbines, generating electricity. While the 300 kW power output is modest by utility standards, the significance lies in its continuous operation and the lessons it offers in system reliability, turbine design and grid integration.

The Mutriku plant demonstrates how wave energy infrastructure can be embedded into existing coastal developments. This reduces environmental impact and construction costs, offering a scalable model for other ports and coastal cities. “We’re not just generating electricity, we’re proving that wave power can be part of everyday infrastructure,” says project engineer, Iker Goiria.

Carnegie Clean Energy

In contrast to surface-based devices, Australia’s Carnegie Clean Energy developed a fully submerged wave energy technology known as CETO, named after a Greek sea goddess. Situated off the coast of Western Australia, CETO units are tethered to the seabed and operate several metres below the surface, making them invisible, storm-resistant and less intrusive to marine life and shipping.

Each CETO buoy moves with wave motion, driving hydraulic pumps that send pressurised water ashore through subsea pipelines. This high-pressure water is then used to generate electricity via a conventional hydroelectric system or to produce freshwater via desalination.

Unlike wind and solar, which require separate systems for water treatment, the CETO system combines both energy generation and desalination into a single compact, modular platform. “The ocean is relentless, so our technology has to be just as resilient,” says the lead CETO designer at Carnegie Clean Energy.

Scaling up

Wave energy is still in the early stages of commercial development and scaling up is a major challenge. High capital costs, harsh offshore conditions and limited deployment experience have slowed its adoption. Additionally, unlike wind or solar, there are few standardised technologies, with developers often having to come up with proprietary designs.

Nevertheless, governments and private investors are beginning to take notice. The European Union has set ambitious marine energy targets, with wave energy expected to contribute to a more decentralised, resilient energy mix. The USA Department of Energy is investing in test facilities like the PacWave site in Oregon, which aims to accelerate the commercial viability of marine energy technologies.

Emerging synergies with offshore wind farms, aquaculture and hydrogen production also make wave energy increasingly attractive. Shared infrastructure such as subsea cables and platforms can reduce costs and environmental footprints. Hybrid systems that combine wave, solar and wind could also offer continuous, balanced power generation in changing weather conditions.

A blue horizon

With countries struggling to meet their Net-Zero goals, wave energy offers an opportunity to diversify the renewable energy mix. Despite the hurdles, the potential benefits − predictable output, coastal job creation and technological innovation − are too significant to ignore. With supportive policy, continued R&D; and smart integration into existing maritime infrastructure, wave energy could play a role in the global shift towards sustainability.

In 2024, only BloombergNEF and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) correctly projected that the U.S. would install around 50 GW of solar.","Amid policy uncertainty—and perhaps even because of it—the U.S. is expected to continue its record-setting pace of solar capacity deployments through at least 2027—right up until it hits the dual barriers of “Foreign Entities of Concern” (FEOC) restrictions and the scheduled phase-out of key solar tax credits.

BloombergNEF’s Jenny Chase told pv magazine USA that the group projects U.S. solar photovoltaic installations of 53.1 GW in 2025, rising to 61.1 GW in 2026. In 2027, installations are expected to dip slightly to 59.8 GW before plunging to 32.2 GW in 2028.

These projections assume that FEOC-related regulations will present significant headwinds, limiting developers’ access to qualifying components.

BloombergNEF offers a more optimistic scenario in which the industry navigates FEOC challenges more effectively. Chase and her team suggest that while 2025 and 2026 are likely to proceed as currently projected, 2027 could see a modest boost to 62.6 GW of solar deployed. Most notably, instead of a nearly 50% drop in 2028, capacity additions could remain relatively strong at 56 GW.

From there, installations are expected to rise again, albeit under a revised policy environment.

Broadly speaking, BloombergNEF anticipates that in the FEOC-constrained scenario, total wind, solar, and storage deployments will fall by 41% in 2028.

The 41% drop translates to 48 GW deployed in 2028, down from 81 GW in 2027.

Looking through 2030, BNEF now expects cumulative wind, solar, and storage deployments to be 23% lower than in previous forecasts, primarily due to changes to the Inflation Reduction Act. The new analysis projects a 50% reduction in new onshore wind capacity, a 23% decline in solar, and a 7% drop in energy storage installations.

Financial analysis firm Enverus also flagged concerns. It estimates that once the investment tax credit expires, “only 30% of planned solar projects will be able to deliver competitive prices and are ‘expected to survive.’” The firm finds that more than half of planned wind farms will remain competitive by 2027.

Energy storage is expected to weather the changes better than wind and solar. Its projected 7% decline is modest, largely because the tax credit for standalone storage was not only retained but extended an additional year—now expiring at the end of 2033.

The greatest challenge to energy storage will be FEOC restrictions, under which the maximum allowed foreign share (known as the threshold percentage) is set at 45% for projects that begin construction in 2026. That threshold tightens by 5 percentage points each year, reaching 25% for all projects beginning after 2029.

In 2024, only BloombergNEF and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) correctly projected that the U.S. would install around 50 GW of solar. Other groups initially forecast closer to 40 GW, later revising their estimates upward in early 2025.

Smart economics is the driving factor for global renewable adoption. That is the argument behind a recent speech titled “A Moment of Opportunity” from UN Secretary General António Guterres. Describing how “we are on the cusp of a new era” of powering our lives, Guterres celebrates how the precipitous drop in the cost of renewables has supported sector expansion. It’s to the point that renewables now almost match fossil fuels in terms of global installed power capacity.

That is good news. But Guterres is also darkly pragmatic, reminding us that “the headlines are dominated by a world in trouble. By conflict and climate chaos. By rising human suffering. By growing geopolitical divides.” Fossil fuels have the benefit of a 9-to-1 advantage in consumption subsidies globally — “a clear market distortion. Add to that the unaccounted costs of climate damages on people and planet — and the distortion is even greater,” he asserts.

Yet this turmoil doesn’t have to continue, he explains, for the human history of harnessing energy is being rewritten — “and its implications will be profound.” With the power of the sun, a new age of clean energy is upon us, and “fossil fuels are running out of road,” as the “cost competitiveness of renewables is today’s reality.”

Acknowledging that the energy transformation “is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security,” Guterres introduces the primary reason that the world has begun to embrace clean energy. “It’s about smart economics.”

To illustrate how “we have passed the point of no return,” Guterres lists “three powerful reasons” why our clean energy future is not just a promise. “It’s a fact.”

Market economics.

The decades where emissions and economic growth rose together are no longer. “In many advanced economies, emissions have peaked, but growth continues,” Guterres points out.

The cost of renewable energy technologies has fallen over the past decade, with 96% of new solar and wind now costing less than new coal and gas plants.

The global average cost of solar PV has fallen to $0.043 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and onshore wind to $0.034/kWh.

In 2023 alone, clean energy sectors drove 10% of global GDP growth. That means India: 5%. US: 6%. China: 20%. EU: 33%.

Clean energy sector jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs — employing almost 35 million people worldwide.

Texas — the heart of the American fossil fuel industry — now leads the US in renewables because it makes economic sense.

The 582 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity added to the global energy system in 2024 helped avoid fossil-fuel use valued at about $57 billion, with further cost savings expected as the sector continues to grow.

“Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies — they are sabotaging them,” Guterres insists. “Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking-in stranded assets. And missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.”

Energy security and sovereignty.

Guterres describes how renewables mean “real energy security. Real energy sovereignty. And real freedom from fossil-fuel volatility.”

Long-term cost reductions are expected to continue, as further technological lessons are learned and supply chains mature.

Renewable energy capacity has increased significantly over the past decade, growing by around 2,600GW, or 140%, between 2015 and 2024.

In 2024 alone, renewables made up 92.5% of all new electricity capacity additions, as well as 74% of electricity generation growth.

The number of jobs in the clean energy sector has also continued to grow, reaching 34.8 million in 2023, of which 16,2000 were in the renewables sector.

The clean energy sector added $320 billion to the global economy, or 10% of GDP growth globally.

“Let’s be clear: The greatest threat to energy security today is in fossil fuels,” Guterres insists.

Easy access.

“Renewables can put power — literally and figuratively,” Guterres outlines, “in the hands of people and governments.”

The share of global installed capacity is now nearly a 1:1 ratio between fossil fuels and renewables.

Around 74% of the global population lives in a country that is a net importer of fossil fuels, leaving them vulnerable when oil and gas prices surge.

In 2024, renewable energy helped “avoid” $467 billion in fossil fuel costs globally.

In the US, during that time, 93% of new generating capacity came from solar, wind, and an ever-increasing variety of batteries to store that power.

“You can’t build a coal plant in someone’s backyard,” he instructs. “But you can deliver solar panels to the most remote village on earth. Solar and wind can be deployed faster, cheaper and more flexibly than fossil fuels ever could.”

Final Thoughts about the Smart Economics of Renewables

In his speech, Guterres implores, “We must drastically speed up the reduction of emissions — and the reach of the clean energy transition” to reach these goals, as the “1.5 C limit is in unprecedented peril.”

After generating 50.5% of US utility-supplied electricity in March, clean energy sources accounted for 50.8% of electricity in April. As our CleanTechnica colleague, Steve Hanley, writes, “US solar power continues to grow as storm clouds gather.” For the smart economics of renewables to resonate in the US, the federal government needs to awaken to the power and pledge of clean energy.

Increased national productivity is a key ingredient of sustained growth. Nonetheless, while promising an all-of-the-above energy mix, Trump and his merry pranksters have done everything in their power to halt the exponential rise of solar and wind energy projects. No longer can or should convoluted diatribes that prop up fossil fuel profits reign. Researchers have projected the percentage that clean energy can power the grid over the next decade or so, and the numbers are impressive.

Coal power is declining fast, and will continue to do so, with 24,373 MW set to retire in the next three years. Another theory — that renewables should serve as a transition solution toward expanding natural gas generation — is absurd and needs to be deconstructed every time it is uttered.

On the other hand, despite a renewed effort to prop up the shrinking US coal industry, renewable energy projects keep on attracting global energy investors.

Climate activist and author of a new book, Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization, Bill McKibben reminds us in the US, “We live on a planet where, all of a sudden, the cheapest way to make energy is to point a sheet of glass at the sun.” It’s time to listen to McKibben, Gutteres, and others who are revealing the reality of clean energy for our future.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/smart-economics.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 12:10:12.575679

The Wall Street Journal reports the imports will serve as a two-year stopgap while GM and its Korean partner LG Energy Solution ramp up U.S.-based battery production.

The new Bolt, expected to begin production at GM’s Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas by late 2025 and arrive at dealerships in 2026, will retail around $30,000, making it a key part of GM’s strategy to deliver a lower-cost EV amid a highly competitive and price-sensitive market.

While GM has emphasized U.S. battery manufacturing in recent years, executives acknowledge that domestic supply chain limitations and the maturity of China’s LFP battery expertise make temporary imports necessary. The LFP chemistry, although originally developed in the U.S., is now largely commercialized and perfected in China. Despite the roughly 80% import duties on Chinese batteries, GM aims to keep the new Bolt profitable, or close to it, until its U.S. supply comes online by 2027.

Here’s why it matters:

This development has significant implications for dealers awaiting the return of GM’s most affordable EV. The decision to import LFP batteries from China ensures the new Bolt won’t be delayed, giving dealers a low-price EV option to attract cost-conscious buyers. It also signals GM’s flexible, cost-driven approach to EV strategy during a volatile policy environment. With the federal EV tax credit ending next month, the Bolt won’t be penalized for using Chinese components, leveling the playing field. Dealers should prepare for increased demand around the new Bolt’s launch, especially from first-time EV buyers and price-sensitive segments.

Key takeaways

GM turns to China’s CATL for Bolt batteries

The automaker will source low-cost LFP batteries from CATL for about two years to support its next-gen Chevrolet Bolt production.

Bolt production resumes in Kansas

The new model will be GM’s most affordable EV, which can be expected to start around $30,000 and hit dealerships in 2026.

Tariffs won’t block GM’s pricing strategy

Despite 80% import duties, GM expects the Bolt to remain marginally profitable, especially with cheaper LFP battery chemistry.

Tax credit changes ease compliance pressure

With the $7,500 EV credit ending next month, GM avoids penalties it would have faced for using Chinese-made components in the Bolt.

“With the balance of the land, we will not be developing it with anything else – we hope to find a tenant farmer,” explained Gahman.

In terms of a timeline, Aypa Power commenced project development in 2022, where it filed an interconnection request with the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and also secured a real estate agreement.

From there, the developer started its environmental, engineering, and due diligence in 2024 and commenced BESS safety training with Hamilton County Emergency Management and Fire Departments this year.

All being well, Gahman explained that Aypa Power was targeting a 9–12-month construction period commencing sometime towards the end of 2027.

BESS fire safety a focus of presentation

With the potential of BESS fires continuing to be a hot topic of discussion during the local permitting process across the US, Gahman made this a focus of his presentation.

Energy-Storage.news has reported on several local permitting processes taking place across North America this year, including ones administered by the Town of Oakham in Massachusetts and the Canadian Capital City of Ottawa, where BESS fire safety has taken centre stage.

In particular, Gahman highlighted standards NFPA 855 and UL 9540A, which he explained were mandatory fire safety standards in the BESS industry and that “compliance is required by the Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS) to whom we must obtain multiple permits.”

As part of the IDHS administered permits, Aypa Power’s project will be subjected to a further fire safety review along with an on-site BESS safety training course.

“This is a multiple day training [course] that is paid for by us and would involve [the creation] of a very specific site plan and emergency response plan in collaboration with County first responders,” explained Gahman.

Although Aypa Power’s application doesn’t list a BESS supplier specifically, technical drawings of the project are based upon usage of Canadian Solar subsidiary e-STORAGE’s SolarBank 3.0.

The two have a history of working together and as reported by Energy-Storage.news earlier this year, Aypa Power secured a deal for e-Storage to deploy its SolarBank BESS units at two of its sites elsewhere in the US.

Moss Landing: ‘Blueprint for how not to build a battery storage project’

As acknowledged by Gahman during his presentation, the most high-profile fire incident to occur at a battery storage facility was at Vistra’s Moss Landing facility in Monterey County, California.

With residents of Hamilton County fearing a repeat of this sort of incident, Gahman dedicated a whole portion of his presentation comparing Moss Landing to Aypa Power’s Kingfisher proposal.

“[Moss Landing] was a blueprint for exactly how you do not want to construct a battery energy storage system,” he explained.

Although an investigation into the cause of the fire is still ongoing, Gahman explained how Vistra’s facility was “indoors with a wide array of racks and modules under one roof … with nothing in between them to stop any [fire] propagation.”

Vistra’s Moss Landing facility also utilised lithium nickel manganese cobalt battery technology which Gahman described as “more volatile” than other chemistries such as LFP.

The cleanup at Moss Landing is still ongoing, with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Vistra coming to an agreement last month for the developer to remove debris from the site.

MISO capacity shortfalls

As recently reported by Energy-Storage.news, a recent report from American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Aurora Energy Research found that MISO will need a 500% rise in BESS deployment by 2035 to address shortfalls.

Gahman highlighted this during the recent meeting by bringing up MISO’s most recent Regional Resource Assessment (RRA), which predicts a 6GW capacity shortfall for the system operator’s Local Resource Zone 6 (LRZ6), which covers Indiana and parts of Kentucky.

This capacity shortfall is being partially driven by the gradual shutdown of MISO’s fleet of fossil fuel plants, including Duke Energy Indiana’s Noblesville gas plant, which is located adjacent to the proposed site for Aypa Power’s Kingfisher BESS and is set to be retired before 2035.

Although the shutdown of these polluting facilities is fantastic for net-zero ambitions, MISO currently doesn’t have the capacity to cover the shortfalls left by these plants, which is why proposals such as Aypa Power’s Kingfisher BESS could be vital.

Despite these facts, after hearing from over 30 residents speaking out against the project, the ZBA voted unanimously to reject Aypa Power’s application.

Ford in general has pulled back from all-electric vehicles, as has GM and other automakers, while Toyota hit the bullseye on hybrids surging in popularity.

Trump bashes Jaguar for its rebranding strategy.

The two delayed Ford products are a next-generation all-electric full-size truck we presume is the successor to the F-150 Lightning and an all-electric commercial van which appeared to be the new E-Transit. Both models have been delayed to a 2028 launch date, reports The Detroit News.

Last year, Ford said the pickup truck was going to be launched in 2027 while the commercial van was coming for 2026. We wonder if the revised launch dates won’t be pushed back again.

Ford has lost $2,178,000,000 on EVs so far in 2025. This delay might be a good thing.

Not too long ago, GM officially announced its Orion Township assembly plant is transitioning from the plan to just pump out EVs to make gas-powered full-size trucks and SUVs. The reason for the change is simple: people want big trucks and SUVs powered by internal combustion engines, not electric cars.

That fact angers EV proponents and climate change prophets of doom, but they both have failed to make their case to the public.

While EV demand was already falling, with the sunsetting of policies which would’ve pushed consumers into begrudgingly buying them, the market has even more sharply turned away from them. In other words, electric cars were selling in part because some people felt they should get on board before they were forced to buy one.

Now things are changing rapidly.

Automakers should be thanking the public for taking the pressure off them. After all, Ford and others have lost big money on producing EVs as they also were getting pushed by the federal government into the electrification transition before it became profitable.

Maybe now mass EV adoption, if it ever does happen, won’t be an industry and societal disaster.

As the U.S. scrambles to reduce its reliance on foreign supply chains for critical minerals, companies like Standard Lithium (SLI) are emerging as linchpins in the race for energy security. With geopolitical tensions, decarbonization mandates, and a surging EV market driving demand, SLI's Arkansas and Texas projects—coupled with its cutting-edge DLE technology and strategic alliances—position it as a must-own asset for investors navigating the energy transition.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: Lithium as a National Security Priority

The U.S. Department of Energy's $225 million grant to Standard Lithium's South West Arkansas (SWA) project in 2024 underscores the federal government's urgency to secure domestic lithium production. This funding, part of the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) broader push for clean energy independence, reflects a stark reality: the U.S. currently imports over 90% of its lithium, much of it from China and Argentina. Standard Lithium's Smackover Formation projects in Arkansas and Texas, however, offer a solution.

The Smackover Formation, a geological marvel stretching across the southern U.S., contains brine with lithium concentrations rivaling the world's top deposits. In 2025, the SWA project achieved a record 616 mg/L lithium grade in brine—a 23% jump from initial estimates—proving the asset's commercial viability. With Arkansas now approving its first lithium royalty rate (2.5% plus a $65.05/acre annual fee), SLI is setting a regulatory precedent that could catalyze a lithium boom in the region.

Sustainable Extraction Innovation: DLE's Triple Win

Standard Lithium's Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology, developed in partnership with Koch Technology Solutions, is redefining the economics and environmental footprint of lithium production. Unlike traditional evaporation ponds, which require years and vast land use, DLE enables rapid, high-purity lithium recovery with minimal water consumption.

In March 2025, the SWA project's DLE pilot plant achieved a 99% lithium recovery rate—surpassing its 95% target—while processing 100,000 gallons of brine in just three months. This milestone, combined with the demonstration plant in El Dorado (which has processed 28 million gallons since 2020), validates DLE's scalability. The technology's ability to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate (970 gallons of 6% LiCl solution in 2025) directly addresses the “sustainability” leg of the lithium trilemma, offering a cleaner alternative to hard-rock mining and salt flat evaporation.

Strategic Partnerships: Equinor's Energy Transition Playbook

Standard Lithium's 50-50 joint venture with Equinor—a global energy giant transitioning from oil to renewables—adds another layer of credibility. Equinor's subsurface expertise and $225 million DoE grant have accelerated SWA's path to commercialization, with first production targeted for 2027. The partnership also leverages Equinor's infrastructure and sustainability frameworks, aligning with the IRA's emphasis on low-carbon supply chains.

Meanwhile, the Phase 1A project in Union County, Arkansas, a brownfield initiative extracting lithium from bromine tail brine, is already in the final stages of its feasibility study. With a projected 5,400 tonnes/year capacity and $365 million in capex, this project could serve as a near-term cash flow generator, de-risking the broader portfolio.

Texas Expansion: The Next Frontier

While Arkansas steals the spotlight, Standard Lithium's Texas operations are equally compelling. The Smackover Lithium JV has secured 185,000 acres of leases in East Texas, including a 67,000-acre core area with a historic 806 mg/L lithium grade—the highest in North America. A maiden Inferred Resource Report, due in Q3 2025, could unlock billions in value.

The company's DLE technology, already proven in Arkansas, will be deployed here, ensuring rapid commercialization. With Texas's robust energy infrastructure and regulatory familiarity, Standard Lithium is poised to replicate its Arkansas success, creating a dual-state production hub.

Investment Thesis: A Trilemma Solution

Standard Lithium's value proposition lies in its ability to solve the lithium trilemma:

1. Security: Domestic production in politically stable regions.

2. Cost: DLE's efficiency reduces CAPEX and operating costs.

3. Sustainability: Minimal water use and carbon footprint.

With a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) for the SWA project due in Q3 2025 and a Final Investment Decision (FID) by year-end, the company is on track for a 2027 production start. At 22,500 tonnes/year of battery-grade lithium carbonate, the SWA project alone could capture 5% of the U.S. market by 2030—a figure that grows with Texas's potential.

Conclusion: A Must-Own for Energy Transition Portfolios

For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition, Standard Lithium represents a rare convergence of geopolitical tailwinds, technological innovation, and strategic execution. Its Arkansas projects are nearing commercialization, Texas offers vast upside, and its DLE technology is a game-changer in a sector desperate for sustainable solutions.

With the U.S. aiming for 100% EV sales by 2035 and lithium demand projected to grow 10x by 2030, SLI is not just a lithium producer—it's a cornerstone of American energy independence. As the SWA project moves toward FID and Texas's resource potential crystallizes, now is the time to position for a long-term winner in the race to decarbonize the grid and the automotive industry.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-08 12:13:31.547773

The impact of a record-breaking, life-threatening heat dome on the U.S. coincided with the worst science denial in the 400 years since the Inquisition made the astronomer Galileo Galilei recant his belief that the Earth orbits the sun.

He would have been burned at the stake for insisting on the truth. Giordano Bruno, a like-minded heretic, already had been just a few years earlier. Nobody’s life but Galileo’s was at stake in his historic clash between religious dogma and scientific fact.

But millions, if not billions, of lives are imperiled today by the Trump administration’s announced intent to revoke the government’s 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which warm the planet, endanger public health.

To erase that fact from the public record is to eliminate the government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from any sources, whether cars or power plants, along with any incentive to encourage solar, wind and nuclear energy and other climate-friendly production methods.

That regulation allows the Environmental Protection Agency to invoke the Clean Air Act to control greenhouse gases.

Where greed is good

Lee Zeldin, President Trump’s agent of destruction at the EPA, cited a report from five climate change skeptics at the Department of Energy who dispute the overwhelming consensus of scientists worldwide.

They were brought in, like Zeldin, to promote Trump’s dogma that government regulation is bad and greed is good.

As a congressman from Long Island, N.Y., Zeldin joined a bipartisan climate change caucus and voted against an amendment to prohibit the EPA from controlling greenhouse gases.

That was then. Now, as Trump’s nominee to run the EPA, he said he would drive “a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.”

Power and greed are companions in corruption.

The greed of conventional automakers and of the coal, gas and petroleum industries, along with the enormous sums of money they invest in pliable politicians, are the forces driving the war on science that has overtaken state capitals like Florida’s and the U.S. government.

Going to hell, metaphorically

Burning is an appropriate metaphor for humanity’s fate if global temperatures continue to soar.

Heat has been killing more Americans than any other weather phenomena — more than 4,800 over the past two years, the CDC reports. More than 5,000 died in France last year. There are limits to what the human body can bear, and some places are fast approaching those limits.

People in Broward don’t have to ask how hot it got here last week.

The heat index — what it actually feels like — topped 100. Across the state, Tampa recorded its first-ever reading of 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

On July 28, the nation set a one-day record for electrical consumption, driven by demand for air-conditioning (which merely transfers heat from one place to another).

Heat death statistics, usually undercounted, don’t reflect how a hotter climate is also killing people through heavier and more frequent floods and wildfires that cost the economy trillions of dollars over time in damage to homes, businesses, public infrastructure and agricultural crops.

Are anyone’s short-term profits worth such an enormous price?

Zeldin chose a truck dealership in Indianapolis to boast that the EPA’s proposal “would, if finalized, amount to the largest deregulation action in the history of the United States.”

Also the most reckless and indefensible.

The United States seems to be the only major nation that’s in the grip of such mercenary and selfish dogma. Most other national leaders take climate change as an existential threat to humanity, which it is.

It’s one reason why China, which pumps the most greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, is also making itself a world leader in the electric vehicles for which the U.S. is now canceling incentives.

The United States is the second-largest greenhouse gas polluter. Without our participation, it is inconceivable that the nations that still respect science will be able to meet the goal, to which the U.S. once subscribed, of preventing average global temperatures from rising more than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels.

Because the 2009 declaration is a regulation, Zeldin can’t just pronounce it dead. He has to publish the repeal in the Federal Register and accept public comments before putting it into effect. Litigation is certain and emphatically called for. Everyone is entitled to comment. Everyone should.

“Today’s EPA announcement,” said former Vice President Al Gore, a pioneer in defending the planet, “ignores the blindingly obvious reality of the climate crisis and sidelines the EPA’s own scientists and lawyers in favor of the interests and profits of the fossil fuel industry.”

It’s easier to comprehend their short-term greed than to understand why they don’t seem to care that their children and grandchildren will inherit the unlivable planet they’re making of the only home of the human race.

E-Cite Motors Group (OTCID:VAPR) announced today that it has narrowed the final location candidates for its U.S. electric vehicle final assembly plant to four states: Michigan, Ohio, Florida, and Nevada. Following a detailed evaluation process, these states emerged as front-runners based on key business criteria including affordable real estate, availability of a skilled workforce, strong state and local incentives, tax advantages, and overall livability.

This decision marks a pivotal step in E-Cite's U.S. production strategy as the company prepares to scale manufacturing for its next-generation EV lineup.

Strategic Evaluation Criteria & Industry Context

Cost-Effective Real Estate and Operations: Each of the four finalist states offers favorable land, utility, and operating costs-critical factors in high-efficiency vehicle production. Nevada and Florida in particular offer exceptional savings in property, labor, and energy costs. Nevada has already proven to be fertile ground for EV manufacturing, serving as the site of Tesla's (TSLA) Gigafactory near Reno. Neighboring Arizona, home to Lucid Motors (LCID), also demonstrates the region's capacity for high-tech automotive production.

Skilled Workforce Availability: Michigan and Ohio maintain decades of automotive manufacturing expertise. Michigan is home to major production centers for Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Rivian (RIVN). Ohio supports ongoing innovation from Honda and Lordstown Motors, providing E-Cite with access to a robust and highly skilled labor pool.

Incentives and Government Support: State and local officials across the finalist locations have extended strong business incentives, including tax credits, infrastructure enhancements, and workforce development support. These states consistently rank among the most competitive for manufacturing investment and industrial growth.

Favorable Tax Climate and Livability: Florida and Nevada both have no state income tax, making them particularly attractive for both operational costs and talent recruitment. All four states offer a lower cost of living compared to the national average, supporting long-term workforce stability and retention.

Eliminated States: California and Washington

E-Cite Motors confirmed that California and Washington were officially removed from consideration due to high operational costs, elevated taxation, burdensome regulations, restrictive labor laws, and a political climate perceived as hostile to business growth.

Although California is home to leading EV brands such as Tesla (TSLA) and several startups, its prohibitive regulatory and tax environment creates challenges for new entrants. Washington-E-Cite's current headquarters-presents similar issues, with rising costs and increasingly complex employment rules making it an unviable option for large-scale assembly operations.

""Our mission to build innovative EVs at scale demands an environment that enables-not restricts-progress,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of E-Cite Motors. ""While we respect the innovation legacy of places like California and Washington, the cost and complexity of doing business there are incompatible with our agile, forward-looking model.""

Technology-neutral tax credits for new power plants and energy storage projects will be denied if they rely heavily on Chinese equipment.","In its final form, the OBBB Act largely maintains tax credits for battery and other energy storage technologies through the next decade. This decision underscores the Trump administration’s priorities on energy security, grid resilience, and domestic manufacturing. In contrast, the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) focused more on increasing a diverse range of renewable energy technologies.

Changes to investment tax credit incentives

US energy storage projects that begin construction by the end of 2033 will still be eligible for ITC incentives. These technologies can also qualify for technology-neutral tax credits at the full rate of 30% of capex, with additional domestic content bonuses increasing the total to around 45%.

The bill amends the regulations for technology-neutral tax credits outlined in sections 45Y and 48E of the US tax code. These credits are available for power projects with zero or negative lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and battery and other energy storage projects, regardless of their emissions. They can cover between 30% and 70% of the project costs.

Projects claiming legacy tax credits under section 45 or 48 of the US tax code are unaffected by the bill. These credits can be claimed for projects that were under construction by the end of 2024. The 45Y tech neutral PTC and 48E tech-neutral ITC will be phased out by 25% beginning in 2034, until they are eliminated after 2035.

The Section 45X tax credits for manufacturers of batteries and energy storage components remain mostly intact. The Act outlines a phased reduction of these credits over three years beginning after 2029, offering a more extended support period for domestic producers of battery and storage equipment relative to other clean energy technologies.

FEOC restrictions

Arguably, the most significant developments in energy storage are the new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions. Technology-neutral tax credits for new power plants and energy storage projects will be denied if they rely heavily on Chinese equipment. Similarly, section 45X tax credits for US-made products will be withheld if they incorporate too many Chinese components.

As explained in an analysis from law firm Norton Rose Fullbright, tax credits will also be denied to companies that depend on Chinese investments or that make payments to Chinese-related counterparts through contracts and technology licences, especially when these counterparties have “effective control” over the companies, their projects, or products.

FEOC regulations will take effect for tax years after 4 July, 2025. As noted earlier, these regulations do not apply to renewable energy and storage projects claiming legacy tax credits under section 45 or 48. Starting in 2026, 55% of a project’s costs must originate from non-prohibited foreign entities, rising to 75% in and after 2030.

These calculations become more complicated when adding that a prohibited foreign entity is described as an entity with ties to China, Russia, North Korea or Iran. As explained by Norton Rose Fullbright:

“The ties can be such things as 25% or more ownership by a single Chinese shareholder or 40% by two or more such shareholders or at least 15% of total debt held by Chinese lenders, only counting debt holders at original issuance.”

Additionally, payments to over 50% of Chinese-owned companies or agreements granting such firms control, including long-term licensing rights, can classify a supplier as a prohibited foreign entity. It could be argued that these definitions encourage developers to prioritise domestic content sources, since the regulations create risks for US-based developers in sourcing content produced abroad; regardless of intent, they are stringent.

The IRS has six years to challenge a tax return over material assistance. A 20% penalty applies if the taxpayer pays more than 1% less tax due to miscalculation. For corporations, penalties apply if the tax shortfall from miscalculation is at least US$10 million or more than 1%. Equipment suppliers who provide false certificates face penalties of 10% of the customer’s claimed tax reduction. The reduction must be at least 5% of the owed tax or, if less, US$100,000.

For now, if projects obtain their cells from a foreign source not designated as an FEOC, the developer will not qualify for the domestic content bonus but will still receive the ITC. While the changes bring new issues to developers in the US, many market leaders agree that having more clarity on future projects is a welcome change from recent months.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/esvolta.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 10:58:18.195306

The moves are expected to create issues for the renewable energy industry, and critics argue that they could raise power prices.

“If you’re a rational Republican senator who wants to keep the lights on [and] keep electricity affordable, these are terrible policies,” said Leah Stokes, an environmental politics professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

President Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” slashed incentives for wind and solar energy that were part of the Democrats’ 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to significantly stifle the build-out of the growing industry.

And in recent weeks, his administration has taken further actions to hamper wind and solar power.

Shortly after the bill passed, Trump directed the Treasury Department to take a strict approach in limiting which projects are eligible for the remaining tax credits.

The Interior Department also recently announced that it would subject wind and solar projects to an elevated review process — a move that was expected to slow down their approvals.

These reviews would pertain not only to wind and solar farm approvals but also include a wide range of activities such as grants and assessments of endangered species impacts.

Ben Norris, vice president of regulatory affairs with the Solar Energy Industry Association, said he expects that some of these reviews would not only delay projects on public lands but could have similar effects on projects that are on private lands.

“We are hearing about dozens, if not hundreds of projects in the aggregate that otherwise are totally sited on private lands, totally permitted by state and local authorities, but that the Interior Department seems to have found a way to put into limbo, at least for a time,” Norris told The Hill.

Meanwhile, the Interior Department said last week that it would try to block projects that take up a lot of room, which is expected to primarily hurt solar and wind projects. And, the department said last week that it would weigh “whether to stop onshore wind development on some federal lands and halting future offshore wind lease sales.”

It also moved this week to try to cancel an already approved wind project in Idaho.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday separately announced it would move to claw back funds under a $7 billion rooftop solar program.

Norris said that “without a doubt, we have concerns” about the administration’s policies. But, he also expressed some optimism about the future.

“Despite this kind of initial onslaught, we’re not aware of anything that has been canceled. There are certainly some unexpected delays, but that’s kind of part and parcel of developing big infrastructure projects,” he said when asked about the administration’s recent policies. “The fundamentals in terms of supply and demand for solar remain outstanding.”

Stokes had similar sentiments, noting the significance of the tax credits in the Democrats’ 2022 law.

“We still made two steps forward. Maybe we’re one step back. We’re still one step forward,” she said. “You can’t uninstall all the solar and batteries that went in, in the last three years.”

President Trump has long expressed disdain for renewable energy, especially wind. He said before taking office that he’d like to see no new wind energy be constructed during his tenure.

However, negotiations over the “big, beautiful bill” revealed a split within the Republican Party about how aggressively to target renewable energy incentives.

As moderate lawmakers managed to get some concessions to slow the termination of green tax credits, Trump apparently promised to go after renewable energy through the executive branch. That’s what led to last month’s directive to the Treasury Department, instructing it to restrict provisions that protect the industry “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

This week, that effort met pushback from Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and John Curtis (R-Utah), who placed holds on Trump nominees over concerns about what could fall under the Treasury Department rule.

“Until I can be certain that such rules and regulations adhere to the law and congressional intent, I intend to continue to object to the consideration of these Treasury nominees,” Grassley said in a statement in the congressional record.

Grassley and Curtis are not the only ones pushing back. Politico Pro reported this week that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo (R) wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lament that administration policies have “frozen” solar projects.

Meanwhile, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who championed major cuts to renewable incentives, said “Ignore them,” referring to Grassley and Curtis, in a social media post.

The Trump administration’s agenda has called for the general expansion of fossil fuels as well as power-hungry data centers while it has cemented hurdles for renewables.

However, Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate at BNEF, said policies that are bad for renewables don’t clear the way for other types of energy to come online to replace it, meaning power prices could rise.

“Material availability of other technologies is pretty bottlenecked right now,” Flakoll said. “There’s a lot of wind and solar and storage. It’s cheap. You can build it quickly, so I don’t know that it really clears the way for much.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Barriers_080825_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-08 10:00:31.202194

Toyota (TM), the world's largest automaker, was the latest to reveal the impact it's seeing from tariffs in its earnings on Thursday morning, with slightly over $3 billion wiped from its fiscal Q1 (June 30) operating income.

With Toyota's results in, the cumulative tariff hit from the largest automakers following the end of the June quarter stands at around $11.7 billion, per automakers' financial disclosures. Toyota had the largest exposure, followed by rivals like Volkswagen (VWAGY), GM (GM), Ford (F), Honda (HMC), and others. China's top automakers were excluded from the list as they do not operate in the US.

Automakers, including Toyota and Honda, are not only seeing imports from their home market of Japan hit with tariffs (15%). They're also dealing with higher overall auto sector tariffs of 25% impacting operations from countries like Canada and Mexico. This also goes for the Big Three — Ford, GM, and Stellantis — which have significant operations with US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) partners.

Even Tesla (TSLA), which makes all of its vehicles in the US, had a significant tariff impact from duties on auto parts like batteries for EVs.

""The cost of tariffs increased around $300 million with approximately two-thirds of that impact in automotive and less in energy. However, given the latency in manufacturing and sales, the full impacts will come through in the following quarters,"" Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the company's earnings call on July 23.

The knee-jerk reaction for automakers would be to raise prices while eventually moving toward more US production. But neither option is an easy fix to avoid tariffs.

""Investment for new assembly plants is considerable and requires a larger rationale than a one-term presidential administration,"" AutoForecast Solutions auto manufacturing expert Sam Fiorani said. ""Building a new factory requires three to five years of planning and, likely, one or two billion in investments. Even retooling an existing facility will need around half a billion dollars.""

Fiorani noted that the financial outlays for factory spending have to be weighed against the cost of paying tariffs over the next three years.

Most high-volume models, which typically have lower profit margins, like the Nissan Rogue, are already built in the US. Moving some high-volume vehicles that are built at scale in a foreign location, like the Chevrolet Equinox, may not make sense to move to the US. On the flip side, building certain low-volume, high-profit vehicles in the US wouldn't make economic sense either.

How automakers are responding

For its part, GM said it will spend $4 billion to bring more truck and SUV production to the US.

GM said it will add production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox, currently made in Mexico, to the US starting in 2027. GM will also begin making gas-powered full-size SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe and light-duty pickups like the Silverado at its plant in Orion, Mich. It will also shift EV production from that plant to the Factory Zero Michigan plant, which produces only EVs.

Honda said this week it is considering adding a third shift to its US production facilities to blunt the effect of tariffs. Though Honda didn't say which models would be affected, it had reportedly considered moving Civic sedan production from Canada to the US, which Honda denied.

Adding a third shift would enable the automaker to limit tariff exposure and avoid the cost of constructing a new factory or adding tooling for a new production line somewhere else.

But Honda isn't out of the woods either. CFRA's Garrett Nelson believes its margins will remain ""deeply negative due to unabsorbed EV transition costs and structural tariff headwinds,"" which Nelson wrote could worsen if Trump's tariff policies ramp up again.

Even Tesla is looking to onshore some of its parts production. Tesla vice president of engineering Lars Moravy said during the Q2 earnings call that Tesla's use of LFP batteries from China was a major source of tariffs, and that the company's first LFP battery factory would be coming online by the end of the year to defray some of those costs.

The other alternative to evading the margin-eating costs of tariffs would be to pass those costs to buyers.

""In the short term, automakers did carry the costs and it showed up in the second quarter financial reports,"" Fiorani said, adding that at some point, something has to give, with prices rising.

""While it will vary depending on the profit margin on luxury models versus the need to be price competitive on the lower end, consumers of all vehicles, imported or not, will find prices going up starting this fall and increasing more next year.""

Ford initially instituted an ""employee pricing for all"" campaign for most models, effectively cutting prices in the face of tariffs and likely eating into its pre-tariff inventory. That only lasted until the end of June. Ford has since moved prices higher, especially for products like the made-in-Mexico Maverick pickup.

GM, for its part, said it hasn't had to discount at all to maintain its pricing power and that it did not have any specific actions in place to hike prices. One way, however, that automakers can raise profits without hiking retail prices is by removing incentives and charging more for financing.

""We think automakers are doing everything possible to offset tariff impacts through a combination of cost cuts, pricing, and mix, but the fact is they're going to have to absorb a large percentage of the impact of tariffs,"" CFRA's Nelson said to Yahoo Finance.

Nevertheless, even if automakers are able to move production to the US, cut unprofitable products, and streamline operations and costs, it seems one thing will remain true for the foreseeable future.

""Everyone will pay more,"" Fiorani said.

Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month.
It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.
Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.

The funding, part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

The move would likely end Connecticut’s ambitious plans to provide solar to low-income and disadvantaged communities and lower their energy bills in the process, officials with the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said. Connecticut’s award under Solar for All was $62.45 million.

Under Republican President Donald J. Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American “energy dominance” in the global market.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

In anticipation of the move, Connecticut DEEP spokesman James Fowler said in an email, “If federal support is withdrawn, states like Connecticut could be forced to halt or delay shovel-ready projects that are prepared to cut costs, clean the air, and make our grid more resilient.”

Fowler added: “It would come at a time of record energy prices, rising electricity demand, and growing strain on households and infrastructure.”

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Fowler said Connecticut’s funds were fully obligated more than a year ago and DEEP had already received some funds from the award. “The award is a cornerstone of our affordability and energy justice efforts, and Connecticut is already well into the implementation process,” he said. As of Thursday evening, DEEP had not received a termination letter from EPA.

Led by DEEP, Connecticut developed a multi-department Solar For All program it calls “Project SunBridge – Connecting Communities to a Solar Future.” Its priority is to provide solar power to multi-family affordable housing that results in an energy savings of at least 20%.

The biggest funding recipient would have been the Connecticut Green Bank, which was slated to get $43.05 million to generate loans, grants and other financing products. The EPA approved the plan and budget on January 15, 2025, just days before Trump took office.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

“These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

“This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.”

Fowler indicated earlier that Connecticut would consider the same. “We will work closely with the Office of the Attorney General and the Governor’s Office to evaluate our options and determine the most appropriate next steps.”

Solar for All is part of a $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The administration has already targeted $20 million of that for claw-backs. Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”

PJM Interconnection, the nonprofit that manages the country’s largest electricity grid region, is barely known by the general public and almost never mentioned by elected officials—except when something bad happens.

Well, something bad has happened. For two years in a row, PJM’s process for ensuring the grid has sufficient power plant capacity has resulted in record high prices, which will get passed on to consumers. The results are tied to rising electricity demand for data centers and a bottleneck in approving grid connections for new projects.

Almost everything about these events is bound up in layers of complexity.

To explain what’s happening, my colleague Rambo Talabong put together some charts and I spoke with energy policy experts. Together, we aim to make this situation understandable.

PJM, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, oversees the grid and electricity markets in a territory that stretches from New Jersey to Chicago. The organization has roots in a 1920s partnership between utilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

“It’s a bunch of utilities who have come together and said, ‘We can provide more reliable, less expensive electric service to customers if we work together and have a mutual aid pact,’” said Abe Silverman, an energy research scholar at Johns Hopkins University who has a background working in utility regulation and the energy industry. “When a customer in New Jersey can buy power from a power plant in New Jersey, or a power plant in Pennsylvania or a power plant in Ohio, it’s going to be cheaper than if they were just buying from power plants from New Jersey.”

One of the ways PJM manages its system is by holding an auction in which power plant owners compete to see who will offer the lowest prices to be available to the grid at all times.

The result is a “capacity price,” which is the price set to ensure that there are enough resources to meet the region’s needs on the hottest days of summer. The price sets the level of payments to participating power plants, which is an important income source for them in addition to what they make from selling electricity.

Here are the results of the last decade of auctions, and you can see why electricity consumers are feeling the sting.

Last year, the auction produced a result so unusual that this topic, usually reserved for the business press, became general news. The new price, which took effect two months ago, was $269.92 per megawatt-day, an increase from $28.92 per megawatt-day in the previous delivery year.

The most recent auction was last month, yielding an even higher price, $329.17 per megawatt-day. This price will take effect next June.

Since a megawatt-day (which is 24 megawatt-hours) is a unit that most people don’t use or understand, it’s easier to put these results in terms of how many billions of dollars power plant owners stand to receive in aggregate. The change from two years ago is dizzying, going from a low of $2.2 billion to the most recent result of $16.1 billion.

Governors across PJM territory have voiced their displeasure. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said, “What PJM has laid out is a slap in the face.”

Why did costs go up so much? There are many reasons, but the main one is that electricity demand is soaring, largely due to the development of data centers. The upward curve in PJM’s long-term forecast is in contrast to the prior decade-plus of flat growth.

“Supply and demand,” said Daniel Lockwood, a PJM spokesman, when asked about the reasons for rising costs. “Unprecedented and continuing growth in demand from the proliferation of high-demand data centers in the region.”

Silverman from Johns Hopkins agreed that this is, by far, the leading factor.

When demand is flat, old and inefficient power plants often struggle to compete, leading plant owners to close the plants that are losing money or barely profitable. Since 2000, PJM has seen a shift as coal-fired power plants reached the end of their lives and were replaced by natural gas plants and some renewables.

The retirement of old coal plants was good for the environment, but the rapid loss of those plants has helped to intensify the supply crunch that’s now happening.

But plant retirements are only part of the picture.

One of the reasons PJM is struggling to secure enough power plant capacity is the organization’s challenges in connecting new plants to the grid.

PJM has an online queue in which owners of prospective power plants get in line to gain approval to hook up to interstate power lines. Ideally, this would be a fast process, but the queue has turned into a quagmire of long waits, meaning the grid isn’t getting some of the new power plants that would otherwise be ready.

Most of the affected projects are solar arrays, the results of a solar boom across much of PJM territory.

Some caveats: Some of the projects in the queue are highly speculative and unlikely to get built, so the numbers can be misleading. Also, some projects are held back by more than just PJM, with challenges getting local permits and other factors.

As of June, there were 63 gigawatts of projects waiting in PJM’s interconnection process that should be completed by the end of 2026, according to Lockwood, the PJM spokesman. He noted that there are 46 gigawatts of projects that have agreements to plug into the grid today, but some aren’t being built because of factors beyond PJM’s control, such as siting, permitting and financing.

Clean energy and consumer advocates have said PJM often acts as an obstacle to reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

“The power grid operator’s policy decisions too often favor outdated, expensive power plants and needlessly block low-cost clean energy resources and battery projects from connecting to the grid and bringing down prices,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois, in a statement. “This extended price spike was preventable.”

Here are some of the wait times broken down by technology.

So, how much is a household’s electricity bill rising because of all this?

I asked several of the largest utilities in PJM for specifics. Their answers had wide variations, which helps to show differences in rate structures, state regulations and other factors that affect how and when the PJM charges reach consumers.

PSEG, the largest utility in New Jersey, notified customers in February of an impending 17 percent rate increase that was largely due to the rise in PJM charges. As of June, a household using 650 kilowatt-hours per month now paid $183, which was $27 more than before.

ComEd, which serves the Chicago area, has increased its residential bills by roughly 10 percent because of the surge in PJM charges that took effect in June. A typical household, which uses 609 kilowatt-hours per month, is paying $117, which is $11 more than before.

Dominion, which is the largest utility in Virginia and also has PJM customers in North Carolina, said its customers were largely insulated from PJM costs because the company gets most of its electricity from power plants that it owns. This is different from most large utilities in PJM, which do not directly own power plants and use market-based systems to obtain electricity for customers.

The total monthly cost for PJM capacity, even after the increase, would be less than $2 per month, according to a Dominion spokesman.

Just like PJM’s capacity prices have gone up, they can come back down. But for that to happen, some of the market fundamentals will need to change. I don’t expect that to happen any time soon.

So you’re probably going to keep hearing about PJM in the context of explanations for high electricity prices.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

The Trump Administration Prepares to End ‘Solar for All’ Program: A program designed to expand access to rooftop solar may be the next federal clean energy program to face an attempt at defunding from the Trump administration, as I report for ICN. The Solar for All program had survived months of purges, so the potential cuts are especially disappointing for the people who have been setting up state and local programs that rely on the funding.

The Country’s Largest Offshore Wind Project Remains on Track: Dominion Energy says it will complete the 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project by the end of 2026 and also gave updates on how the Trump administration’s tariffs will affect the costs, as Diana DiGangi reports for Utility Dive. Due to tariffs, costs will rise by $506 million, bringing the total amount to $10.9 billion, said Bob Blue, Dominion’s president, CEO and chairman. This project is proceeding toward completion despite the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind.

EV Charging Program May Survive Trump Assault: The Trump administration has run into formidable opposition to its attempt to freeze $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging stations, as David Ferris reports for Politico. In June, a judge said the federal government had to unfreeze the program’s funding. Last month, the judge allowed a group of nonprofits to join the case as intervenors, and additional states have become part of the case, including Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, said when communities are subject to multiple sources of pollution, it makes sense to measure the cumulative effects.

The bill would allow regulators to deny projects or impose added conditions prior to approval.

In a document about the orphaned wells program, Interior says the well cleanup is “not subject to” the ESA requirements.

But the administration’s rationale for why the reviews are not required has puzzled some attorneys, who are skeptical of the legal arguments and say the move could open up litigation threats for states.

The change — which was put in place July 17 — could also indicate a broader shift in what kinds of environmental or historic reviews officials will require for federally funded grant programs. If implemented, that wider change could mean fewer environmental reviews for a range of federal initiatives.

“It’ll be interesting to see if this is a policy that we see played out on a larger scale as the administration continues to effectuate the priority of unleashing American energy,” said Stephanie Sebor, a partner at the Jenner & Block law firm who focuses on environmental topics.

As part of the bipartisan infrastructure law that passed in 2021, Congress outlined nearly $4.7 billion in grants that states could apply for to clean up abandoned wells. As part of the grant process, the Interior Department concluded that the grants were subject to standard aspects of endangered species and historic preservation reviews.

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires that federal actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed species. That “applies to all actions federal agencies fund, authorize, permit, or carry out in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control,” according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Similarly, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act states that federal activities must be reviewed for their impact on historic resources. The law refers to those activities as “undertakings,” and federal rules have defined them as projects “funded in whole or in part under the direct or indirect jurisdiction of a Federal agency,” including “those carried out with federal financial assistance.”

But the Trump administration has concluded that those reviews do not apply to the orphaned wells program and dropped them from the requirements.

In a document about the orphaned wells program, Interior says the well cleanup is “not subject to” the ESA requirements. It also says they’re not “undertakings” under the National Historic Preservation Act.

The brief explanation does not provide the administration’s legal view of the changes.

The White House referred queries to Interior, which answered questions about grant specifics but did not respond to questions from POLITICO’s E&E News about the overall reason for changes.

“States know their land and their needs best,” Tyler Hassen, who at the time was acting assistant secretary of policy, management and budget, said in a statement accompanying Interior’s July 17 announcement. “By cutting unnecessary barriers, we’re helping them clean up old wells faster, protect communities and support energy development.”

Tens of thousands of abandoned wells exist across the U.S., many of which send methane, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. There are around 120,000 documented orphaned wells nationwide, according to a 2023 release from the U.S. Geological Survey. And USGS said there could be about 1 million orphaned wells that remain undocumented.

‘Reduce red tape’

Attorneys with expertise in endangered species and historic preservation have been digesting potential arguments behind the changes.

“It is not clear on the face of the information that has been released,” said Tom Boer, a partner at the Hogan Lovells law firm who focuses on environmental and natural resource issues.

If federal authorities provide 100 percent of the funding — as is the case with the orphaned wells program — Boer said “it would be hard for me to understand” how they are not subject to the endangered species act reviews.

Sebor with Jenner & Block said Interior may have concluded that, in general, the narrow actions of plugging abandoned wells are unlikely to affect listed species.

She noted that the changes appeared narrow and that unintentional harm to endangered species carried out during well cleanups could still be subject to ESA prosecution.

“I think this is just generally reflective of the administration’s desire to reduce red tape or streamline getting these programs out, given the priority of unleashing American energy,” Sebor said.

While cleaning up abandoned wells faster may be a net benefit for the environment, Boer said, exempting grants from endangered species reviews could make contractors or others carrying out the work vulnerable to legal risks.

With no endangered species review, Interior may not supply contractors with “incidental take” permits that provide some legal protection if listed species are harmed during otherwise lawful activity, Boer said. But if a listed species is harmed during a well cleanup, someone could still sue under the ESA.

“I would be actually concerned if I were a state, because now I am out on my own to make a determination about endangered species and potentially be subject to third-party lawsuits,” Boer said.

Since the orphaned wells program began earlier this decade, officials have not been asked for or issued any incidental take permits, Interior spokesperson Elizabeth Peace said by email.

The prospect of no environmental reviews has alarmed some environmentalists. Hollin Kretzmann, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the oil and gas sector has been working with environmental reviews for a long time.

“Starting a reckless race to plug oil and gas wells at the expense of endangered species and historic sites only adds insult to injury,” he said. “A better approach is making sure these companies pay to quickly and responsibly clean up the messes they created so Americans don’t get stuck with the bill.”

Some states with large numbers of orphaned wells have applauded the changes.

In Texas, the state Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas, plugged 34 percent fewer wells over a year-long period when the federal grants it received began requiring the reviews, according to spokesperson Bryce Dubee. He criticized how reviews were handled by the Biden administration.

Interior’s decision “allows us to quickly work … to protect public safety and the environment by plugging wells without unnecessary hurdles,” Dubee said by email this week. “We have made it abundantly clear that the formula grants include administrative hurdles by the previous administration that are not specified in the [infrastructure law] that significantly delayed plugging projects.”

Texas has received nearly $105 million in federal funds to deal with orphaned wells in recent years.

Brandon Glass, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection, said by email Thursday that the state has its own processes for protecting endangered species and historical sites. The state received $101 million in federal funds between August 2022 and September 2024 for the effort and is reviewing how the new changes will affect the grants, he said.

Sara Bronin, who chaired the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation during the Biden administration and is now a law professor at George Washington University, said she imagined the conclusion that historic preservation reviews are not required may relate to how much authority the federal government has over how states spend the money.

The opportunity to claim a clean energy Federal Tax Credit has sparked a new accelerated deadline for Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg, a recently launched community-based campaign aimed at making solar energy and battery power more affordable and accessible for all.

With federal tax credits for residential solar power expiring at the end of 2025, participants in Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg are highly encouraged to sign a residential contract by Friday, Aug. 8, to give the best chance to qualify for a 30% tax credit that can help reduce the total cost of a new solar energy system. That leaves a short window to enroll to receive a free, no-obligation proposal and make a decision to purchase with a federal tax credit potentially involved.

While signing a contract after Aug. 8 reduces the likelihood of qualifying for the federal tax credit, homeowners may still be able to complete installation in time. Additionally, all participants, regardless of tax credit contract date, will continue to receive group purchase discounts through the Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg program and access to Duke PowerPair program rebates through Oct. 31, 2025.

“The Duke PowerPair program does have a capacity limit,"" said Don Moreland, President of Solar Crowdsource. ""At this time, we anticipate capacity to be available through the end of the year.”

“If you have ever considered solar, now is the time to act if a federal tax credit incentive figures significantly into your decision-making,” said Chris Berg, Senior Sales Director from Renu Energy Solutions, the firm selected for the campaign via a careful vetting process. “In addition, the campaign at its heart saves you money through bulk-purchase pricing.”

The overall no-obligation signup deadline for Solarize Charlotte-Mecklenburg remains Oct. 31. Following that, the deadline for residential contracts to be signed is Dec. 31, 2025.

Demand for lithium has surged due to its pivotal role in the manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, which fuel energy storage devices and electrification systems.

Codelco's Chairman, Máximo Pacheco, says: “Just as we have contributed to making Chile the world leader in copper production, we will now contribute to making our country a leader in the production of lithium, another mineral critical to the energy transition, which will allow us to fight the climate emergency.”

He further adds: “We will do so as partners of SQM, a Chilean company that has the scale, technical and human expertise, financial resources and sales network that we need to avoid missing the opportunities that now open themselves up to us.”

Exploring Codelco's legacy and ambitions

Founded in 1976, the National Copper Corporation of Chile, known as Codelco, stands as a global leader in copper production.

The company’s objectives encompass exploring and exploiting mineral resources and producing refined products for worldwide markets.

Though its seven mining divisions, Chuquicamata, Ministro Hales, Radomiro Tomic, Gabriela Mistral, Salvador, Andina and El Teniente, Codelco is committed to sustainability.

By 2030, it plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by adopting a clean energy matrix, recycling 65% of its industrial waste, and reducing its inland water usage by 60.

Introducing SQM's role

SQM, short for Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile, is renowned for its supply of lithium, iodine and various industrial chemicals, with its primary facilities located in the Atacama Desert.

Discussing the new initiative, Ricardo Ramos, the company's CEO, says: “The projects we are going to develop with Codelco will be extraordinarily positive for Chile, the Antofagasta Region, communities, workers and for both companies.”

Highlighting the company’s credentials, Ricardo explains: ""This partnership is proof of the confidence we inspire with our over 25 years of experience producing lithium from the Salar de Atacama and refining it at the chemical plant in Antofagasta, our operational efficiency and the business synergies.”

He further emphasises SQM’s dedication to stringent environmental standards and ongoing dialogue with the Atacameño communities to safeguard local ecosystems.

The importance of lithium in manufacturing

Possessing significant electrochemical advantages and a lightweight nature, lithium plays a crucial role in manufacturing, particularly in the production of lithium-ion batteries.

These batteries are a cornerstone of electric vehicles and vital for energy storage across various renewable energy systems.

With South America’s 'lithium triangle', home to a staggering 85% of global reserves, accounting for 29% of production and Chile acting as the second-largest producer worldwide, the importance of this crucial mineral cannot be overstated.

This makes Chile an ideal hub for advancing lithium production aimed at reducing reliance on traditional energy forms.

Codelco and SQM: a strategic lithium partnership

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy.
But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.
But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits.
Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire.","The abrupt termination of tax credits for clean energy projects is perhaps the most drastic blow that President Donald Trump has struck in his campaign against wind and solar electricity.

As states brace for the uncertainty ahead, they are scrambling to get pending projects off the ground before the tax credits expire.

“The real opportunities are making sure that the projects in the queue make their deadline,” said Washington Democratic state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, who chairs the Senate Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. “Can we speed that up? Can we make that easier for them?”

Shewmake, and leaders in other states, say they’re focused on fast-tracking permitting decisions and working with regulators to ensure projects can connect to the grid.

“Ironically, one of the impacts of the phaseout is that there’s a rush to speed up the development of some projects in the short run,” said Warren Leon, executive director of the Clean Energy States Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of state energy agencies.

The tax credits were the linchpin for countless wind and solar projects in states aiming to get a large portion of their power from renewable energy. Leaders and advocates in those states say that renewable sources remain the best way to meet their electricity needs. But the loss of the tax credits could mean that residents pay more on their utility bills.

“This will likely kill some projects,” said Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an industry-supported nonprofit that backs clean energy policy. “The financial scenario for these projects is built around tax credits that were intended to be in place until the 2030s.”

Why are farmers so concerned about solar legislation passed in Maryland this year?

But once the dust settles, many officials expect state laws and market forces to continue driving the buildout of wind and solar.

“We still need to add electricity in this state, and wind and solar are still the cheapest way to do it,” said Pete Wyckoff, deputy commissioner of energy resources with the Minnesota Department of Commerce. “It’s a blow, but it doesn’t change our energy policy, it doesn’t change what is economically the right thing to do. But it’s a big hit to our ratepayers.”

Tax credits axed

Under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed in 2022, developers received a 30% tax credit for investments in zero-emission energy projects, along with a production credit of up to 2.75 cents for every kilowatt-hour of clean electricity generated by the projects. Those tax credits were slated to extend into the 2030s.

State officials and renewable energy industry leaders say the credits have been a major driver in the nation’s rapid buildout of wind and solar, along with corresponding growth in manufacturing jobs.

But the giant domestic policy measure Trump signed on July 4 abruptly ended those tax credits. Under the new law, projects must be up and running by the end of 2027 to qualify for the credits, or start construction by July 4, 2026. Projects that begin construction after that date must be operational by the end of 2027.

Trump has falsely claimed that wind and solar are “expensive and unreliable,” and has at the same time worked to boost fossil fuel production. He has also taken aim at the fact that some renewable energy components are manufactured overseas, calling it a national security threat.

“Projects in early to mid-stage development are deeply in danger if not completely cut off,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director with Advanced Energy United, an industry group focused on energy and transportation. “This administration is finding a variety of ways to pull the rug on wind and solar.”

While there may be a short-term burst of projects before the credits expire, the landscape becomes much more uncertain after that.

“Certainly there will be some projects that are canceled, but the bigger issue is going to be new projects that don’t get started because of the unfavorable environment for them,” said Leon, of the Clean Energy States Alliance.

A slower, costlier transition

Industry leaders say it’s too early to tell just how drastically the loss of the tax credits will slow their deployment of wind and solar. But they say states remain committed to laws that mandate a transition to clean energy. And building fossil fuel power, such as natural gas plants, is still slower and more costly.

“You don’t build a natural gas plant overnight, and there are real supply chain constraints — you can’t even get the parts,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy with Advanced Energy United.

Rai and others noted that the country is seeing a surge in demand for new electricity, driven by the electrification of vehicles and buildings, as well as growth in data centers to support technologies like artificial intelligence.

“Market forces are going to continue to drive development of clean energy, the primary market force being significant demand for new electricity,” said Abele, with the North Carolina group. “It’s not going to come from natural gas, given that turbines are on back order through 2029. Solar, wind and battery storage are the quickest ways to add electrons to the grid.”

Clean energy backers said Trump’s efforts to block solar and wind undermine his “energy dominance” agenda at a time when more power is needed. Ultimately, they believe the loss of the tax credits will cause higher electricity bills.

Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit

“Just by the law of supply and demand, if you have growing demand and you don’t have growing supply to keep up with it, that’s going to lead to higher prices,” Leon said.

According to a report from Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, the loss of the tax credits could increase electricity rates 9-18% by 2035, raising household energy costs by $170 annually.

Godfrey, the industry advocate, said that wind and solar projects may be canceled once the tax credits expire. But many of those same projects may be revived as rising electricity prices make their costs more viable.

Analysts have noted that the clean energy boom brought on by the Inflation Reduction Act has largely benefited Republican-led states. But some lawmakers fear that developers will now focus their investments on Democratic states, where laws mandating a transition to renewable sources provide more market certainty.

“We’ll probably see more of the investment go towards blue states that have those sorts of mandates,” said Utah state Sen. Nate Blouin, a Democrat. “That’s a loss for states like Utah, where we were seeing good new tax revenue, and agriculture folks making supplemental income [from wind and solar projects].”

Lawmakers in states that do have mandates say they’re still committed to meeting their goals.

“When I heard that the Inflation Reduction Act was going to be repealed, I was devastated,” said Shewmake, the Washington senator. “But then I started to look at the economics of the situation, and you realize this transition is going to happen. The federal government can slow it down, but this fight isn’t lost.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 07:58:04.693532

The EPA’s plan to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding could shift US energy priorities, roll back vehicle emissions rules and reshape climate regulation.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a key legal instrument that has enabled the federal regulation of GHG emissions from vehicles and engines.

Announced at an Indiana car dealership alongside Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Governor Mike Braun, the proposal represents a sharp reversal in the country's climate and energy regulatory framework.

It marks a move away from emissions controls and toward expanded fossil fuel use in transport and industrial sectors.

If you’re concerned about start-stop technology, EV mandates, or the regulatory costs built into the price of your next vehicle, now is the time to speak up.
The Endangerment Finding has been the legal backbone for every major greenhouse gas rule in the last 16 years.
This move by the EPA could fundamentally change the future of the auto industry and the vehicles available to American drivers.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has just set off what may be the most consequential policy shift in the auto industry in over a decade. On Tuesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a proposal to rescind the controversial 2009 Endangerment Finding, a legal foundation that has been used for 16 years to justify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations impacting every car, truck, and bus sold in the U.S.

If finalized, this proposal would dismantle more than $1 trillion in regulatory mandates, including President Biden’s aggressive electric vehicle (EV) requirements, and restore consumer choice to a market long constrained by unelected bureaucrats. It would also pull the brakes on unpopular mandates like engine start-stop systems and costly EV infrastructure requirements that automakers say have driven up vehicle prices.

Why this proposal is so significant

The 2009 Endangerment Finding gave the EPA unprecedented power to regulate six greenhouse gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act. It asserted that these gases—carbon dioxide among them—posed a threat to public health and welfare, opening the door for sweeping emissions mandates on the auto industry.

Since then, the EPA has used the finding to justify a series of regulations designed to force automakers toward electric vehicles and away from gasoline-powered cars. Biden’s 2024 standards, for example, require automakers to cut tailpipe emissions in half by 2032 and predict that between 35% and 56% of all new vehicles sold will be electric within the next decade. California and 11 other states have piggybacked on these standards with even stricter rules, including outright bans on gasoline-only cars by 2035.

Critics say these mandates amount to a de facto EV requirement that Congress never approved. They also argue that the Endangerment Finding was based on flawed legal reasoning and exaggerated climate risk assumptions.

“Obama and Biden’s EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said at the announcement, which was held at an auto dealership in Indiana.

The economic impact: $1 trillion at stake

According to EPA estimates, rescinding the Endangerment Finding would roll back regulations totaling more than $1 trillion in compliance costs. Automakers have spent years reengineering vehicles to meet complex emissions targets, often passing those costs on to consumers.

The American Trucking Association estimates that Biden’s electric truck mandate alone would have “crippled the supply chain, disrupted deliveries, and raised prices for American families and businesses.” ATA President and CEO Chris Spear welcomed the EPA’s move, calling it “a critical step toward saving jobs and protecting the economy.”

Indiana Governor Mike Braun, who joined Zeldin at the event, echoed that sentiment: “We can protect our environment and support American jobs at the same time. For too long, Washington has acted as if those two goals are mutually exclusive.”

Legal foundations and next steps

The EPA argues that recent Supreme Court rulings—including West Virginia v. EPA and Loper Bright v. Raimondo—make clear that major regulatory decisions of this scale must come from Congress, not federal agencies. These decisions limit the ability of the executive branch to unilaterally impose sweeping economic mandates without explicit legislative approval.

Here’s what happens next:

Public Comment Period – The proposal is now open for public comment until September 21, 2025. Americans, automakers, environmental groups, and industry stakeholders can weigh in via regulations.gov (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194). https://www.epa.gov/dockets/oar-dockets-open-public-comment

Final Rulemaking – After reviewing comments, the EPA will finalize the rule. This process must also pass through the White House Office of Management and Budget for approval.

Legal Challenges – Environmental groups and states like California are expected to sue, arguing that rescinding the Endangerment Finding violates the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which affirmed the agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

It’s likely the issue could end up before the Supreme Court again, prolonging uncertainty for automakers and consumers.

What this means for drivers

If the proposal is finalized and withstands legal challenges, it would reshape the entire automotive landscape:

End Biden’s EV mandate – Automakers would no longer be forced to prioritize EV production at the expense of gasoline-powered vehicles.

Lower vehicle costs – With fewer costly compliance requirements, manufacturers could pass savings on to consumers.

Restore consumer choice – Drivers could decide for themselves whether they want to buy EVs, hybrids, or gasoline-powered vehicles.

Block California’s bans – The EPA could revoke California’s ability to set stricter emissions rules than federal standards, affecting 11 other states that follow California’s lead.

However, the process will take time. Automakers must plan years in advance, and the Biden administration is expected to fight every step of the way.

How to make your voice heard

The public comment period gives everyday Americans a rare chance to influence federal policy. If you’re concerned about start-stop technology, EV mandates, or the regulatory costs built into the price of your next vehicle, now is the time to speak up.

You can submit your comments directly through the Federal eRulemaking Portal by searching for Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0194. Comments must be received by September 21, 2025.

The EPA will also hold a virtual public hearing on August 19 and 20, with an additional session on August 21 if needed. Details are available on the agency’s website.

The bigger picture

This isn’t just about EVs. The Endangerment Finding has been the legal backbone for every major greenhouse gas rule in the last 16 years. Rolling it back would not only upend Biden’s climate agenda but also shift power back to Congress and the states.

Supporters of the rescission say it’s about restoring accountability. “We’re not saying environmental protection doesn’t matter,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who stood alongside Zeldin at the announcement. “We’re saying major policy decisions should be made by elected officials, not bureaucrats.”

Opponents, however, argue that eliminating these regulations would stall progress on climate change and undermine the transition to cleaner technologies. They vow to fight the proposal in court.

This move by the EPA could fundamentally change the future of the auto industry and the vehicles available to American drivers. Whether you support or oppose it, this proposal deserves your attention. Over the next 45 days, the agency is accepting feedback from the public—and your input can help determine whether these costly and controversial mandates remain in place or are rolled back for good.

You have a voice in this process. Make sure it’s heard.

Lyft confirms the acquisition of FREENOW for US$200m following regulatory clearance, marking its first expansion beyond North America and securing a foothold in nine European countries including the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy.

The move gives the US rideshare company immediate access to 180 cities across the continent where FREENOW already operates.

Both companies start linking their platforms from 7 August 2025.

Passengers travelling between regions will be prompted to download the corresponding app, either Lyft in North America or FREENOW in Europe, until full platform integration is achieved.

Trade restrictions and regulatory shifts are reshaping how original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) source critical materials for EVs.

Rare earth elements (REEs), essential for modern vehicle components, are at the centre of a growing geopolitical struggle, one that threatens the stability of EV production worldwide.

At present, China dominates both the mining and processing of REEs, accounting for 60% of total production and 90% of global processing capacity.

This dominance gives it a unique grip on a supply chain crucial to the electric vehicle sector.

In response, countries and automakers are now rethinking how they secure materials like neodymium, dysprosium, lithium and terbium, metals vital to EV traction motors and other magnetic components.

The recent trade deal between the United States and the European Union, unveiled by US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is poised to have a notable impact on the EV sector as it reshapes transatlantic economic relations.

Announced after discussions at President Trump’s golf resort in Scotland, the agreement introduces a 15% tariff on most European goods entering the US, while requiring the EU to significantly increase its investment in American energy and defence products.

These changes are rippling through multiple industries, influencing how EV manufacturers conduct business across borders.

While many view the deal as favouring US interests by creating clear economic benefits, European nations are faced with increased costs and the need to realign their trade strategies to accommodate these new tariffs.

The deal's structure is perceived by some industry leaders as imbalanced, benefiting US exporters at the expense of their European counterparts.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/91d8b29cbad67a88e9db5a5786179dce:908e235b1fa2176227ee1a2bc4acf5cd/freenow.webp.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 10:01:18.919366

Among the industry's leaders is Panasonic, with its batteries powering more than three million EVs as of December 2023.

Panasonic's strategy includes harnessing its century-long expertise to not only decarbonise transportation but also revolutionise battery manufacturing processes.

A lithium-ion leadership

Panasonic is a prominent producer of lithium-ion batteries in North America, supplying millions of EVs.

The transport sector accounts for approximately 25% of global CO₂ emissions, according to the IEA, making the transition to EVs essential for achieving global decarbonisation targets. Panasonic's battery division plays a critical role in this evolution.

""In addition to reducing emissions from Panasonic’s own operations, this ‘reduction contribution’ also advances Panasonic’s commitment to fight climate change,"" Allan Swan, CEO of Panasonic Energy of North America, tells the Panasonic website.

""The automotive battery business is the flagship of the Panasonic Group’s efforts to confront climate change issues.""

Scaling up in US electrification

Allan oversees operations at the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada and is leading the development of Panasonic’s upcoming battery facility in De Soto, Kansas, poised to be the world’s largest. Ground-breaking took place in November 2022, with production commencing in 2025.

""The shift to EVs requires training the next generation to invent, design and build the battery technology that will power our future,"" adds Allan.

""We hope to inspire the young people who will create a more vibrant and sustainable future, and we are committed to helping them achieve their goals.""

The Kansas plant will focus on manufacturing 2170 cylindrical lithium-ion batteries, favoured by automotive manufacturers for their energy density, safety and performance.

""What we do here today, will impact your tomorrow,"" Allan emphasises.

Why North America matters

The expansion into North America is aligned with market opportunities and sustainability objectives.

""In North America, the shift to EVs is expected to accelerate against the backdrop of stricter environmental regulations and consumer demand for high-performing, fun-to-drive electric vehicles,"" Allan continues.

He highlights that the US market's demand for long-distance travel makes high-capacity battery technology particularly valuable, which Panasonic views as a competitive edge.

Panasonic values the local sourcing of materials, not only for robustness but also sustainability.

Allan goes on: “North America offers local sourcing of raw materials mined and processed in a responsible manner, often using renewable energy and other sustainability best practices.”

This localisation helps reduce transport emissions, shorten supply chains and solidify regional EV infrastructure.

A net-zero vision for battery manufacturing

The production of EV batteries is associated with a substantial carbon footprint, with nearly 90% of emissions arising during material extraction, processing and logistics. Panasonic strives to address this issue directly.

""Our Kansas plant is designed to operate as a Panasonic-designated net zero facility,"" says Allan.

""We will minimise the amount of electricity needed for production and all aspects, from wiring to machinery and equipment, will support CO₂ emissions reduction.""

Panasonic plans to completely switch to local renewable energy within the next decade and is optimising its entire supply chain to lower its Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP).

Strategic partnerships for circular supply chains

Panasonic's long-term strategy involves forging alliances with companies that align with its environmental targets.

One notable collaboration is with Redwood Materials, a US-based battery recycling company.

“Our partnership with Redwood Materials began in 2019 and together we are recycling waste materials from our Nevada plant,” Allan notes.

Panasonic has secured agreements for recycled cathode materials and copper foil, crucial components in lithium-ion batteries. Other notable sourcing partnerships are with:

Sila Nanotechnologies (US): Silicon anode materials

Novonix (US): Artificial graphite with reduced CO₂ emissions

As a finance expert with experience at Bloomberg, I believe the company's future growth prospects are uncertain and may lead to a bearish outlook.

Tesla's stock has been facing significant challenges recently, with declining global deliveries and the looming expiration of US tax credits casting a bearish outlook on the company's future growth prospects. As a finance expert with experience at Bloomberg, I believe these factors may lead to a more cautious investment stance.

The global electric vehicle (EV) market has been experiencing a slowdown, with Tesla's deliveries declining over the past few quarters. According to industry reports, Tesla's global deliveries fell by 11% in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year [1]. This trend is likely to continue as the market faces headwinds from rising raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, and increasing competition from traditional automakers and new EV startups.

Moreover, the expiration of US federal tax credits for EV purchases is expected to exacerbate the situation. The tax credits, which have been a significant driver of EV adoption in the US, are set to phase out in 2025, making Tesla's vehicles less attractive to price-sensitive consumers. The company has already started to feel the impact of this change, with a significant drop in its stock price following the second-quarter earnings report [2].

Tesla's financial performance has been mixed, with revenue growth slowing down and profitability remaining volatile. The company reported revenues of $19.33 billion in the first quarter and $22.49 billion in the second quarter, marking an average increase of 14.1% per quarter. However, its net profit increased from $409 million to $1.17 billion, reflecting an average quarterly growth of 65.1%. Despite this, the company's stock price has been volatile, with a significant drop in the wake of the Q2 earnings report and the announcement of Elon Musk's new political party [3].

In light of these challenges, Tesla's future growth prospects appear uncertain. The company will need to navigate the complexities of a slowing EV market, the expiration of tax credits, and increasing competition to maintain its market position. Investors should approach Tesla's stock with caution, considering the potential risks and uncertainties that lie ahead.

Filing Fewer Lawsuits Against Polluters - The New York Times,"Maxine Joselow, Harry Stevens, www.nytimes.com, maxine-joselow, harry-stevens",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/climate/pollution-civil-cases-epa-trump.html,"The Trump administration has filed far fewer civil cases accusing companies of violating environmental rules than its predecessors, an analysis of federal data shows.
In addition, the Trump administration reached 18 settlements in civil cases against major polluters, compared with 53 settlements in the same period under Mr. Biden, the analysis found.
When Mr. Trump took office in January, the Environment and Natural Resources Division’s environmental enforcement section had around 120 attorneys, the three people said.
In addition to staffing shortages, the Environment and Natural Resources Division has seen a change in priorities under Mr. Trump.
Some Republican lawmakers have praised the Trump administration’s approach to environmental enforcement, saying Biden officials overstepped their authority.","The Trump administration has filed far fewer civil cases accusing companies of violating environmental rules than its predecessors, an analysis of federal data shows.

In the first full six months of Mr. Trump’s second term, the Justice Department filed 11 civil lawsuits against major polluters for breaking bedrock environmental laws, compared with 30 of these cases in President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s first full six months in office, according to the analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group.

In addition, the Trump administration reached 18 settlements in civil cases against major polluters, compared with 53 settlements in the same period under Mr. Biden, the analysis found. Such settlements often require companies to pay millions of dollars in penalties.

The slowdown in enforcement has let some polluters off the hook and left communities more exposed to hazardous pollution, former officials, environmental lawyers and activists say.

The government enforces environmental laws in two ways. It can bring criminal cases when it is clear that a company intended to violate the law, or it can pursue civil complaints regardless of whether a violation was intentional. Civil cases often lead to bigger reductions in pollution, since they can arise from shutdowns, malfunctions and other instances in which a company inadvertently released high concentrations of pollutants, said Ms. Duggan.

The Environmental Integrity Project’s analysis relied on a publicly available database that tracks only civil cases, known as Enforcement and Compliance History Online, or Echo.

Brigit Hirsch, the E.P.A. press secretary, rejected the idea that enforcement has slowed under Mr. Trump and said the government was pursuing more criminal cases. She shared other data, which is not public, showing that the Trump administration has opened 66 criminal cases against polluters, compared with 60 criminal cases against polluters in the first six months of the Biden administration. The New York Times could not independently verify that data.

“We’re not only putting in place policies to power the Great American Comeback, we’re holding polluters accountable,” Ms. Hirsch wrote in an email.

David Uhlmann, who led the E.P.A.’s enforcement office during the Biden administration, said the decline in civil cases “sends an unmistakable message to polluters that the environmental cop is off the beat, which leaves communities across America less protected.”

Mr. Uhlmann said the Trump administration has opened only two significant civil cases, both of which were initially investigated by the Biden administration. One accuses an oil re-refinery in East Chicago of violating its wastewater permits by discharging toxic pollutants — including cyanide and mercury — toward the nearby Grand Calumet River. The other targets cancer-causing emissions from a facility in Puerto Rico that sterilizes medical devices.

One reason for the decline in civil cases is that dozens of lawyers have left the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division, which prosecutes polluters on behalf of the E.P.A., according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation.

When Mr. Trump took office in January, the Environment and Natural Resources Division’s environmental enforcement section had around 120 attorneys, the three people said. Today, the section has around 80 attorneys after a wave of departures and reassignments. More lawyers are set to leave in the coming months after accepting the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offers.

The division “has really been hollowed out, and that is necessarily going to affect enforcement,” said Andrew Mergen, a professor at Harvard Law School who previously spent more than three decades working in that unit.

In addition to staffing shortages, the Environment and Natural Resources Division has seen a change in priorities under Mr. Trump.

In March, the division dropped a high-profile lawsuit against a chemical manufacturer accused of releasing high levels of a likely carcinogen from its plant in LaPlace, La. The Biden administration had filed the lawsuit after determining that the plant’s emissions threatened the health of a community with the highest cancer risk in the United States.

But in a news release, the Trump administration said the dismissal of the case complied with Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government. The news release said such initiatives include efforts to reduce pollution in minority neighborhoods. The population in LaPlace is predominantly Black.

In response to questions, Adam Gustafson, the acting assistant attorney general for the Environment and Natural Resources Division, said in a statement: “As we adjust to a streamlined work force, we are focusing our enforcement capacity on cases that do the most to protect the health of all Americans, while prioritizing the critical work of defending the government, securing the border and unleashing American energy.”

The decline in civil enforcement cases is only the latest in a series of rapid-fire moves by Mr. Trump to weaken or erase environmental protections.

In March, the Trump administration said it would repeal dozens of the nation’s most significant environmental regulations, including limits on pollution from car tailpipes and power plant smokestacks. That month, the E.P.A. also said it would no longer take enforcement actions that could “shut down any stage of energy production” unless there is an “imminent” threat to public health. And last week, the E.P.A. said it would rescind the landmark scientific finding that enables the government to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet.

Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, has said these moves will make it cheaper and easier for businesses to operate in the United States. He has reoriented the E.P.A.’s mission away from environmental stewardship, saying the mission would now be to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.”

If the federal inspection uncovers a minor violation of an environmental law like the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, the E.P.A. typically initiates a civil administrative case. The agency resolves these cases by negotiating a settlement directly with the company.

But if the federal inspection reveals a major violation, such as a huge chemical spill like the one caused by the 2023 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, the E.P.A. usually refers the matter to the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. Then the division typically files a civil complaint in court and helps negotiate a settlement, which becomes a binding court order once it is approved by a judge.

The Trump administration has been initiating fewer civil administrative cases than its predecessors, although the decline has not been as sharp as the plunge in civil judicial cases. The government has filed 606 civil administrative cases in Mr. Trump’s second term so far, compared with 611 in the same period under Mr. Biden and 719 in the same period in Mr. Trump’s first term.

The Justice Department has been opening fewer civil judicial cases under nearly every major environmental law. For instance, Mr. Trump’s Justice Department has filed just two civil judicial cases under the Clean Water Act compared with 10 during the same period under Mr. Biden. Fewer cases have also been filed under laws protecting drinking water and limiting air pollution and solid waste.

Some Republican lawmakers have praised the Trump administration’s approach to environmental enforcement, saying Biden officials overstepped their authority.

“The previous administration placed an outsized emphasis on penalizing regulated entities rather than working with good-faith actors in the regulated community to ensure compliance,” Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said during a confirmation hearing this month for Jeffrey Hall, Mr. Trump’s nominee to lead the E.P.A.’s enforcement office.

But environmental groups have warned that the drop in enforcement threatens the health of communities near industrial sites that face a disproportionate amount of pollution. In Louisiana, for instance, an 80-mile stretch along the Mississippi River is often called “Cancer Alley” because of the many polluting facilities there.

“Some people get offended when we say Cancer Alley, but we are in the heart of it, and we need to hold industry accountable for all of the pollution that’s going on,” said Barbara Washington, co-founder and co-executive director of Inclusive Louisiana, an advocacy group.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/08/multimedia/08CLI-EPA-enforcement-01-jbhk/08CLI-EPA-enforcement-01-jbhk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 05:58:57.786246

The truck makers now say Mr. Trump’s actions have undermined the pact and taken away California’s right to impose the regulations.

Their brewing fight with the state shows how California is struggling to impose policies to cut down emissions as the Trump administration works to reverse those efforts.

The regulation requiring the sale of cleaner diesel trucks seeks to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides, which have been linked to respiratory diseases. The other rule demands that the truck makers sell an increasing number of battery-powered trucks, which don’t emit carbon. The manufacturers say a lack of demand for zero-emissions semis makes the rule unworkable. Battery-powered trucks cost far more than those with diesel engines, and operators say the distance they can travel before they need a charge is too short.

California said it expected the truck makers to stand by the deal, struck two years ago and called the Clean Truck Partnership.

Until GM and its South Korean partner, LG Energy Solution, start producing LFP cells domestically, this agreement will stay in effect. In mid-July, GM declared that Ultium Cells, the joint venture, would convert its battery cell plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, which didn’t start producing until 2024, to produce LFP cells. The conversion is expected to commence this year, and by the end of 2027, commercial production will begin.

As the company’s most economical electric vehicle, the new Chevrolet Bolt with LFP batteries will begin rolling off the assembly line at GM’s Fairfax factory in Kansas at the end of this year and is anticipated to hit dealerships in 2026. The model, which has been hinted at but not yet made public, is the second iteration of the 2016 US bestseller. From 2016 to 2023, the first generation was sold.

From the $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV to the $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq, GM highlights that all twelve of its current electric vehicles are equipped with batteries manufactured in the United States. In keeping with GM’s initial modular battery design, which depended only on nickel-rich cells, these chemistries are nickel-based.

The automaker has changed its approach under former Tesla CEO Kurt Kelty, who joined GM in 2024 to oversee battery research. The Chevrolet Bolt, Equinox, Blazer, and Silverado EV are among the mid-range cars that will soon use LFP batteries. A June article in The Korea Economic Daily states that Samsung SDI will also adapt a portion of its Indiana joint venture with GM, which was originally only meant for nickel-rich batteries, to make room for LFP production lines.

Purchasing LFP batteries from China until US manufacturing starts will have a financial impact on the next Chevrolet Bolt. The study states that charges on imported car parts are included in the approximately 80% total tariffs currently applied to Chinese electric vehicle batteries. In fact, GM will benefit from the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit on September 30.

For us in North Carolina, that future is now in grave danger due to illegal funding cuts from the federal government.

Three years ago this month, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed by President Biden to reduce inflation, fund climate projects, and build a pathway to a more sustainable and equitable future. However, many of these programs have been abruptly cut by the Trump administration, leading to job losses and economic instability.

Just this week, The New York Times reported the Environmental Protection Agency is contemplating cancelling 7 billion dollars of grants under the Solar for All program. Over 156 million of these dollars were awarded to North Carolina grantees to help low-wealth families, renters, and rural communities access clean, affordable energy.

One year ago, I wrote of my optimism for the billions of dollars coming into North Carolina, specifically to sustain our most underserved communities. Since the launch of our website tracking these programs in January 2024, I have worked with hundreds of residents to weatherize their homes, lower their taxes while making energy efficient improvements, and take control of their electricity bills.

It is heart-wrenching to look back at the people I’ve met and think of the stories I’ve heard from folks when I know they may now no longer be able to access resources their tax dollars pay for.

A social worker in Granville County looking for emergency funds to help a resident who had been disconnected from power for over three weeks. A senior in Edgecombe County on Social Security who was scammed while trying to replace their HVAC unit. A landowner from Yancey County who was impacted by Hurricane Helene and is just trying to get on their feet.

These residents, each of whom I have directly worked with, are at risk due to program cancellations by the federal government.

Individual residents aren’t the only ones who have benefited from Congress’s decision to fund IRA programs. Businesses have seen major expansions and investments from the clean energy tax credits, which have generated $16.2 billion in new private-led investment for over 60 energy and manufacturing facilities across North Carolina. Another 7 billion dollars of private investments have already been announced for more than 100 facilities statewide.

This capital brings well-paying jobs to our state and further cements North Carolina as the number one state to do business in. Because of these cuts, we are at risk of losing over 20 billion dollars of investments and over 17,000 jobs. A majority of these opportunities are in rural communities, where folks already struggle to find good jobs to feed their families. As the number one state for rural clean energy jobs, North Carolina simply cannot afford these losses.

We as North Carolinians cannot continue to accept the illegal and cruel clawback of funds that help our neighbors keep their lights on, make our homes healthier, and support an overdue transition to clean and reliable energy.

When it was passed, the Inflation Reduction Act represented a transformative opportunity for North Carolina, promising to bolster economic stability, foster environmental sustainability, and create a more equitable energy landscape.

But even with the subsidies phasing out for many Ohio utility customers, Waggoner said that the bad business decision to keep these coal plants running has gotten even worse.","The Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group, and the Ohio Environmental Council, and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel are challenging the utilities’ decision to pass along the costs of running the old coal plants full tilt even when it was uneconomical, among other things.

Challengers in the HB 6 case argue that the PUCO rulings improperly presumed that the coal plant charges were lawful, instead of making the utilities prove it. The commission then limited challengers’ ability to show that the costs for running the plants during poor market conditions failed to meet statutory requirements, they say.

The case for the 2018 and 2019 charges also includes an argument that the commission improperly influenced an independent audit. For instance, a commission staff member asked the auditor to ​“tone down” a draft report saying that the plants’ must-run strategy was not in the best interests of ratepayers.

Beyond that, a pending regulatory case will examine the coal plants’ costs from 2021 to 2023. And a July 31 filing by the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association Energy Group and the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel has asked the public utilities to open a case to review the coal plant charges for 2024 and 2025. The commission has not yet ruled on the request.

Meanwhile, spokespeople for American Electric Power and FirstEnergy told Canary Media their Ohio utilities will no longer include the coal charge on bills after August 14.

Others still paying

Due to a 2011 agreement among OVEC’s shareholders, both plants intend to keep operating until 2040.

So while customers of Ohio’s regulated utilities will no longer have to pay for the OVEC plants, other consumers will continue to bear the costs, said Neil Waggoner, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal program in the Midwest.

Those include the more than 380,000 homes and businesses that get their electricity from Ohio’s Electric Cooperatives, whose supplier is Buckeye Power.

Buckeye has an 18% share in OVEC, the next largest after AEP’s stake of roughly 39%. Elsewhere in the Midwest, Michigan’s public service commission recently disallowed more than $2 million in expenses charged by AEP’s Indiana Michigan Power for the same OVEC plants, while a July 23 ruling requires ratepayers in Indiana to pick up those costs.

Environmental costs from the plants also continue. Since 2020, the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel estimates, the plants have spewed more than 63 million tons of carbon dioxide. The plants also emit nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate pollution that can cause health problems for those living downwind.

“That is a lot of dirty air,” Willis said, adding that ​“consumers got the bill, while the environment and public health paid the price.”

Both the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants cleared PJM’s capacity auction last month, which will pay generation facilities roughly $329 per megawatt/​day starting in June, said American Electric Power spokesperson Scott Blake, who also speaks for OVEC.

But even with the subsidies phasing out for many Ohio utility customers, Waggoner said that the bad business decision to keep these coal plants running has gotten even worse.

“These plants are really old industrial facilities,” Waggoner said. ​“They’re at the end of their lives. It’s time for these plants to be retired or replaced.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gettyimages-1810177234-1024x6821754643255.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=bl-pk2Sq,N,,2025-08-08 10:01:23.918134

To put things in perspective, Pennsylvania alone produces enough natural gas to meet the United Kingdom’s entire energy demand.
Recognizing Pennsylvania’s energy abundance and potential for growth, some of the nation’s largest investors, energy and technology companies and policymakers, including President Trump, recently converged in Pittsburgh for the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, convened by U.S.
What the summit showed us is that energy is a bipartisan rallying point in Pennsylvania, much like it was in the 2024 election.
Our overly burdensome permitting system must be modernized to support U.S. energy dominance in the long term.","From the first commercial oil well in the U.S. to the shale revolution, Pennsylvania has paved the way for American energy dominance.

Gone are the days of depending heavily on foreign oil from overseas to fuel our vehicles or imported natural gas to heat and cool our homes. America produces more energy than any other country in the world, and Pennsylvania has played a vital role in this progress.

The Keystone State is an energy-producing powerhouse — in fact, the number two producer of natural gas in the U.S., behind only Texas. To put things in perspective, Pennsylvania alone produces enough natural gas to meet the United Kingdom’s entire energy demand. Not only is natural gas production up, but carbon emissions are down.

Recognizing Pennsylvania’s energy abundance and potential for growth, some of the nation’s largest investors, energy and technology companies and policymakers, including President Trump, recently converged in Pittsburgh for the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, convened by U.S. Senator Dave McCormick and hosted by Carnegie Mellon University, where over $90 billion in investments were announced, many of them involving natural gas-fired power generation and AI data centers.

These projects that span from the Pittsburgh region all the way to the Northeast and points south have the power to transform Pennsylvania, create tens of thousands of jobs and usher in a new era of energy, manufacturing and technology dominance.

Bottom line, AI data centers are coming to the Commonwealth, and with them come new possibilities for advancing Pennsylvania’s energy leadership and economy.

Large or hyperscale data centers can require up to 500 megawatts or more of power annually, similar to a major industrial facility.

Over the next seven years, U.S. electricity demand is projected to grow 25% — that is as much electricity as Japan generates every year. Electricity for AI is a key driver of accelerating demand.

Natural gas delivers the reliable, scalable power needed to help maintain AI data centers as well as support the electric grid, and Pennsylvania has it.

Blessed with abundant natural gas reserves, world-class universities and a dedicated, skilled workforce that’s second to none, Pennsylvania is well positioned to meet the moment and seize our energy opportunity.

What the summit showed us is that energy is a bipartisan rallying point in Pennsylvania, much like it was in the 2024 election.

To keep the momentum going, the U.S. must advance permitting reform. America can’t lead on energy or compete globally without a more efficient permitting system.

Our overly burdensome permitting system must be modernized to support U.S. energy dominance in the long term. More infrastructure and pipelines are needed in high-production regions to safely and efficiently transport energy — whether it’s to processing plants or our allies overseas. America can’t “build, baby, build” without a faster, more predictable permitting process.

In the AI era and this time of rising demand for energy, we need more affordable, reliable energy and more bipartisan solutions to boost energy access and secure our future. Permitting reform is the priority to help get shovels in the ground for many of these projects.

Billions of dollars in new investment in Pennsylvania is just the beginning. Let’s embrace this generational opportunity to unlock Pennsylvania’s potential as a next generation energy leader and realize extraordinary economic growth while helping to secure a safer, brighter future for America.

“The U.S. Constitution makes certain matters the exclusive domain of federal law for good reason,” Young wrote.
Christopher Mills, a constitutional law expert and principal at Spero Law in Charleston, said the dismissal was expected.
“The dismissal of the City of Charleston’s climate lawsuit is a victory for common sense and the rule of law,” he said.
“This case was part of a coordinated, ESG-driven campaign to shake down energy companies and impose climate policy through litigation rather than legislation.","A South Carolina judge has dismissed a climate change lawsuit brought by the City of Charleston against two dozen oil and gas companies.

Judge Roger Young of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas granted the companies’ joint motion to dismiss on Wednesday, siding with the argument that climate change litigation is a federal matter – not something for state courts to decide.

“The U.S. Constitution makes certain matters the exclusive domain of federal law for good reason,” Young wrote. “If all fifty states, let alone the tens of thousands of political subdivisions therein, were permitted to apply their own laws to such federal issues as interstate and international emissions, the result would be conflicting state standards that would be impossible for energy companies to navigate – what the U.S. Supreme Court called a ‘chaotic confrontation between sovereign states.’”

Young added that the courts are not the appropriate venue for crafting climate policy.

“This Court thus joins the ‘growing chorus of state and federal courts across the United States, singing from the same hymnal, in concluding that the claims raised by [climate-change plaintiffs] are not judiciable by any state court’ and that ‘our federal structure does not allow . . . any State’s law [to address these types of climate-change] claims.’”

At a hearing in May, Charleston attorney Matt Edling argued the oil companies had misled the public about the dangers of fossil fuels.

“You saw that it could be a calamitous problem, have benefit from it economically to extraordinary disadvantage of cities like Charleston,” Edling said.

He added that the companies “made herculean efforts to convince the world that it wasn’t a problem.”

Attorneys for the oil companies responded that the city of Charleston continues to use fossil fuels and said some companies have made big investments in renewable energy.

“That theory obviously makes no sense,” Merritt Abney, an attorney for BP, said in May.

Abney called the city’s claims about consumer deception over branding efforts unfounded.

In the ruling, Young also criticized the legal scope of Charleston’s complaint.

“Under Plaintiff’s theory, virtually anyone could be a plaintiff – and a defendant – in what would effectively amount to a perpetual series of lawsuits that reset after every storm,” he wrote.

The decision comes after similar lawsuits were dismissed in New York City, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, and California. However, unresolved cases remain in Hawaii, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.

Legal experts praised the South Carolina court’s decision.

“The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas opinion dismissing the City of Charleston’s meritless climate change deception lawsuit represents a victory for the rule of law and the proper allocation of authority within our system of government,” Donald Kochan, executive director of the Law & Economics Center at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, said.

“It recognized that state courts have no business creating new standards for emissions when the federal Congress has reserved for itself authority to regulate in that area. And, in doing so, it stood guard against the assault on the constitutionally designed separation of powers that these cases represent when attempting to turn the courts into engineers of climate change policy,” Kochan added.

Christopher Mills, a constitutional law expert and principal at Spero Law in Charleston, said the dismissal was expected.

“Judge Young followed the clear consensus of courts across the nation, which have agreed that state tort law is not the right avenue to address the complex issue of global climate change,” Mills said. “It would be a shame if the City continued to lend its name to this meritless quest by West Coast trial lawyers to deprive Americans of vital energy resources.”

Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, also welcomed the decision.

“The dismissal of the City of Charleston’s climate lawsuit is a victory for common sense and the rule of law,” he said. “This case was part of a coordinated, ESG-driven campaign to shake down energy companies and impose climate policy through litigation rather than legislation. The judge was right to throw it out.”",,N,,2025-08-08 13:08:15.233520

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, he was in many ways delivering on a campaign promise: gutting the country’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.

The new budget law delivers deep cuts for programs like renewable energy, tree-planting, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It also includes boons for oil drilling and exploration, and increases demand for timber from national forests. White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers told Grist that its policies will “turbocharge energy production” and “deliver further relief to American families and businesses.”

But one month since its signing, the Republican megabill seems to be doing the opposite. Program administrators, energy experts, and tribal leaders across the country said there is chaos and confusion as they wait to hear the fate of IRA-funded programs worth billions of dollars.

Grist reports from four locations on how local groups are wading through the cuts and uncertainty.

Appalachia

In the days and weeks following Hurricane Helene last September, most communities across western North Carolina sat in a complete electrical blackout. Sundance Power Systems, a small solar company in the town of Weaverville, partnered with the energy nonprofit Footprint Project to restore power by deploying dozens of microgrids.

“We loaded solar panels and batteries up in the back of our ’97 Chevy, and we went around and started providing power to people who didn’t have it,” said Dave Hollister, CEO of Sundance Power Systems.

Hollister and colleagues at other clean energy companies soon noticed a trend: Areas with solar panels installed before the storm seemed to fare well in Helene’s aftermath, leading them to wonder whether the systems could not only help restore power to impacted communities, but also prepare the region for its next storm.

The IRA clean energy tax credits that made solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, and other renewable energy home modifications financially accessible are now being rolled back due to the Republican budget bill.

“Tax credits were part of the business model here in North Carolina,” Hollister said. “It’s been an important part of giving folks the ability to choose renewable energy as their preferred energy source.”

Admittedly, the IRA tax credits often disproportionately benefitted wealthy families, for whom the write-off made a bigger difference simply because their taxes were bigger to begin with. But there were additional provisions like the “direct pay” tax credit system that allowed nonprofits and governments to take on costs of clean energy installation at the community level, further bolstering solar for lower- and middle-income families. Direct Pay has not been rolled back by the Trump administration as yet. Some entities, like Mountain BizWorks, a nonprofit lender in western North Carolina, can still take advantage of that to fund new clean energy projects — but they’re watching its status closely.

“It definitely adds a bit of urgency and would encourage folks, if they’ve been thinking about pursuing some of those projects, to act now,” said Eric Burton, BizWorks director of energy and climate lending. Commercial tax credits extend through 2027 rather than 2025, but it’s still a tight timeline.

Midwest

Two years ago, Doris Martin, a retired computer scientist, completely retooled her home on the South Side of Chicago. She ditched her oil furnace, water heater, washer, dryer, and stove in favor of energy-efficient electrical appliances that take advantage of growing wind and solar power, lower air pollution in the home, and reduce the carbon dioxide her personal footprint spews into the air.

These days, it’s not unusual for neighbors to ring her doorbell and ask about the heat pump standing in her backyard. They also want to know about her utility bills, which sometimes dip as low as $12.

“It’s like I always hit the lottery,” Martin said.

Martin’s great uncle built the home in 1957, and she and her daughter moved in about 20 years ago. The house had remained relatively unchanged — it even had the original doors. With help from Elevate, a Chicago-based nonprofit tackling utility affordability issues, Martin was able to transform her home into a model of energy efficiency. But the financial incentives that made her retrofit possible — federal tax credits — are now disappearing under the Republican-backed budget bill.

The loss comes just as Chicago and the Midwest were beginning to emerge as national leaders in implementing the carbon-cutting technologies.

Midwestern homeowners were among the most active users of the now-expiring tax credits. In 2023, Wisconsin ranked sixth nationwide for the use of the home energy-efficiency tax credits available through the IRA. Michigan came in at ninth. States like Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, and Ohio all appeared in the top 20, according to data from the Internal Revenue Service.

Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate, warns that the cuts will have far-reaching impacts. Her organization helps retrofit about 50,000 homes a year in the Chicago area, relying on a mix of federal tax credits, utility programs, and philanthropic funding. Without the federal incentives, she expects fewer families will be able to afford the upgrades.

“It’s not only going to result in people having higher utility bills,” said Evans. “It’s also going to reduce the jobs that are created through all of this economic activity.”

While the federal tax credits are disappearing, Alex Amends, communications director at Rewiring America, stressed that other pathways to energy efficiency remain. His team is currently tracking approximately 4,000 active incentives across 29 states and is working on adding information for Ohio and North Carolina.

“Thankfully, thousands of programs at the state, local, and utility levels remain in place,” Amends said. “The opportunity is still here and momentum remains strong. People want the better option.”

Southeast

For years, high upfront costs and tax credit structures made it difficult for all but the wealthiest Americans to install home solar. But the Biden-era IRA opened the door to a new kind of rooftop solar program that helped lower-income households tap into the technology and save on their energy bills. Nonprofits were able to claim tax credits as a direct payment from the government, then pass that money on as savings to homeowners who couldn’t otherwise afford rooftop systems. The financial services nonprofit Capital Good Fund coupled that opportunity with a $156 million Solar for All grant — another IRA provision — to fund a suite of low- or no-cost solar-lease programs in Georgia, known as Georgia Bright.

Those plans are now complicated by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Georgia Bright is better off than some IRA-funded programs because its money was already committed last year. The Republican budget megabill only rolls back unobligated funds. “For now, everything is proceeding as normal,” said Alicia Brown, the director of Georgia Bright. “We are still submitting reimbursement requests and those are being honored.” (That is despite reports that the Environmental Protection Agency is planning to terminate Solar for All grants. As of August 5, Georgia Bright’s funding was still legally obligated, Brown said.)

But Georgia Bright promises its clients energy savings of 20 percent to 70 percent that are made possible by the IRA’s clean energy tax credits structure. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will now restrict tax credits from going to what it calls a “foreign entity of concern,” defined as “own[ing] in aggregate 40 percent” of a project. There are ongoing efforts to shift solar panel manufacturing to the U.S., but progress is slow and many components still come from overseas. Organizations like Georgia Bright are still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department on how exactly that threshold will be calculated, Brown said.

“Is it just major components? Are we also talking, like, bolts and screws and encapsulants and small things like that?” she said. “If we claim a tax credit we’re not eligible for — I mean, as a nonprofit it could put us out of business.”

The organization is moving ahead with its programs, including launching a drawing for no-cost solar installations in August, Brown said, while also “considering ways to be nimble.” That could mean reducing the number of households enrolled in Georgia Bright, or finding other ways to make up the savings.

“We’re going to keep focusing on doing the work,” said Brown. “Honestly, that’s the best thing you can do to justify a program — show that it’s doing good work for everyone in every congressional district.”

Great Lakes

Among his many roles, Robert Blake, a tribal citizen of the Red Lake Nation in Minnesota, is the executive director of the nonprofit Native Sun Community Power Development. He also owns Solar Bear, a solar-installation company based in Minneapolis. Solar Bear has built four solar projects in the Red Lake Nation, which Blake said bolstered local green energy capacity and provided job and technical training for community members. He sees this kind of work as central to Red Lake’s energy sovereignty — making power more affordable for tribal members and reducing reliance on the broader grid.

Blake had hoped that Department of Energy loan initiatives — such as the Tribal Energy Finance Program, also called the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program — would help them finance additional projects. The IRA expanded the tribal finance program’s credit subsidies and loan guarantees, allowing for more funding for energy projects in Indian Country. The law increased the credit subsidy to $75 million through September 2028, and increased the program’s loan authority from $2 billion to $20 billion. But the Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminates nearly all of these funds.

“For small players like myself, and for tribal communities that are traditionally underserved or [under]invested in, this really makes it just that much more difficult,” Blake said.

The recent cuts were merely the latest setback for a program that has struggled to gain momentum, according to Jen Lerch, a senior advisor of the program until April who has worked in tribal finance for decades. The loan program office is critical to developing energy infrastructure, Lerch said, but there’s a fundamental misunderstanding of tribes and tribal finance. “Tribes are public bodies. They are likened to states in the eyes of the law, and certainly should be in the credit market,” she said. “So to approach tribal infrastructure energy financing as though it is, let’s say, Tesla or Rivian, is a grave error.”

Tribes in other parts of the Great Lakes have also seen direct impacts from the legislation. In northern Michigan, Interlochen Public Radio reported that the budget law rescinded $20 million from the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, an environmental nonprofit, and local conservancies. This was under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Regional Conservation Partnership Program. The groups had already spent $450,000 on work to preserve agricultural land and restore streams and rivers — money they will no longer get reimbursed for from the federal government. While the Republican megabill rescinded IRA funds injected into the program, it actually increased its yearly appropriation overall, and the groups will likely apply again. The tribe is also appealing to get back the originally promised funding. Unless that happens, however, they remain in the red.

The Department of Energy didn’t provide comment for this story.

President Trump's EPA is targeting key vehicle pollution rules. What does this mean for carmakers?

ALEXA ST. JOHN

Associated Press

Published: August 8, 2025

DETROIT (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency's plan recently to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.

As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.

President Donald Trump's massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don't meet federal fuel economy standards.

Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don't meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don't rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

That is all set to go away under the new law.

Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California's ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.

It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation — which also includes ships, trains and planes — is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.

Push and pull on tailpipe and mileage rules

Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation's vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.

The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.

Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.

The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.

But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden's inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.

The fines that are going away

Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.

""With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,"" NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.

Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.

Automakers that didn't meet the standards could also instead buy credits from carmakers that did — or even surpassed them — such as Tesla. That provision earned Tesla $2.8 billion in 2024 — revenue it will no longer see.

Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it ""gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits.

The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn't be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.

Experts say without them, the law ""invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.

Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a ""stunning decision"" for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.

Carlson said backing away from future fines also ""poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.""

Where auto manufacturers go from here

It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.

EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.

""Automakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won't abandon their EV development efforts,"" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. ""But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.""

WASHINGTON – On Monday, August 4, 2025, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin completed his travel to EPA’s Region One where he visited Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine on the heels of his first stops in Massachusetts, to meet with regional staff and learn more about the environmental successes and challenges in each state.

Following Administrator Zeldin’s travel to Massachusetts, he visited the Narragansett Bay Tunnel Commission and Restored Waters Program Management in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, where he received a project overview, and toured the tunnel site which will eventually hold water for filtration before being released back into the Bay, improving water quality.

Administrator Zeldin then visited the Newport Naval Base and participated in a boat tour to learn about PFAS and PCB contamination on the base that is currently being remediated.

After, Administrator Zeldin traveled to Iroquois Compressor Plant in Milford, Connecticut. The site would be an interconnection point for the Constitution pipeline, which if permitted, would unleash American energy for New England, driving down prices and enhancing grid stability for the region.

At the Raymark Industries, Inc. Superfund Site in Stratford, Connecticut, Administrator Zeldin heard from Stratford Mayor Laura Hoydick and the site team about remediation efforts at the former manufacturing plant for automotive breaks, clutch parts, and other friction components. The site is a success story for the area, with EPA helping to oversee remediation of soil, sediment, surface water and groundwater that consisted of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), asbestos, lead, copper, and about a dozen other chemical compounds.

Administrator Zeldin then met with Collective Oyster Recycling & Restoration (CORR) at their Oyster Shell Recycling site in East Haven, Connecticut, where he learned about CORR’s partnerships with local businesses and partners to recycle oyster shells that would otherwise end up in landfills to aid in shellfish restoration projects and help improve local water quality in the Long Island Sound.

Administrator Zeldin continued to the GE Consolidation Site on the Housatonic River in Lee, Massachusetts, to hear from project representatives on the final steps to needed to complete cleanup efforts and ensure clean air, land and water for residents in the area.

In Vermont, Administrator Zeldin met with Governor Phil Scott, Vermont Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts, Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore, Lieutenant Governor John Rogers, and local farmers at Newmont Farms in Bradford, Vermont. He toured the dairy farm and participated in a roundtable to hear directly from local leaders and farmers on the environmental issues that impact them most and the role of cooperative federalism in advancing commonsense policies on Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS), Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELG), Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO), National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and more.

At Eversource in Manchester, New Hampshire, Administrator Zeldin participated in a roundtable with Governor Kelly Ayotte, Mayor Jay Ruais, Commissioner for the Department of Environmental Services Robert Scott, and Eversource employees to discuss energy infrastructure and the importance of grid reliability as demand continues to increase. After the roundtable, Administrator Zeldin toured the facility control rooms. He then visited a city- owned PFAS Drinking Water Treatment in Newington New Hampshire to learn how PFAS is being eliminated from local drinking water.

Administrator Zeldin finished his New England visit in Portland, Maine, at Thompson’s Point Brownfield Site.

It's the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.

The funding, part of Democratic President Joe Biden’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens.

Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending bill signed last month by Republican President Donald Trump. The law eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund that was approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The fund set aside $20 billion in “green bank” money for community development projects to boost renewable energy, and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to slash electric bills for working families, called Zeldin’s action illegal.

“Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong — it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.”

The Trump administration has already targeted the “green bank” funds, first freezing the grants, then terminating the agreements altogether. Zeldin called them “a clear cut case of waste and abuse” and a “gold bar” scheme earlier this year.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy bill law repealed the green bank and allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree. They say the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and isn’t affected by the law.

Grant recipients have filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”

“Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding,” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American “energy dominance in the global market.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal.

“Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong — it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.”

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

“These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

“This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Grant recipients have filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”

“Trump is, yet again, putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.

The act reshapes timelines, eligibility, and other key compliance considerations regarding the federal tax credit opportunities available within the renewable energy industry.

While the final bill contained more favorable renewable energy tax provisions compared to earlier versions of the bill, there will be significant impacts to domestic and foreign investment, given new restrictions and construction deadlines. Most notably, tax credits currently available for wind and solar generation projects were predominantly scaled back, while other asset types such as fuel cells, advanced nuclear facilities, and geothermal projects gained some additional opportunities for federal credits under the OBBBA. For the renewable energy sector, the OBBBA significantly redefines federal tax credit opportunities, which means tax and accounting leaders must understand these changes to adapt their planning and forecasts immediately. In addition, highlighted below are the status of certain existing provisions that have been the subject of discussion and potential elimination, including the transferability of tax credits.

At a glance, here are the tax-related renewable energy insights accounting and tax department leaders should know:

OBBBA and Renewable Energy:

Tax Impacts of US Legislation Enacted in July 2025

Key Provision What Changed: A Quick Take Impacts and Actions Needed Wind & Solar Credits Accelerated phase-out. New projects must start construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027. Urgent: Fast-track development, update financial models, rigorously document ""beginning construction."" Foreign Entity Restrictions Limits on credits for projects with foreign ownership/control (effective 2025/2026). High Risk: Implement strong due diligence on ownership, vendors, and supply chain to avoid credit loss. Credit Transferability Preserved for eligible credits. Leverage: Continue using credit sales for liquidity/financing. Fuel Cell Eligibility Fixed 30% ITC regardless of emissions (for projects after 2025). Evaluate: Re-assess project ROI for fuel cells; greater modeling predictability. Other Clean Energy Geothermal, hydro, storage largely retain IRA timelines (to 2033). Monitor: Less urgency, but track specific guidance for these technologies. Domestic Manufacturing New incentives for metallurgical coal; wind component PTCs limited by FEOC; higher ITC for semiconductors. Optimize: Explore domestic sourcing to benefit from new/enhanced credits. Nuclear Energy New 10% community adder. Section 45U PTC maintained through 2032. Integrate: Update models with new adder; capitalize on existing PTC. Alternative Fuels Section 45Z PTC extended (to 2029); new US/Canada/Mexico feedstock rule. Adjust: Factor feedstock rules into supply chain/project viability. Other Accelerated Phase-Outs Various credits for EVs, home efficiency, and builders end by late 2025/mid-2026. Domestic content bonus now 45% minimum. Replan: Critical to reassess capital planning and tax assumptions to avoid lost value.

Accelerated Phase-out of Wind and Solar Tax Credits

The OBBBA dramatically shortens the window for wind and solar projects to qualify for Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) and Production Tax Credits (PTCs). Previously, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allowed qualifying projects to begin construction through 2032-2035, depending on the industry, and still maintain eligibility for ITCs and PTCs. The OBBBA accelerates these timelines – a wind or solar facility must now begin construction by July 4, 2026 or be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify under Section 48E and 45Y (see footnote at end of article for section descriptions). If a project meets the begin-construction deadline, it will not be subject to the 2027 placed-in-service cutoff and can still claim ITCs and PTCs under the normal continuity safe harbor (for up to four years from the start of construction). This exception effectively gives projects started by mid-2026 until late 2030 to enter service. Projects that miss this deadline will not be eligible for ITCs or PTCs. This accelerated timeline means that accounting leaders planning wind or solar installations must fast-track development or risk losing valuable credits. Projects under construction as of the end of 2024 will be largely unaffected as they remain eligible under previous rules.

Credits for Other Clean Energy Sources

In contrast, other clean energy technologies such as geothermal, hydropower, and energy storage will largely retain eligibility under the IRA's original framework. These projects can begin construction as late as 2033 for full credit, with subsequent phase down (75% credit in 2034, 50% in 2035, and 0% thereafter). Additionally, energy storage co-located with wind or solar projects is treated akin to independent technology and thus exempt from the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

The bill also eliminates ITC and PTC eligibility for small-scale renewable systems, in particular residential solar water heating and small wind energy property leased to third parties. The final version of the bill preserved eligibility for residential solar electric property under Sections 48E and 45Y.

Why this matters: The compressed construction window directly affects project timing, financial models, and capital allocation. CFOs must immediately assess project pipelines and advance start dates or risk forfeiting millions in credits that may have been previously assumed in financial forecasts.

FEOC Restrictions: Foreign Ownership and Supply Chain Risks

One of the most consequential aspects of the OBBBA is the introduction of Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) restrictions across nearly all clean energy credits. This policy is aimed at reducing reliance on foreign-controlled companies – particularly those linked to China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

Under the new FEOC regulations, it is important to be aware of the three main restrictions:

Ownership/Investment Prohibition: If a project is directly owned by a Specified Foreign Entity (SFE) or Foreign-Influenced Entity (FIE), no domestic clean energy credits can be earned. Practically, this means developers must ensure no disqualifying foreign ownership within partnership or equity structures. As FIEs are also included, companies will need to be wary of any foreign concentrations of debt, equity, or contractual influence within ownership structures. This rule is effective 2025 onward and thus requires immediate consideration.

Effective Control Rule: Beginning in 2025, even if a foreign entity isn't an owner, if an agreement grants any SFE effective control over a project or critical components of a project, credits are disallowed. The law also imposes a 10-year credit recapture for projects whereby, if, within 10 years of placing an asset in service, the company makes payments to a SFE under a contract providing effective control, 100% of the ITC could be recaptured. This recapture provision will apply to any tax year beginning in 2027.

Material Assistance: All Section 48E or 45Y eligible projects (including wind and solar projects) that begin construction after Dec. 31, 2025 will be subject to new FEOC material assistance limitations, which are applicable when the ratio of a project's costs paid to FEOCs divided by the project's total costs exceeds a designated percentage (FEOCMAT). If exceeded, the project will not be eligible for either ITCs or PTCs. Until 60 days after more detailed guidance is issued concerning the calculation of FEOCMAT, companies can rely on the domestic content guidance contained in IRS Notice 2025-08. The OBBBA may further restrict entities located in specific foreign countries from obtaining ITCs/PTCs directly or indirectly, investing in projects resulting in these credits, or contracting with the entities obtaining the credits.

Why this matters: These restrictions introduce financial and compliance risk. CFOs will need to implement diligence controls to track ownership, vendor contracts, and supply chain exposure, which may create a heavy administrative burden in the effort to prove compliance. Missteps could trigger ITC/PTC disqualification or future recapture—creating volatile tax and cash flow implications. Projects now face disqualification risk if cost thresholds are breached. Accounting and finance leaders must coordinate more closely than ever with engineering, procurement, and construction departments to ensure vendors don't inadvertently disqualify projects by exceeding FEOC-sourced cost ratios.

Executive Order Tightens Enforcement on Wind, Solar Subsidies

On July 7, 2025, the US President issued an executive order (EO) that requires certain federal agencies to produce guidance governing the enforcement of the termination of federal subsidies for wind and solar projects introduced in the OBBBA. The guidance is expected to include clarifications around how to determine when a wind or solar project has started construction, the determination of which has several implications for a project's eligibility for federal incentives. This EO explicitly instructs the Treasury Department to ""strictly enforce the termination"" of ITCs for wind and solar facilities under the OBBBA timelines. The push for more rigorous enforcement means developers may no longer rely on generous interpretations of ""beginning construction"" to secure ITCs. The EO also directs the Department of the Interior to review and revise any regulations, guidance, policies, and practices that provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities compared to traditional dispatchable energy sources (i.e., fossil fuels) within 45 days of the OBBBA's enactment.

Why this matters: With stricter IRS enforcement, finance leaders must ensure documentation of ""beginning construction"" meets evolving standards. Past assumptions about safe harbor, including the estimates of when physical work of a significant nature (PWSN) reaches the threshold for ""begin construction"" may no longer hold. Under the revised standards, minimal site work or the purchase of equipment will no longer be enough to substantiate that construction has begun, which raises risk for projects slated to qualify for credits based on loose interpretations.

Credit Transferability Preserved

Transferability of credits was originally set to be eliminated under the House's version of the bill. The final version signed into law maintains the ability for developers to sell energy tax credits for cash as introduced under the IRA.

Why this matters: This preserves a valuable liquidity mechanism. CFOs can model monetization strategies for credits that would otherwise create carryforward tax attributes and can continue to pursue cash sales or financing arrangements that recognize credit value up front.

Fuel Cells: Expanded Eligibility

Fuel cell developers received a win under the OBBBA through the removal of the requirement to determine lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Previously, only fuel cells with zero emissions were eligible to receive ITCs. Now, as long as fuel cells meet the technical specifications described in Section 48E, they will qualify for a fixed 30% ITC regardless of carbon emissions. Two caveats apply: 1) this change is effective for projects beginning construction after 2025, and 2) fuel cell projects cannot claim any of the bonus credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (e.g., the domestic content, energy community, or low-income community adders).

Why this matters: This change opens new strategic investment pathways. Finance, business, and operational teams should re-evaluate project ROI models and consider fuel cell projects post-2025 as viable credit-eligible alternatives. The fixed 30% credit also introduces modeling predictability.

Other Impacts on Clean Energy Sources

Mining & Manufacturing

The OBBBA reorients support toward domestic manufacturing and strategic materials:

Mining: The production of metallurgical coal for steelmaking will be eligible for manufacturing PTCs for tax years beginning after the enactment of the OBBBA through Dec. 31, 2029.

Energy Component Manufacturing: The OBBBA removes production tax credits for wind energy components produced and sold after Dec. 31, 2027, and production is now subject to FEOC limitations similar to those introduced for qualified facilities and energy storage technologies.

Semiconductor Manufacturing: Previously capped at 25%, semiconductor and semiconductor production equipment manufacturers will now be able to claim a Section 48D ITC of 35% for advanced manufacturing facilities placed in service after Dec. 31, 2025.

Nuclear Energy Support

It is expected that a greater push for domestic generation of nuclear power will emerge as a result of the OBBBA. The bill includes a new 10% community adder for advanced nuclear facilities based on nuclear power employment with no related unemployment requirement. The Section 45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power PTC was not modified; the credit is allowed through Dec. 31, 2032.

Alternative Fuel Incentives

For alternative fuel producers, there have been some opportunities gained – the PTC allowed under Section 45Z has been extended from 2027 through the end of 2029 and the determination of the emissions rate used to calculate the emissions factor for the PTC no longer incorporates the presumed greenhouse gas impact related to indirect land use changes. Feedstocks are now required to be sourced from the US, Canada, or Mexico. Previously, only the production of the qualifying fuel had to take place domestically, with no constraints on feedstock source. Additionally, the emissions rates can't be negative unless projects source feedstock from animal manures.

Other changes to fuel production incentives include:

The Section 40A agri-diesel PTC per-gallon increase

The extension of the 40A PTC credit through the end of 2026

The introduction of a possibility to ""double-dip"" with Section 45Z PTCs

The ability to transfer 45Z PTCs under Code Section 6418

Other Impacts on Clean Energy Tax Credits

Beyond the flagship ITC/PTC changes, the OBBBA makes numerous adjustments to other clean energy incentives, generally accelerating phase-outs or adding constraints. Below is a summary of notable changes affecting various sectors:

Electric Vehicle Credits available to consumers for both new and used electric vehicles will be cut short, terminating after Sept. 30, 2025.

EV Charging Infrastructure Credits available for commercial EV charging equipment must be placed in service by June 30, 2026 to retain eligibility.

Domestic Content Bonus Credits offered for eligible clean energy projects meeting domestic-sourcing requirements will face higher requirements, now a 45% minimum, than previously established under the IRA.

Residential and Home Efficiency Credits will be terminated early, with credits for solar panels, home batteries, and upgrades such as insulation and efficient windows ending after Dec. 31, 2025.

Builder Tax Credits available to builders for efficient new homes will expire for homes sold or leased after June 30, 2026.

Why this matters: With accelerated phase-outs and stricter eligibility requirements, accounting and finance leaders must reassess capital planning, procurement strategies, and tax assumptions to avoid stranded value and ensure projects remain financially viable under the revised incentive structure.

GreenPower Motor Company has signed a contract with the state of New Mexico to implement an all-electric school bus pilot project, the result of an award made by the state under an RFP published in May. GreenPower, a manufacturer and distributor of all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission medium and heavy-duty vehicles serving the cargo and delivery market, shuttle and transit space, and school bus sector, will deploy buses that will rotate around the state in five pilot rounds each school year, with each round lasting six weeks.

The two-year pilot project will deploy three GreenPower Type A all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission Nano BEAST Access school buses in the first school year (2025-26), and three GreenPower Type D all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission BEAST and Mega BEAST school buses in the second school year (2026-27). GreenPower will install charging systems and provide training for the drivers, mechanics, and the community’s first responders.

The contract between GreenPower and the state of New Mexico provides more than $5 million for the purchase of vehicles, the cost of charging infrastructure, and overall management of the pilot. GreenPower will support the implementation of the project from a location to be established in New Mexico. Based on voluntary requests to participate, school districts are currently being selected by the state to participate in the pilot.

GreenPower indicates that the manufacturing of the three Nano BEAST Access school buses is substantially complete, and they will be ready for deployment for Round 1 the week of September 15.

“The New Mexico pilot project provides an opportunity to expand the reach of GreenPower’s zero-emission school bus product and gives parents, kids and school districts in the state the opportunity to evaluate the transition to all-electric, purpose-built school buses,” said GreenPower president Brendan Riley. “The project is leveraging the successful pilot that GreenPower conducted in West Virginia, but also has a concentration on evaluating charging options and infrastructure.”

The pilot will include both Level 3 DC fast chargers and Level 2 slow chargers for the Nano BEAST Access school buses, and will evaluate Level 3 DC fast charging in the second year with the BEAST school buses.

A part of the second year will be a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) evaluation using the GreenPower Mega BEAST. The Mega BEAST is a 40-foot Type D all-electric, purpose-built, zero-emission school bus that delivers a class-leading range of up to 300 miles on a single charge because of its massive 387 kWh battery pack. The range of the Mega BEAST is greater than any electric school bus in its class. It has more uphill climbing power and the most compelling and cost-effective V2G capability for a more stable electric grid and community sustainability in areas where it is deployed.

“We are particularly interested in evaluating charging as a part of the pilot project,” said Mark Roper, Director of the Economic Development Division within the New Mexico Economic Development Department. “Range, charging rates and grid resiliency are critical components of switching to all-electric, zero-emission vehicles.”

GreenPower is partnering with Highland Electric Fleets to install and implement the charging infrastructure necessary for the pilot. In a letter to the state, Highland’s Chief Commercial Officer Brian Buccella shared the company’s commitment to supporting GreenPower in assessing charging infrastructure and creating a reliable EV pilot project in New Mexico. “Our experience delivering and operating electric school buses at scale positions us well to assist in the successful execution of this pilot program. This initiative presents an opportunity to reduce transportation-related emissions in New Mexico communities, protect student health and modernize school transportation,” Buccella said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Invenergy-commences-operations-at-an-Indiana-solar-farm-Recurrent-energizes-Arizonas-biggest-battery-and-more.-15.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 13:08:36.771793

Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month.
It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.
Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday terminated a $7 billion grant program intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, in the latest Trump administration move hindering the nation’s shift to cleaner energy.

The funding, part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, was awarded to 60 recipients including states, tribes and regions for investments such as rooftop solar and community solar gardens. Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power onto the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s “endangerment finding” which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

The administration has taken steps to bolster fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas as it pursues American “energy dominance in the global market.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement on social media that authority for the solar program was eliminated under the tax-and-spending law signed by Trump last month. It eliminated the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, that set aside $20 billion for community development projects to boost renewable energy and an additional $7 billion for the solar program.

“The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. “Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!”

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, who introduced the Solar for All program to cut electric bills for working families, said Zeldin’s action was illegal.

“Solar for All means lower utility bills, many thousands of good-paying jobs and real action to address the existential threat of climate change,″ Sanders said in a statement. ”At a time when working families are getting crushed by skyrocketing energy costs and the planet is literally burning, sabotaging this program isn’t just wrong — it’s absolutely insane. We will fight back to preserve this enormously important program.”

Only $53 million of the $7 billion awarded has been spent, according to a tally by the research firm Atlas Public Policy. Several grant recipients this week said their programs were in planning phases.

Stephanie Bosh, senior vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the EPA has no legal authority to terminate grants already appropriated by Congress.

“These grants are delivering billions of dollars of investment to red and blue states alike,″ she said. Bosh said solar was one of the cheapest energy sources at a time of growing demand for electricity.

“This administration is continuing to dig itself into a hole,” she said.

The EPA has argued that the tax and policy law allows the agency to rescind the money it has already obligated. The recipients of that money disagree, saying the bulk of the money had already been disbursed and is not affected by the law.

Southern Environmental Law Center litigation director Kym Meyer said if the administration wants to move forward with canceling Solar for All funds, “we will see them in court.”

Grant recipients have already challenged the administration’s actions, and a judge ruled in April the EPA cannot freeze the contracts.

Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee, called Zeldin’s elimination of the solar program a betrayal “that will further hike electricity costs and make our power grid less reliable.”

“Trump is — yet again — putting his fossil fuel megadonors first,” he added.

Cathode materials are a key component of EV batteries, directly influencing the cells’ overall capacity, energy density and safety.

This milestone marks the first time cathode materials, previously heavily reliant on China, have been manufactured entirely with Korean-sourced materials.

High-nickel, cobalt, manganese and aluminum cathode materials are known for high energy density and output. Although details on the supply volume remain undisclosed, the NCMA materials will be used in high-performance EV batteries manufactured by Ultium Cells to target the US, the world’s second-largest EV market after China.

The cathode materials, shipped on July 26, were produced using precursors from a newly completed plant in Gwangyang, South Jeolla Province, which boasts an annual capacity of 45,000 units. These precursors, made from nickel, cobalt and manganese, were then combined with lithium to create the final product. With this initial shipment, Posco Future M also plans to expand production at its Pohang plant in North Gyeongsang Province.

“While these products remain subject to the 15 percent US tariff on Korean imports, the impact can be offset by the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under the US Inflation Reduction Act,” said a source familiar with the matter on condition of anonymity.

Under the IRA, which incentivizes US production of key battery and clean energy components, EV battery manufacturers are eligible for an AMPC credit of up to $35 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells and up to $45 per kilowatt-hour for battery modules. The credit is available for production and sale through 2031, having been recently moved up by one year.

The cathodes produced by Posco Future M meet the IRA regulations that require battery components to be manufactured within the US or in a US FTA partner country such as Korea. On the other hand, battery makers using Chinese-made cathodes are ineligible for AMPC incentives, as the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act classifies China as a “Prohibited Foreign Entity.”

Posco Future M stated, “Our self-sufficient supply chain is expected to provide a significant competitive advantage over competitors, even in the face of shifting geopolitical dynamics.”

In June, Posco Future M, along with Posco Group affiliates, including Posco, Posco HY Clean Metal, Posco Pilbara Lithium Solution and Posco Lithium Solution, established a fully integrated supply chain that spans from raw materials such as lithium and nickel to precursors and cathode materials.

Meanwhile, Posco Future M is also intensifying its efforts to reduce dependence on China, particularly in the graphite supply chain. The company is developing natural graphite anode materials by securing graphite ore from non-Chinese sources, such as African countries, while promoting raw material localization through domestic production of intermediate spherical graphite.

What is the global popularity of Chinese electric cars?

Chinese-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly appearing in major cities around the world. The BBC reported on July 5, 2025, that one in ten cars sold in the UK by June 2025 was made in China. The majority of these were electric.

According to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) cited by the BBC, a total of 18,944 cars from brands owned by Chinese companies, including MG and Polestar, were sold in June 2025 in the United Kingdom. This figure represents 10 percent of the total car sales in the UK. Compared to car sales from China in the same month in 2024, this number has increased by 6 percent.

Another study from Jato Analytics shows that in the first five months of 2025, the market share of Chinese cars in the European Union (EU) was 4.3 percent. The market share of Chinese cars in Germany and France during this period was recorded at only 1.6 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. However, in Spain, Chinese cars captured a market share of up to 9.2 percent during the same period, which is higher than that of the United Kingdom (now no longer an EU member).

Globally, according to a report from the market research agency Rho Motion in the UK, on Tuesday (15/4/2025), in the first quarter of 2025, a total of 4.1 million electric vehicles were sold, representing a 29 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.

Of the total sales, Chinese cars accounted for the largest contribution with 2.4 million units sold. This sales figure represents a 36 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, European cars contributed only 0.9 million units, North America 0.5 million units, and other regions of the world 0.3 million units.

Chinese automotive companies are also targeting the electric car market in several countries in the Arab and African regions.

How popular are Chinese electric cars in Indonesia?

In the past four to five years, electric vehicles have become increasingly accepted in Indonesia. During the period of 2021-2022, sales of electric vehicles from Hyundai (a South Korean brand) experienced nearly quadruple growth. Recently, electric vehicles from China, specifically Wuling, have emerged as competitors.

In its first year of presence in Indonesia, Wuling's electric vehicle sales immediately surpassed 8,000 units. At that time, Wuling offered the Air EV electric car series at a lower price compared to Hyundai's electric vehicles. Following Wuling, a series of other Chinese cars emerged under various brands, such as BYD, Denza, Chery, Aion, and Geely.

Nowadays, we can easily find Chinese electric cars on the roads alongside Japanese and South Korean cars.

Based on data from the Indonesian Automotive Industry Association (Gaikindo), the overall sales of electric vehicles continue to rise. In 2022, the number of electric vehicles sold reached 10,327 units. In 2023, sales increased to 17,051 units, and in 2024, it rose again to 43,188 units.

This year, during the period from January to April 2025, a total of 23,952 electric cars have been sold in Indonesia. The BYD brand electric car has become the best-selling model, with sales reaching 9,214 units (approximately 35 percent), followed by Denza with 3,335 units, Wuling with 3,687 units, Chery with 3,441 units, Aion with 1,563 units, and Geely with 666 units.

Why are cheap and small electric cars popular with the urban middle class?

Electric vehicle sales in Indonesia are dominated by cars priced between Rp 300 million and Rp 499 million. In 2024, sales of electric vehicles in this price range, which is favored by the middle class, reached 59 percent.

Most of them are Chinese-made cars. Some meet the criteria for city cars, meaning they're smaller.

At the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show (GIIAS) 2025 at the Indonesia Convention Exhibition (ICE) BSD, Tangerang Regency, Banten, Chinese electric vehicle companies once again surprised attendees by presenting compact electric cars, including the Wuling New Air EV, DFSK Seres E1, and BYD Atto 1. These vehicles are priced starting from around Rp 190 million.

Cars of this type attract the interest of urban Indonesians. In addition to their compact appearance and futuristic design, the main appeal of these cars lies in their more affordable price and efficient operation.

According to automotive observer James Luhulima, this phenomenon aligns with the needs of urban communities who wish to try electric vehicles without having to drain their wallets too deeply.

The compact electric car is also economical in daily expenses. The charging cost for usage of 50-60 kilometers per day is only around Rp 7,300. In a month, the energy cost is only about Rp 200,000. This practicality is also reflected in its electricity requirements. To charge at home, this car only needs an electricity supply of 2,200 watts.

In addition, electric vehicles still receive tax incentives from the government and are exempt from the odd-even traffic regulation in Jakarta.

To what extent can a small electric car support an urban lifestyle?

Chinese electric cars, which are compact in size, support the lifestyle needs of urban residents who are practical and have high mobility. Their small size makes it easier for drivers to maneuver through dense traffic, in narrow residential alleys, or in increasingly limited parking spaces.

Its average range of 200 km is sufficient for daily needs, from picking up and dropping off school children, going to the office, to stopping by shopping centers.

Carolina Utari (37), a housewife met at the GIIAS 2025 event on Wednesday (30/7/2025), plans to purchase a small Chinese electric car, the Wuling New Air EV or DFSK Seres E1, as the second car for her family. She intends to use the car for shopping and for picking up and dropping off her children at school.

Meanwhile, Citra (32), another enthusiast of compact electric cars, plans to purchase the Wuling New Air EV that she has been eyeing for her commute to the office.

At the GIIAS event, the booth for small electric cars from China attracted many visitors. Some of them were women. They were not only ""rojali"" (groups that rarely buy) and ""rohana"" (groups that only inquire), but also individuals who had already made the decision and prepared funds to purchase their desired small electric cars.

Besides middle-class urban women, according to automotive observer Yannes Martinus Pasaribu, affordable, small electric cars from China are popular with the younger generation (millennials and Gen Z). BEV city cars from China are equipped with various wireless features that are already connected to smartphones.

Features like these make BEV city cars relevant to the lifestyles of young urbanites. Another segment that's also interested is the urban upper class looking to save money.

What is the global popularity of Chinese electric cars?

Chinese-made battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are increasingly appearing in major cities around the world. The BBC reported on July 5, 2025, that one in ten cars sold in the UK by June 2025 was made in China. The majority of these were electric.

According to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) cited by the BBC, a total of 18,944 cars from brands owned by Chinese companies, including MG and Polestar, were sold in June 2025 in the United Kingdom. This figure represents 10 percent of the total car sales in the UK. Compared to car sales from China in the same month in 2024, this number has increased by 6 percent.

Another study from Jato Analytics shows that in the first five months of 2025, the market share of Chinese cars in the European Union (EU) was 4.3 percent. The market share of Chinese cars in Germany and France during this period was recorded at only 1.6 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. However, in Spain, Chinese cars captured a market share of up to 9.2 percent during the same period, which is higher than that of the United Kingdom (now no longer an EU member).

Globally, according to a report from the market research agency Rho Motion in the UK, on Tuesday (15/4/2025), in the first quarter of 2025, a total of 4.1 million electric vehicles were sold, representing a 29 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.

Of the total sales, Chinese cars accounted for the largest contribution with 2.4 million units sold. This sales figure represents a 36 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2024.

“The U.S. Constitution makes certain matters the exclusive domain of federal law for good reason,” Young wrote.
“States and municipalities cannot pursue climate change litigation under state laws, because such claims are precluded and preempted by federal law under clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent.
“The dismissal of the city of Charleston’s climate lawsuit is a victory for common sense and the rule of law,” he said.
“This case was part of a coordinated, ESG-driven campaign to shake down energy companies and impose climate policy through litigation rather than legislation.","(The Center Square) – A South Carolina judge has dismissed a climate change lawsuit brought by the city of Charleston against two dozen oil and gas companies.

Judge Roger Young of the Court of Common Pleas granted the companies’ joint motion to dismiss on Wednesday, siding with the argument that climate change litigation is a federal matter – not something for state courts to decide.

“The U.S. Constitution makes certain matters the exclusive domain of federal law for good reason,” Young wrote. “If all fifty states, let alone the tens of thousands of political subdivisions therein, were permitted to apply their own laws to such federal issues as interstate and international emissions, the result would be conflicting state standards that would be impossible for energy companies to navigate – what the U.S. Supreme Court called a ‘chaotic confrontation between sovereign states.’”

Young added that the courts are not the appropriate venue for crafting climate policy.

At a hearing in May, Charleston attorney Matt Edling argued the oil companies had misled the public about the dangers of fossil fuels.

“You saw that it could be a calamitous problem, have benefit from it economically to extraordinary disadvantage of cities like Charleston,” Edling said.

He added that the companies “made herculean efforts to convince the world that it wasn’t a problem.”

Attorneys for the oil companies responded that the city of Charleston continues to use fossil fuels and said some companies have made big investments in renewable energy.

“That theory obviously makes no sense,” Merritt Abney, an attorney for BP, said in May.

Abney called the city’s claims about consumer deception over branding efforts unfounded.

In the ruling, Young also criticized the legal scope of Charleston’s complaint.

“Under Plaintiff’s theory, virtually anyone could be a plaintiff – and a defendant – in what would effectively amount to a perpetual series of lawsuits that reset after every storm,” he wrote.

The decision comes after similar lawsuits were dismissed around the country.

“This ruling adds to a ‘growing chorus’ of climate lawsuit dismissals by federal and state courts, including in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and California,” said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher, counsel for Chevron Corporation. “States and municipalities cannot pursue climate change litigation under state laws, because such claims are precluded and preempted by federal law under clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent.

“Judge Young rejected plaintiffs’ ‘artful’ attempts to frame its claims as solely about consumer deception, holding that ‘Plaintiff cannot avoid that its claims turn on emissions.’”

Cases still remain unresolved in Hawaii, Minnesota, Portland and Oregon.

Legal experts praised the South Carolina court’s decision.

“The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas opinion dismissing the city of Charleston’s meritless climate change deception lawsuit represents a victory for the rule of law and the proper allocation of authority within our system of government,” said Donald Kochan, executive director of the Law & Economics Center at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School.

“It recognized that state courts have no business creating new standards for emissions when the federal Congress has reserved for itself authority to regulate in that area. And, in doing so, it stood guard against the assault on the constitutionally designed separation of powers that these cases represent when attempting to turn the courts into engineers of climate change policy.”

Christopher Mills, a constitutional law expert and principal at Spero Law in Charleston, said the dismissal was expected.

“Judge Young followed the clear consensus of courts across the nation, which have agreed that state tort law is not the right avenue to address the complex issue of global climate change,” Mills said. “It would be a shame if the city continued to lend its name to this meritless quest by West Coast trial lawyers to deprive Americans of vital energy resources.”

Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, also welcomed the decision.

“The dismissal of the city of Charleston’s climate lawsuit is a victory for common sense and the rule of law,” he said. “This case was part of a coordinated, ESG-driven campaign to shake down energy companies and impose climate policy through litigation rather than legislation. The judge was right to throw it out.”

The partnership between GM and Noveon began with immediate production, and the first batch of magnets was delivered last month.

This latest agreement, along with GM’s previous contracts with MP Materials Corp and E-Vac Magnetics, a unit of Germany’s Vacuumschmelze based in the US, will enable GM to source the majority of its rare-earth magnets domestically.

This contract is a significant step in setting up a reliable supply chain within the US, especially considering the recent export controls imposed by China on rare-earth magnet production as a countermeasure to US tariff threats.

Noveon is said to be the sole operational producer of sintered NdFeB rare earth magnets in the country.

It provides a vertically integrated, wholly domestic solution for the critical supply of these magnets.

The company said its EcoFlux magnets are designed for “greater resource efficiency”, incorporating the use of recycled materials.

Noveon’s magnets are integral to various critical applications, including electric vehicles (EVs).

Noveon Magnetics CEO Scott Dunn said: “We’re proud to be delivering critical rare earth magnets in support of some of America’s most iconic vehicles.

“This agreement is a testament to what American manufacturers like GM and Noveon can do to develop supply chains and partnerships right here in the US.”

GM global chief procurement officer Jeff Morrison said: “Working with domestic manufacturers like Noveon allows us to increase the resiliency of our supply chain while supporting American jobs and strengthening our industry and economic security.”

GM’s collaboration with MP Materials started in 2021, aimed at establishing a US supply chain for these magnets.

GM reported a significant decline in profits, with a $1.1bn impact in the second quarter (Q2) attributed to the repercussions of trade tariffs.

Batteries have made significant capacity contributions within Texas’ electric grid in recent years and have been credited with helping prevent summer blackouts by bolstering grid reliability.
Last year, another California-based company, Element Energy, began storing electricity using 900 second-life EV batteries within ERCOT.
Each time the firm receives a batch of EV batteries, B2U performs its own diagnostic tests, with some 5% or 6% rejected due to substandard health.
“You haven’t heard about it much to date,” Hall said about second-life EV battery use.","East of San Antonio in Bexar County, 500 electric vehicle batteries at the end of their automotive lives will soon be repurposed to provide energy storage for Texas’ electric grid, a California company, B2U Storage Solutions, announced last week.

The batteries, housed in 21 cabinets the size of shipping containers, create a second life for the technology made from critical minerals, including lithium, nickel and cobalt, for another eight years, said Freeman Hall, co-founder and CEO.

Once the site is built and in operation later this year, the batteries will charge when there is an excess of renewable energy production on the grid and the cost of power is cheap. The Texas facility will have a total capacity of 24 megawatt hours.

B2U Storage Solutions, based in Los Angeles, plans to deploy three more grid storage projects in Texas throughout the next year, totaling 100 megawatt hours across the state, the company said. Assuming the average household uses 30 kilowatt hours per day, it’s enough energy to power 3,330 homes for a day, Hall said.

The site near San Antonio will interconnect to the CPS Energy distribution system, one of the nation’s largest city-owned utility companies.

“We’re really helping to pioneer and demonstrate to the automotive industry that repurposing makes a lot of sense for a pretty healthy number of batteries before they’re truly ready for end of life and recycling,” Hall said in an interview.

Hall and Chief Operating Officer Michael Stern began building industrial-scale solar projects almost 20 years ago in the California cities of Palmdale, El Centro and Mojave, installing some 100 megawatts, or enough electricity to power more than 15,000 homes.

But soon, as more solar began connecting to the grid, their bids to utilities were undermined by a developing “duck curve”—industry shorthand for when higher penetration of renewables on the grid depresses energy prices during sunlit hours followed by a cost spike in the evening as there’s a loss of sun.

“That’s what inspired us to realize that we needed to add storage to our projects,” Hall said. “Along the way, we had an epiphany.”

In looking for battery storage options for their solar projects, the two developers realized the first wave of commercial EV batteries were beginning to wrap up their roughly 10-year automotive life. Aware of research that these batteries’ state-of-health, measuring the difference between a new battery and a used one, circled up to 80%, Hall and Stern hypothesized that they could build technology to use the battery packs as they came from the vehicle, avoiding any repurposing costs.

So the two solar developers purchased 300 Nissan Leaf batteries. The carmaker had run into a powertrain warranty issue with the world’s first mass-market EV, as the range they promised in the lease with the customer fell short.

To fix the warranty and guarantee, Nissan swapped out the battery packs and found themselves with thousands of batteries that were still useful, Hall said, just not for driving. The batteries still had thousands of cycles left in a less-demanding scenario, like stationary storage for renewable energy.

That’s when the solar developers initiated the EV pack storage technology fundamental to B2U, which currently operates three facilities using retired batteries from electric vehicles like Teslas, the Honda Clarity and Nissan Leaf in California.

B2U’s technology allows the company to buy the retired EV battery packs without having to modify them, creating large-scale storage projects for less than if they were installing new batteries.

The global electric car fleet reached almost 58 million by the end of 2024, or about 4% of all cars on the road, according to an International Energy Agency 2025 EV Report. It’s more than triple the amount of electric cars in 2021.

The batteries in electric vehicles are typically replaced once they reach around 70 to 80% of their capacity as its range begins to diminish. As more EV batteries retire throughout the coming decade, the second-life EV battery market is forecast to grow into a $4.2 billion industry by 2035, according to a December report by IDTechEx, a technology market research firm.

As the burgeoning industry in the U.S. advances, second-life battery reuse will become less expensive to operate, the report said, as new technology develops and speeds up the process. For instance, quality assurance currently can take hours to complete but the report suggests that soon technology will pare the process down to minutes. These cost savings will be especially important as loans and incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act that supported a growing domestic recycling industry expire.

The opportunities within Texas’ competitive, wholesale grid market are what led Hall and his company to consider operating outside of their California headquarters, Hall said.

As a storage power generator, B2U is able to sell power after cheaply charging it and provide ancillary services to the grid, or get paid by the grid operators to help curb frequency deviations and imbalances.

Batteries have made significant capacity contributions within Texas’ electric grid in recent years and have been credited with helping prevent summer blackouts by bolstering grid reliability. Nearly 4,000 of the 9,600 megawatts of capacity added to the grid since last summer came from energy storage, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).

The latest generation interconnection report shows that more than 700 standalone battery storage projects and more than 300 battery plus solar projects are in line to connect to ERCOT.

Last year, another California-based company, Element Energy, began storing electricity using 900 second-life EV batteries within ERCOT. The West Texas site totals 53 megawatt hours of storage capacity, making it one of the nation’s largest retired EV battery projects, according to Element.

B2U manages more than 2,000 retired batteries through its system, which coordinates the performance of the batteries, cabinet and overall power plant. The data they collect in real time allows them to monitor the temperature of the battery packs and voltage levels. The firm has another 2,000 end-of-automative life batteries at some stage of deployment, Hall said, that will soon be ready to plug into the grid.

Each time the firm receives a batch of EV batteries, B2U performs its own diagnostic tests, with some 5% or 6% rejected due to substandard health.

The testing, coupled with how they configure the batteries in their cabinets, allow the retired batteries to operate despite variance in their capacities. In laymen’s terms, if a weaker battery has charged up and reached its voltage limit, the way B2U links their battery packs ensures that the stronger batteries can keep charging until they’re full.

“That’s kind of key to solving the problem of second-life batteries,” Hall said.

Repurposed EV batteries aren’t something you hear of much in ERCOT, or in other grids across the U.S. As one of the early innovators, it’s taken B2U nearly five years to get the core technology ironed out, cost effective and ready to scale, Hall said.

He said they got their timing just right. Since they started B2U in 2019, EV car sales in North America have nearly tripled. It means a steady flow of retirement-ready batteries available for their next career stabilizing the grid and staving off early recycling of critical minerals.

“You haven’t heard about it much to date,” Hall said about second-life EV battery use. “But you will be hearing a lot more about it going forward.”

The Road Ahead The IEMI 2024 is more than a scorecard—it is a strategic dashboard for India’s EV future.","The recently released India Electric Mobility Index (IEMI) 2024, developed by NITI Aayog in collaboration with Arthur D. Little, offers a powerful lens to evaluate the progress in electric vehicle (EV) adoption and ecosystem development across the country.

This first-of-its-kind dashboard assesses how Indian states and union territories are performing across a range of parameters, from policy execution to infrastructure roll-out and private sector engagement. Here’s an in-depth look at the key findings, insights, and road ahead from the IEMI 2024 report.

Why This Index Matters

India’s transport sector contributes to nearly 12% of the country’s energy-related carbon emissions, with over 90% of these coming from road transport. With rising urban congestion and deteriorating air quality, the transition to EVs is no longer optional—it’s essential.

The India Electric Mobility Index was developed to guide and accelerate this transition. It serves several purposes:

Provides a comparative benchmarking of states’ e-mobility performance.

Identifies best practices to drive peer learning.

Encourages competition among states to scale up adoption.

Offers a data-driven policy tool for stakeholders—government and industry alike.

The Methodology: A 360-Degree View

The IEMI is based on a robust and dynamic framework that evaluates states across three core pillars:

EV Ecosystem Development – Measuring EV sales, charging infrastructure, and grid readiness.

State EV Policy Implementation – Assessing the strength and execution of EV policies.

Business and Investment Climate – Gauging private investment, startup activity, and manufacturing capacity.

These pillars break down into nine sub-pillars and 52 measurable indicators, covering everything from EV market share and battery recycling to R\&D investments and policy incentives.

Each state is scored, ranked, and classified as:

Frontrunners – Leading the way with strong ecosystems.

Performers – Showing solid progress.

Aspirants – At early stages, needing stronger push.

India’s EV Story So Far

India’s electric vehicle story has rapidly evolved over the last five years. EV penetration has increased from a modest 1.8% in 2020 to 6.3% in 2023, with over 2 million EVs sold in 2024 alone. Two-wheelers (2Ws) dominate the EV space, accounting for nearly 60% of sales, followed by three-wheelers (3Ws), especially in commercial and last-mile delivery sectors.

Several government schemes have propelled this momentum:

FAME II: Offers subsidies for e-2Ws, e-3Ws, e-buses, and charging stations.

PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cells: Encourages domestic battery manufacturing.

PM-eDRIVE: Supports electric public and commercial transport vehicles.

Yet, despite the policy push, progress is uneven. That’s where the IEMI 2024 offers valuable insight into the states that are pushing boundaries—and those falling behind.

Who’s Leading the Charge?

Among Level 1 (Mature) States, these emerged as top performers:

Maharashtra: Strongest all-rounder, with robust EV policies, manufacturing hubs, and dense charging networks.

Delhi: High 2W and 3W EV penetration, aggressive public transport electrification, and rich policy incentives.

Karnataka: Strong EV manufacturing base, thriving startup ecosystem, and grid integration planning.

Tamil Nadu: A hub for EV component exports and major recipient of FDI in EV sector.

Among Level 2 (Emerging) States, standouts include:

Haryana: Comprehensive EV policy with fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.

Punjab: Improving charging infrastructure and commercial EV adoption.

Rajasthan and Odisha: Taking early steps in infrastructure and public e-mobility.

Key Trends Across the Nation

EV Adoption

EV penetration reached 6.3% nationally.

Delhi leads with over 13% penetration in some vehicle segments.

2W and 3W dominate the adoption curve, especially for urban commuting and last-mile delivery.

Charging Infrastructure

India now has over 25,000 public EV chargers.

Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Delhi are leading in deployment.

Fast-charging infrastructure for heavy-duty and long-distance EVs is still lagging, especially in Tier 2 and 3 cities.

Battery and Supply Chain Ecosystem

Battery localization is growing, but critical material dependency (like lithium) remains a bottleneck.

PLI schemes are encouraging battery cell and pack assembly units.

India’s battery stock is expected to reach 600 GWh by 2030, creating opportunities in recycling and second-life applications.

Public Transport Electrification

EV buses and rickshaws are gaining momentum under FAME-II.

Delhi, Gujarat, and Maharashtra have committed substantial e-bus fleets.

However, operational challenges like range anxiety and charging time persist.

Investment and Innovation

India has over 700 EV-related startups, with hotspots in Bengaluru, Pune, and Hyderabad.

Total EV investments have surpassed \$10 billion.

States like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have attracted mega-investments in EV parks and battery gigafactories.

Challenges on the Road Ahead

Despite the gains, India’s e-mobility journey faces several structural and execution challenges:

Infrastructure gaps in rural and peri-urban areas.

High upfront EV costs despite falling operating costs.

Limited R\&D and skilled workforce, especially in Tier-2 cities.

Fragmented state policies with inconsistent execution timelines.

Dependency on imports for critical battery minerals and technology.

Recommendations: Accelerating India’s EV Future

To unlock the full potential of e-mobility, IEMI 2024 offers several forward-looking recommendations:

1. Strengthen Policy Continuity

Ensure long-term subsidy roadmaps.

Harmonize central and state incentives to avoid overlap or confusion.

2. Expand Charging Infrastructure

Incentivize private sector participation, especially in rural corridors.

Develop fast-charging corridors on highways and freight routes.

3. Invest in Battery Innovation and Recycling

Scale up local R\&D in alternative chemistries like sodium-ion and solid-state.

Set up formal battery reuse and recycling policies.

4. Skilling and Workforce Readiness

Launch dedicated EV skilling programs under Skill India and NSDC.

Encourage industry-academia collaboration for advanced engineering skills.

5. Foster Startup and MSME Ecosystem

Ease regulatory clearances.

Enable green finance access to early-stage startups and fleet owners.

The Road Ahead

After September 30, these federal tax credits will be history.","Thinking about going electric? There’s no better time than now — and no time to waste.

For years, federal tax credits have helped millions of Americans afford electric vehicles by reducing the sticker price by thousands. However, that era is about to come to an end. Under the budget bill signed into law on July 4, key incentives for new, used, and leased EVs will expire on September 30, 2025.

The impact of these credits has been substantial. According to the Treasury Department, analysis shows that consumers have saved more than $1 billion in upfront costs on the purchase of over 150,000 clean vehicles since January 1st.

But with the phaseout now official, the countdown is on. Buyers have only a few months left to lock in federal savings along with any state or local incentives still in effect. If you’re considering an EV, this could be your last — and best — chance to make the switch and save.

Why Going Electric is a Smart Choice

Even as federal tax credits begin to phase out, the long-term benefits of driving electric remain strong. Across the U.S., charging an EV consistently costs less than filling up a gas tank. On average, EV drivers save approximately $1,750 per year on fuel and maintenance, meaning no oil changes, fewer moving parts, and lower fueling costs, totaling roughly $21,000 in savings over a typical 15-year vehicle lifespan. Compared to gas-powered cars, EVs generally cost about half as much to maintain and repair.

And despite lingering concerns about range, today’s EVs are more than ready for everyday life. The average electric vehicle now delivers nearly 300 miles of range on a full charge — about eight times the distance most Americans drive in a day. That means fewer charging stops and more confidence behind the wheel, whether you’re commuting to work or heading out of town.

But going electric doesn’t just save money — it also supports cleaner air and better public health. With zero tailpipe emissions, EVs reduce harmful pollutants linked to asthma, heart disease, and other serious conditions. That means healthier communities, especially for children, seniors, and individuals with pre-existing health issues.

What’s Going Away — and What You Can Still Claim

With all these benefits, it’s no surprise that federal incentives have played a key role in accelerating EV adoption. But those incentives won’t be around much longer. While one federal incentive — the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit (30C) — remains in place through June 30, 2026, offering up to $1,000 toward the installation of qualified home EV charging equipment in eligible areas, the most impactful credits are set to disappear much sooner.

The New Clean Vehicle Credit (30D), which provides up to $7,500 for qualifying new electric vehicles, and the Used Clean Vehicle Credit (25E), which offers up to $4,000 for eligible pre-owned models, will both expire on September 30, 2025. To take advantage of these generous incentives, shoppers must act before the deadline.

Why Now Is The Right Time To Make The Switch

For many drivers — especially in states without robust local EV incentives — these federal credits may be the last big opportunity to lower the upfront cost of going electric. As the deadline approaches, the market is already reacting. Dealerships are rolling out limited-time offers, including lease deals as low as $179 per month, to move qualifying vehicles before the credits disappear.

Meanwhile, the used EV market is heating up. Many models are priced between $15,000 and $20,000, with meaningful tax breaks still available for eligible buyers. Whether you’re buying new, used, or leasing, acting now could mean thousands in savings before these incentives are gone for good.

Don’t Miss Out: Act Now

Whether you’re buying new, used, or planning to lease, the window to save is closing fast. After September 30, these federal tax credits will be history. With limited-time deals, rising demand, and incentives on the line, there may never be a better moment to go electric.

Act now, make the switch, and take advantage of these credits before the opportunity expires.",https://publiquemoslo.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/EV-Photo.png,N,,2025-08-08 05:58:16.898434

The decision, announced by Energy Secretary Chris Wright during a CNN appearance Tuesday night, follows the government's revocation of the Endangerment Finding, a scientific determination that underpins a host of regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions.

Asked by CNN's Kaitlan Collins why previous editions of the National Climate Assessment were no longer available online, former fracking company CEO Wright responded: ""Because we're reviewing them, and we will come out with updated reports on those and with comments on those.""

First published in 2000, the National Climate Assessment has long been viewed as a cornerstone of the US government's understanding of climate science, synthesizing input from federal agencies and hundreds of external experts.

Previous editions warned in stark terms of mounting risks to America's economy, infrastructure, and public health if greenhouse gas emissions are not curtailed. But in April, the administration moved to dismiss the hundreds of scientists working on the sixth edition.

Under the Global Change Research Act of 1990, the government is legally obligated to deliver the climate assessment to Congress and the president.

Trump's administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have pressed forward with their pro- fossil fuel agenda -- dismantling clean energy tax credits through the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" and opening more ecologically sensitive lands to drilling.

Last month's proposed revocation of the Endangerment Finding by the Environmental Protection Agency was accompanied by the release of a new climate study from the Department of Energy, authored by climate change contrarians.

The study questioned whether heat records are truly increasing and whether extreme weather is worsening.

It also misrepresented the work of cited climate scientists, according to several who spoke to AFP, and suggested that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide could be a net benefit for agriculture.

""With nationwide injunctions limited by the Supreme Court, certifying this class is the only realistic path to justice for many under-resourced groups.","Jillian Blanchard, Vice President of Climate Change & Environmental Justice at Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG), issued the following statement in reaction to today’s U.S. District Court hearing on class certification in the first-of-its kind lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), challenging the Trump administration’s unlawful termination of $3 billion in Environmental and Climate Justice (ECJ) Block Grants:

""Yesterday’s hearing marks a meaningful step forward in the fight to restore long-promised public health and environmental justice funding to communities across the country. The stakes remain incredibly high for the hundreds of communities impacted by the Trump administration's unlawful cuts. The law and facts support class certification—and the court now has the chance to affirm that all grantees deserve their day in court.

“The hearing also highlighted the weakness of the government's legal arguments. The government’s attorney claimed that because the recent reconciliation bill (H.R.1) included a provision rescinding a smaller amount of unobligated funds from the Sec. 138 block grants, this demonstrates Congress intended to terminate the entire $3Billion Environmental and Climate Justice program. However, during the arguments, the government's own attorney was forced to admit that reconciliation bills like H.R.1 have no legal authority to rescind congressionally appropriated programs and that the obligated grant funds remain on EPA’s books. This specious argument—which we're seeing the administration deploy across multiple grant cases, including Climate United v. Citibank (Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund litigation) —demonstrates the executive’s willingness to flout Congressional intent and the rule of law, even in a courtroom.

""The administration's pattern of making legally unfounded arguments to justify unconstitutional funding cuts only reinforces what frontline communities already know: this is about politics, not law. These environmental justice grants represent commitments made by Congress to address longstanding environmental and economic harms and help local organizations build safer, healthier, and more resilient communities.

""With nationwide injunctions limited by the Supreme Court, certifying this class is the only realistic path to justice for many under-resourced groups. We'll keep fighting until these communities are heard and the resources Congress lawfully awarded are restored.""

However, the remaining households for which solar-battery systems are not cost-effective are typically the ones that already face higher utility bills and frequent power outages.
Non-Economic Areas The researchers also highlighted that households in states with frequent power outages generally benefit less from solar-battery systems.
“Economic incentives, financing mechanisms and community-based deployment programs that target areas with high financial and reliability needs but low economic viability of solar-battery systems could help families that need such systems the most,” Sun added.
As Rajagopal emphasized, ongoing research and future innovations like mobile energy storage could further enhance the affordability, sustainability and resilience of energy systems.","A compelling new study from Stanford University reveals that the majority of U.S. households could significantly reduce their electricity costs and endure power outages by installing rooftop solar panels and battery storage systems. The study suggests a pressing need for families to invest in these systems before the end of the year to take advantage of federal tax credits.

According to the study, around 60% of U.S. homes could see a reduction in their electricity costs by an average of 15% with the installation of a solar-battery system, factoring in the annualized capital and operating expenses.

Impressively, this same system could enable 63% of households to withstand local or regional blackouts, meeting about half of their electricity needs on average. For these families, this would either result in savings on their electricity bills or at least prevent an increase in costs.

However, the remaining households for which solar-battery systems are not cost-effective are typically the ones that already face higher utility bills and frequent power outages.

“With electricity rates now rising in most states, shaving utility bills can help people quite a bit, but the ability to ride out local or regional blackouts is becoming very important to many families,” senior author Ram Rajagopal, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and of electrical engineering at Stanford, said in a news release. “That’s because U.S. electricity infrastructure is old and getting replaced slowly, while the extreme weather events like hurricanes and heat waves that cause blackouts are becoming more frequent, intense and longer lasting.”

Published August 1 in the journal Nature Energy, the study involved a high-resolution, nationwide assessment of over 500,000 U.S. households’ access to solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage. A policy brief on the subject was released alongside the study in the same issue of Nature Energy.

Federal Tax Credits

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, will discontinue the residential clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 at the end of this year.

Homeowners currently can deduct 30% of their investment costs in solar panels and battery packs from their federal taxes, equating to a $12,000 rebate on a $30,000 solar array and $10,000 battery system.

“The bill does affect our analysis starting next year since our calculations include the 30% federal tax credit,” added lead author Tao Sun, a postdoctoral scholar in Rajagopal’s lab, who earned his doctorate earlier this year in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, a joint department of Stanford’s School of Engineering and Doerr School of Sustainability. “However, homeowners can still access tax credits indirectly after 2025 through leasing arrangements or power purchase agreements. These indirect benefits will continue until 2027 for solar and 2033 for batteries.”

Sun calculated that the removal of this tax credit would reduce the economic viability of solar-battery systems from 60% to about 32%, though this percentage is expected to recover to 60% by 2033 as the cost of battery packs continues to decline.

Declining Utility Payments

Changing trends in state policies also play a significant role in the financial viability of residential battery storage. Many states are now lowering the compensation homeowners receive for selling excess electricity to local utilities, which historically made battery storage less financially appealing.

With lower payments for excess solar power, homeowners can now find it more beneficial to store surplus energy for personal use when the sun isn’t shining, effectively reducing costs by avoiding retail electricity rates.

Non-Economic Areas

The researchers also highlighted that households in states with frequent power outages generally benefit less from solar-battery systems. Meanwhile, those facing higher electricity bill burdens usually see only moderate savings from such installations.

Surprisingly, regions that stand to gain the most cost reductions also achieve higher levels of affordable backup power.

“The solar-battery benefits often fail to align with the areas that need them most, like in certain high-outage-risk states where only one-fourth of households can get affordable backup power from solar-battery systems,” added co-author Arun Majumdar, the dean of Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. “As weather extremes like heat waves intensify the frequency and severity of power outages, ensuring affordable, secure and sustainable backup power is increasingly critical for at-risk homes.”

Path Forward

The study’s findings underscore the need for targeted economic incentives, financing mechanisms and community-based programs to support regions with high financial and reliability needs but low economic viability for solar-battery systems.

“Economic incentives, financing mechanisms and community-based deployment programs that target areas with high financial and reliability needs but low economic viability of solar-battery systems could help families that need such systems the most,” Sun added.

Keeping the Grid Reliable in a Time of Surging Demand

As electricity demand rises sharply across the country—driven by the growth of data centers, AI, electrification, and domestic manufacturing—policymakers face a clear imperative: ensure the electric grid remains reliable, resilient, and affordable.

That’s why the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) has submitted comments supporting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s proposed repeal of the 2024 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rule for fossil fuel-fired power plants. The proposed repeal reflects a needed course correction in light of real infrastructure limitations and system reliability concerns.

📄 Read EPSA’s full comments to the EPA » Download the full filing

What Was the Rule and Why Is Repeal Needed?

The 2024 rule imposed emissions standards that would have effectively mandated the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology for existing coal and new natural gas plants. EPSA member companies are some of the earliest investors in CCS technology and development. However, CCS deployment at scale faces substantial obstacles:

A lack of nationwide CO₂ pipeline infrastructure

Slow permitting for storage wells

Legal and regulatory challenges

Community opposition in many regions

Without these critical elements in place, the rule would have forced premature retirement or reduced output from dependable power plants—just as electricity demand is projected to climb by 25% or more by 2030. That would undermine grid reliability and threaten economic and national security goals tied to industrial growth and technological leadership.

EPSA’s Position: Realism, Reliability, and Innovation

EPSA’s members provide roughly 20% of the nation’s power through a competitive mix of natural gas, wind, solar, hydropower, nuclear, battery storage, and more. Many are also actively investing in carbon capture and other low-emission technologies. But successful deployment of such solutions must be grounded in what is feasible today—and planned for responsibly.

Our filing emphasizes:

The urgent need to maintain and invest in dispatchable, reliable power resources

The importance of tailoring emissions policies to reflect regional infrastructure readiness

The role of well-functioning power markets in driving innovation and efficiency

EPSA supports a power system where all resources that can contribute to reliability and environmental progress have a place. That includes cleaner technologies, but also the firm generation needed to ensure the lights stay on during peak demand and extreme weather.

A Balanced Path Forward

The U.S. power sector has already achieved significant emissions reductions while meeting customer demand and keeping costs low. That progress has been driven in large part by competitive markets and private sector innovation—not rigid mandates.

Looking ahead, policymakers must focus on:

Maintaining reliability through a diverse mix of energy resources

Avoiding one-size-fits-all mandates not supported by infrastructure

Creating regulatory and market certainty for investment in innovative, cost-effective solutions

EPSA appreciates the EPA’s acknowledgment of the practical challenges tied to carbon capture deployment and urges continued collaboration to shape energy policy that reflects market dynamics, regional realities, and system needs.

The transaction was completed in March, 2025. The Erie County Generating Station is a 2.4 MW landfill gas power plant. This plant utilizes all of the landfill gas produced at the Erie County Landfill and turns it into renewable electricity.

How it works.

Landfill Gas is collected through vertical, perforated wells drilled into the landfill that extract the gas when a vacuum is drawn on the system. The gas is drawn to the generating station down a quarter mile pipeline where it is utilized in two caterpillar engines. The power is delivered to the local electric grid and is sold to municipalities in Ohio via the PJM transmission system. Without the plant, the landfill gas is flared.

Building a Strong Partnership with Erie County

Looking ahead, North American is investing in major plant upgrades, with a focus on improving efficiency and increasing output to better serve the region’s energy needs.

North American is excited to work collaboratively with Erie County over the long term to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship and long term supply of electricity, baseload supply of electricity in Ohio. North American is also building a 3.2MW project in Solon Ohio, which will further support Ohio’s growing energy demands and allow for operational efficiencies.

MEMORANDUM OPINION

Two federal statutes—the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and

Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know

Act of 1986 (“EPCRA”)—create a framework for federal, state, and local authorities to address

dangerous releases of toxic chemicals. To that end, section 103 of CERCLA requires that facilities

immediately notify the Environmental Protection Agency of any release of “hazardous substances”

above a certain amount. It also exempts some types of releases from that immediate reporting

requirement. Section 304 of EPCRA, in turn, requires that facilities notify state and local author-

ities whenever covered pollutants—which it refers to as “extremely hazardous substances”—are

released into the environment. EPCRA’s notification requirements are closely tied to CERCLA’s.

Two provisions require reports whenever the release is reportable under CERCLA. The third is at

issue in this case. It mandates reports for releases of extremely hazardous substances that are “not

subject to the notification requirements” under CERCLA section 103 if they “occur in a manner

which would require notification” under CERCLA.

In 2018, Congress amended CERCLA to exempt from reporting “air emissions from ani-

mal waste (including decomposing animal waste) at a farm.” Soon after, EPA issued a final rule

exempting these releases from emergency notification under EPCRA section 304. In its view,

these releases no longer “occur in a manner” that would require CERCLA reporting. Plaintiffs, a

group of environmental organizations, sued EPA to challenge that rule, arguing the agency violated

the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) and the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).

Plaintiffs say EPA misinterpreted EPCRA’s text, failed to reasonably explain its action, and

flouted its duty to consider the environmental effects of the exemption. A group of agricultural

organizations intervened as defendants. All parties move for summary judgment. For the reasons

below, the Court will deny Plaintiff’s motion, grant EPA’s and Intervenors’ motions, and enter

judgment for EPA and Intervenors.

I. Background

A. Statutory and Regulatory Background

Congress has long sought to ensure that federal, state, and local authorities can adequately

respond to releases of certain hazardous substances or pollutants that may threaten public safety

or the environment. Two statutes work together to accomplish that end: CERCLA, see

42 U.S.C.

§§ 9601

et seq., and EPCRA, see

id.

§§ 11001 et seq.

CERCLA broadly empowers federal authorities—generally the Environmental Protection

Agency—to investigate and respond to releases or threatened releases of “hazardous substances.”

Id. § 9604(a)(1). Those are defined by statute, see id. § 9601(14), and a more detailed list is set

forth in EPA’s regulations, see

40 C.F.R. § 302.4

. To facilitate EPA’s activities, Section 103 of

2

CERCLA requires persons in charge of covered facilities to “immediately notify” EPA’s National

Response Center of any release of a hazardous substance over a certain threshold set by EPA—

also known as the “reportable quantity.”

42 U.S.C. § 9603

(a);

40 C.F.R. § 302.4

. But right from

the start, Congress excluded certain forms of “releases” from that term’s statutory definition and

added other exemptions. See

Pub. L. No. 96-510, 94

Stat. 2767 (1980).

As for the excluded releases, CERCLA defines “release” as “any spilling, leaking, pump-

ing, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, or disposing” of haz-

ardous substances “into the environment.”

42 U.S.C. § 9601

(22). But the definition “excludes”

four types of releases: (A) “any release which results in exposure to persons solely within a work-

place,” (B) “emissions from engine exhaust of a motor vehicle, rolling stock, aircraft, vessel, or

pipeline pumping station engine,” (C) releases originating from a nuclear waste incident, and (D)

“the normal application of fertilizer.”

Id.

Congress also exempted from section 103(a) reporting

any release of a hazardous substance that “is a continuous release, stable in quantity and rate,”

provided those releases are reported annually and unless there is a “statistically significant in-

crease” from prior annual reports.

Id.

§ 9603(f)(2). Congress also broadly exempted “the appli-

cation of a pesticide product registered under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide

Act [“FIFRA”] . . . or the handling and storage of such a pesticide product by an agricultural pro-

ducer.” Id. § 9603(e)(1)(A). The continuous-release exemption renders inapplicable all of section

103, which also includes recordkeeping and other requirements, see id. § 9603(e)(1), yet the pes-

ticide exemption only allows covered entities to avoid section 103(a)’s reporting requirement, see

id. § 9603(f).

EPCRA, passed a few years after CERCLA, “establishe[d] a framework of state, regional,

and local agencies designed to inform the public about the presence of hazardous and toxic

3

chemicals, and to provide for emergency responses in the event of health-threatening release.”

Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t,

523 U.S. 83, 86

(1998). It set up state, local, and tribal

emergency response commissions and planning committees, see

42 U.S.C. § 11001

, and requires

facilities where reportable quantities of “extremely hazardous substances” are present to comply

with its emergency planning provision, see

id.

§ 11002(a)(2), (b). It also requires such facilities

to make available to the public, upon request, information about certain chemicals to which they

may be exposed. See id. §§ 11021(c)(2), 11022(e)(3).

Relevant here, EPCRA section 304 also imposes “emergency notification” requirements

on facilities that produce, use, or store certain “hazardous substances” under CERCLA or “ex-

tremely hazardous substances” under EPCRA, in the event of their release into the environment.

42 U.S.C. § 11004.1

Congress “expressly tied” those reporting requirements to CERCLA’s,

Waterkeeper Alliance v. EPA,

853 F.3d 527, 533

(D.C. Cir. 2017), and they mandate emergency

notification in three circumstances. Two of those circumstances—one limited to “extremely haz-

ardous substances” and another covering any other substance, including hazardous substances—

require reports whenever the “release [also] requires a notification under section 103(a) of CER-

CLA.”

42 U.S.C. §§ 11004

(a)(1), (a)(3). Thus, under EPCRA, whether or not the release is of an

extremely hazardous substance, “a release that triggers the CERCLA duty also automatically trips

the EPCRA reporting requirements.” Waterkeeper Alliance,

853 F.3d at 533

. A third circum-

stance—central to this case—requires notification “[i]f a release of an extremely hazardous

1

EPA designates “extremely hazardous substances” for EPCRA purposes, see

id.

§ 11002(a); 40 C.F.R. part 355, App. A, and that list differs from CERCLA’s list of “hazardous

substances.” Some substances appear on both lists, others on only one. See Consolidated List of

Lists, EPA (last updated October 2024), https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-

11/consolidated-list-of-lists_updated-october-2024.pdf (cross-indexing substances listed under

CERCLA, EPCRA, or both).

substance . . . occurs,” and “such release is not subject to the notification requirements under sec-

tion 103(a) of CERCLA,” but only if it “occurs in a manner which would require notification under

section 103(a) of CERCLA.”

42 U.S.C. § 11004

(a)(2)(C).2

In 1987, EPA promulgated a rule “clarify[ing]” the connection between the two statutes’

reporting exemptions. See

52 Fed. Reg. 13378

, 13381 (Apr. 22, 1987) (“1987 Rule”). Among

other things, the 1987 Rule provided that “continuous releases,” which, as noted, “are not subject

to reporting under CERCLA section 103(a),” likewise are not reportable under EPCRA section

304(a)(2) “[b]ecause such releases do not ‘occur in a manner’ which requires immediate release

reporting” under CERCLA.

Id. at 13384

.3 EPA also clarified that “[t]he application of a registered

pesticide,” which is exempt from CERCLA’s section 103(a) reporting requirement, thus is “also

exempt from release reporting under” EPCRA.

Id. at 13385

. And the four types of releases ex-

cluded from CERCLA’s “release” definition “are also excluded from release notification” under

EPCRA.

Id.

In 2008, EPA issued a rule “exempting those hazardous substance releases that are emitted

to the air from animal waste at farms” from CERCLA’s notification requirement and, with some

limitation, from EPCRA’s emergency notifications.

73 Fed. Reg. 76948

, 76950 (Dec. 18, 2008)

(“2008 Rule”). That is, all farms were exempted from reporting such releases under CERCLA

section 103, but only small farms were exempted from reporting them under EPCRA section 304.

Id.

So-called “concentrated animal feeding operations” would still need to report under section

2

Reporting is not required, however, if the release is “federally permitted” under CERCLA

or below the reportable quantity. See

42 U.S.C. § 11004

(a)(2)(A)–(B).

3

EPA clarified this exemption in 1990 by codifying the definitions of “continuous” and

“statistically significant increase.”

55 Fed. Reg. 30166

, 30179 (July 24, 1990); see

40 C.F.R.

§ 355.32

. It did so to “clarify the meaning of the statutory phrase, ‘occurs in a manner which

would require notification under CERCLA section 103(a).’” 55 Fed. Reg. at 30179.

5

304. Id. In promulgating the rule, EPA reasoned that reports about air emissions from animal

waste were “unnecessary, burdensome, and would not likely result in ‘new’ information regarding

emissions from farms,” id. at 76954, and “that a response to a notification” about such releases

was “unlikely and impracticable,” id. at 76955. Environmental groups challenged the 2008 Rule,

and the D.C. Circuit vacated it in 2017, holding that EPA lacked statutory authority to carve out

new reporting exemptions. See Waterkeeper Alliance, 853 F.3d at 534–535.

Congress responded. A year later, it passed the Fair Agricultural Reporting Method

(“FARM”) Act, which amended CERCLA section 103(a) to add a new exemption for “air emis-

sions from animal waste (including decomposing animal waste) at a farm.”

Pub. L. No. 115-141,

§§

1101–03,

132 Stat. 348

, 1147–48 (2018); see

42 U.S.C. § 9603

(e)(1)(B). Six months after the

FARM Act’s passage, EPA proposed a rule to exempt animal waste air emissions from EPCRA’s

immediate reporting requirements.

83 Fed. Reg. 56791

(Nov. 14, 2018). Because “these types of

releases no longer require notice under CERCLA section 103(a),” EPA reasoned, they did not

“meet[] the requirements of EPCRA section 304(a)(1) or 304(a)(3).”

Id. at 56792

. Nor was re-

porting required under section 304(a)(2): Congress “exempted these types of releases from CER-

CLA reporting,” so “[a]ir emissions from animal waste at farms no longer ‘occur[] in a manner’

that would require notification under CERCLA section 103(a).”

Id. at 56793

. EPA took final

action on the proposal in June 2019.

84 Fed. Reg. 27533

(June 13, 2019); see

40 C.F.R. §§ 355.31

,

355.71 (“2019 Rule”).

B. Procedural Background

Plaintiffs, a group of environmental organizations4, sued EPA in 2017, challenging

4

Specifically, Plaintiffs are Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, Ani-

mal Legal Defense Fund, Inc., Center for Food Safety, Don’t Waste Arizona, Environmental

6

guidance that the agency had issued before the proposed rule. ECF No. 1. Once EPA issued the

2019 Rule, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to challenge it too. ECF No. 29. They allege that

EPA’s guidance and final rule violate the APA because the exemption contravenes EPCRA’s

“clear statutory language,” which requires reporting of releases of “extremely hazardous sub-

stances” above certain quantities.

Id.

at 38–39, 40. Plaintiffs also allege that EPA acted arbitrarily

and capriciously by issuing “the Final Rule without recognizing that it was changing its position,”

and “without substantial evidence supporting” it.

Id. at 41

. And they alleged that EPA violated

NEPA by failing to conduct an environmental impact analysis.

Id.

at 41–42.5 A group of agricul-

tural organizations—National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, National Pork Producers Council,

American Farm Bureau Federation, and U.S. Poultry & Egg Association—intervened as defend-

ants. ECF No. 46.

In 2021, the Biden administration directed federal agencies, including EPA, to “immedi-

ately review and . . . take action to address the promulgation of Federal regulations and other ac-

tions during the last 4 years that conflict with” the President’s stated national objectives, including

the Administration’s environmental policies. ECF No. 58 at 10–11. So EPA moved for a volun-

tary remand without vacatur, which the Court allowed. ECF Nos. 58, 64. EPA issued a notice of

proposed rulemaking, “requesting comments to assist in the potential development of regulations

to reinstate the reporting of animal waste air emissions at farms” under EPCRA.

88 Fed. Reg.

80222

, 80223 (Nov. 17, 2023). But soon after, the parties moved to rescind the remand based on

Integrity Project, Food & Water Watch, Inc., Humane Society of the United States, Sierra Club,

Sound Rivers, Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc., and Center for Biological Diversity.

5

Plaintiffs also alleged that EPA’s guidance was issued in violation of the APA because it

was issued without adherence to the APA notice-and-comment procedures and without the requi-

site administrative record or reasoned analysis. ECF No. 29 at 37–38, 39–40. The Court dismissed

those claims as moot. See ECF No. 40.

7

EPA’s “represent[ation] that it [wa]s not in a position to proceed with a new rulemaking.” ECF

No. 81 at 2. Plaintiffs’, EPA’s, and Intervenors’ cross-motions for summary judgment followed.

See ECF Nos. 83, 86, 89.

II. Legal Standard

When a plaintiff “seeks review of agency action under the APA,” a court has no fact-find-

ing role; it “sits as an appellate tribunal.” Am. Bioscience, Inc. v. Thompson,

269 F.3d 1077, 1083

(D.C. Cir. 2001). So the only question is which party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is “arbitrary, capri-

cious, . . . or otherwise not in accordance with law.”

5 U.S.C. § 706

(2)(A). The court must “decide

all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the

meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo,

603 U.S. 369, 391

(2024) (citing

5 U.S.C. § 706

). So when deciding “whether an agency’s inter-

pretation of its governing statute is contrary to law,” the court “must exercise [its] ‘independent

judgment’ and ‘apply[] all relevant interpretive tools’ to reach ‘the best reading of the statute.’”

Env’t Def. Fund. v. EPA,

124 F.4th 1

, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quoting Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 394–

95, 400). And when evaluating a claim that agency action is arbitrary or capricious, the court asks

whether the agency’s action was “reasonable and reasonably explained.”

Id.

(quoting FCC v.

Prometheus Radio Project,

592 U.S. 414

, 423 (2021)). That is, the court must ensure that the

agency “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action in-

cluding a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’” Motor Vehicle

Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc., v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,

463 U.S. 29, 43

(1983) (citation omit-

ted).

III. Analysis

Plaintiffs argue that EPA erred in three ways related to the 2019 Rule’s enactment: it (1)

8

contravened EPCRA by concluding that animal waste air emissions are no longer reportable under

Section 304(a)(2) following their exemption from CERCLA’s notification requirements; (2) acted

arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to consider the public’s right to access information and by

changing course without explanation; and (3) failed to conduct an environmental impact analysis

under NPA before enacting the rule even though one was required. As explained below, the Court

sides with EPA and Intervenors each time.6

A. The 2019 Rule Does Not Contravene EPCRA Section 304(a)(2) By Not Requir-

ing Notification of Animal Waste Air Emissions From Farms

Animal waste emits substances like ammonia and hydrogen sulfide that are both CERCLA

“hazardous substances” and EPCRA “extremely hazardous substances.”

40 C.F.R. § 302.4

; 40

C.F.R. part 355, App. A. The parties agree that such releases are not reportable under EPCRA

section 304(a)(1) or (a)(3). Recall that these provisions, taken together, require emergency reports

whenever a “release requires a notification under section 103(a)” of CERCLA, whether the sub-

stance is “extremely hazardous” under EPCRA or merely “hazardous” under CERCLA.

42 U.S.C.

§§ 11004

(a)(1), (a)(3). But section 103(a) of CERCLA no longer requires notification of air emis-

sions from animal waste, so neither do these two EPCRA provisions. Thus, the parties agree that

whether such releases are reportable under EPCRA turns on whether the third provision—section

304(a)(2)—requires it. That provision provides:

6

Although EPA “does not contest standing as to all Plaintiffs,” it “notes” in passing that

two organizations—Sound Rivers and Waterkeeper Alliance—“allege injury based purely on pre-

sumed decreases in water quality, which the Rule does not affect” and thus they lack standing.

ECF No. 86 at 13 n.2. But “[i]f one party has standing in an action, a court need not reach the

issue of standing of other parties when it makes no difference to the merits.” Noel Canning v.

NLRB,

705 F.3d 490, 514

(D.C. Cir. 2013) (citation omitted). And no party disputes that the 2019

Rule “inflicts . . . informational injury” on all other plaintiffs. Waterkeeper Alliance,

853 F.3d at

533

. As a result of EPA’s allegedly unlawful decision to no longer require that releases be publicly

disclosed, the organizations “no longer have a statutory right to access it.”

Id.

So standing is no

impediment to addressing Plaintiffs’ claims.

9

If a release of an extremely hazardous substance referred to in section 11002(a) of

this title occurs from a facility at which a hazardous chemical is produced, used, or

stored, and such release is not subject to the notification requirements under section

103(a) of CERCLA, the owner or operator of the facility shall immediately provide

notice . . . , but only if the release—

(A) is not a federally permitted release as defined in section 101(10) of CERCLA,

(B) is in an amount in excess of a quantity which the Administrator has determined

(by regulation) requires notice, and

(C) occurs in a manner which would require notification under section 103(a) of

CERCLA.

42 U.S.C. § 11004

(a)(2) (emphases added).

Section 304(a)(2)’s first requirement—that a release is “not subject to” CERCLA section

103(a) reporting—is, as described above, just the flip side of the fact that section 304(a)(1) and

(a)(3) apply only when a notification is required under CERCLA section 103(a). Plaintiffs and

EPA, consistent with their acknowledgment that 304(a)(1) and (a)(3) do not require notifications

of air emissions from animal waste, also agree that 304(a)(2)’s first requirement is fulfilled. See

ECF No. 91 at 21; ECF No. 86 at 15, 17. Their reasoning is simple: Congress expressly exempted

air emissions from animal waste. See 42 U.S.C § 9603(e). The Court agrees with them that the

emissions at issue here—because they are expressly exempted—are “not subject to” CERCLA

section 103(a)’s notification requirements for purposes of Section 304(a)(2).7

7

Consistent with this conclusion, Plaintiffs and EPA appear to read the statute to mean that

releases are “not subject to” CERCLA section 103(a) reporting for purposes of Section 304(a)(2)

in either of two situations: the released substance is either not a “hazardous substance” under that

statute, see id. § 9601(14), or the release itself is not covered by the statute, either because it is

excluded from CERCLA’s definition of “release,” id. § 9601(22), or it is exempted from reporting

under the pesticide, animal waste air emissions, or continuous release exemptions, see id.

§§ 9603(e), (f). The Court agrees with this straightforward reading.

Intervenors, while still arguing that the 2019 Rule is lawful, advance a different reading of

the phrase “is not subject to notification requirements under [CERCLA] section 103(a),” which

10

The parties also agree that air emissions from animal waste at farms can satisfy Section

304(a)(2)’s provisions (A) and (B)—they are not federally permitted releases and can occur above

the reportable quantity. Thus, narrowed further, what remains of the dispute is whether these re-

leases “occur[] in a manner which would require notification under section 103(a).” If these emis-

sions occur in such a manner, then reporting is required, and the 2019 Rule contravenes EPCRA.

If the emissions do not occur in such a manner, reporting is not required, and the 2019 Rule does

not contravene EPCRA.

Congress did not specify further in EPCRA what it means for a release to “occur in a man-

ner” that would trigger section 103(a) reporting. So the Court “affords” that phrase “its ordinary

or natural meaning.” HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refin., LLC v. Renewable Fuels Ass’n,

594 U.S.

382

, 388 (2021) (citation omitted). Whether the Court looks to the present definition of “manner”

or that in 1986 when Congress passed EPCRA, its meaning is the same. The word means “kind,”

“sort,” “nature,” “character,” and “condition,” Manner, Webster’s Third Int’l Dictionary 1376

(1986), or simply “the way in which something occurs.” Manner, Oxford English Dictionary

III.9.a., https://perma.cc/X7E3-G9W9.

Still in lockstep, Plaintiffs and EPA agree that what matters is the nature of the release, or

the way in which a substance is released into the environment. ECF No. 93 at 7; ECF No. 91 at

12. And the parties also seem to agree that CERCLA’s definition of “release” supplies at least

then informs their interpretation of the phrase “occurs in a manner which would require notifica-

tion.” ECF No. 89 at 17–18. They argue that the first phrase means only that “a substance is not

listed as a ‘hazardous substance’ under CERCLA.”

Id.

This reading is inconsistent with Interve-

nors’ own position—noted above—that for purposes of EPCRA section 304(a)(1) and (a)(3), a

release requires “notification under section 103(a) of CERCLA if it involves a ‘hazardous sub-

stance’ (within the meaning of CERCLA) and none of the exemptions from CERCLA section

103(a) reporting apply.” ECF No. 89 at 17 (emphasis in brief). And more to the point, it conflicts

with what CERCLA’s plain text says about when its notification requirements kick in, which de-

pends on much more than whether a substance is listed as hazardous.

11

part of the answer: “any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, in-

jecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment” is subject to immediate

reporting.

42 U.S.C. § 9601

(22). The nature of reportable “releases” is even further refined within

that statutory provision: “any release which results in exposure to persons solely within a work-

place,” “emissions from engine exhaust or motor vehicle,” certain releases from nuclear waste

incidents, and “the normal application of fertilizer” are not reportable.

Id.

At first, Plaintiffs argue that the inquiry ends there. They say that because CERCLA’s

“release” definition sets out the “manner[s]” in which a substance may enter the environment, if a

release meets that definition, it therefore “occurs in a manner which would require notification

under section 103(a) of CERCLA.” ECF No. 83-1 at 19–20. Thus, if such releases also satisfy

section 304(a)’s other requirements, then they must be reported under EPCRA. See

id.

Applied

here, because air emissions from animal waste are “emit[ed] . . . into the environment,”

42 U.S.C.

§ 9601

(22), and are not types of releases excluded from CERCLA’s “release” definition, Plaintiffs

contend that those releases “occur[] in a manner which would require notification” under CER-

CLA, ECF No. 83-1 at 19–20.

The problem for Plaintiffs, though, is that the definition of “release” in section 9601(22) is

not the only way in which CERCLA sketches out what “manner” of release requires reporting.

Before turning to the animal waste provision at issue, consider section 103(f). It exempts from

immediate reporting any release that is “continuous” and “stable in quantity and rate,” so long as

other notification requirements are met.

42 U.S.C. § 9603

(f)(2). A release that “occurs in [that]

manner” would not “require notification under section 103(a),” even if it is not excluded from

CERCLA’s release definition. Indeed, EPA clarified in the 1987 Rule that CERCLA’s continu-

ous-release exemption carries over to EPCRA for that very reason. See 52 Fed. Reg. at 13384

12

(“continuous releases” are “not reportable under section 304” because “such releases do not ‘occur

in a manner’ which requires immediate reporting under section 103(a)”).

Thus, as this example shows they must, Plaintiffs concede in their reply that Congress can

further modify what “manner[s]” of release require reporting under CERCLA. See ECF No. 91 at

12–15. “By incorporating and modifying the manners of release that require notification under

CERCLA,” they acknowledge, Congress “identifie[d] a manner of release”—releases that occur

“with a certain frequency”—that do not “occur in a manner” requiring section 103(a) reporting

and so do not trigger EPCRA section 304(a)(2) reporting. Id. at 13. Plaintiffs agree that “Congress

can narrow the manners of release that require notification under CERCLA” not only “by creating

an exemption from CERCLA’s definition of ‘release’” but also by “creating an exemption . . . that

incorporates and modifies the manners of release that require notification.” Id. at 15.

That spells trouble for Plaintiffs—because it is what Congress did in enacting the FARM

Act’s exemption for “air emissions from animal waste . . . at a farm.”

42 U.S.C. § 9603

(e)(1)(B).

That exemption expressly “incorporates” a manner of release—“emitting”—and modifies it by

specifying that substances emitted from animal waste at a farm into the air do not require reporting.

That is, releases of this “nature,” or substances released into the environment “in this way,” do not

require reporting, although the same substances in animal waste released into the environment in

a different manner—for instance, dumping animal waste into a waterway—do. Contrast that ex-

emption with CERCLA’s exemption for petroleum.

Id.

§ 9601(14). There, Congress specified no

way in which petroleum is released into the environment; instead, it excluded such releases from

CERCLA section 103(a) reporting generally—meaning they may still require reporting under

EPCRA section 304(a)(2). See 84 Fed. Reg. at 27536.

Plaintiffs argue that emitting “into the air . . . describes the destination of emissions, not

13

‘the manner in which [they] enter the environment.’” ECF No. 91 at 18 (emphasis in brief). But

that is too cramped a view of what it means to “occur[]” in a “manner.”

42 U.S.C. § 11004

(a)(2).

Again, Congress specified in section 9603(e)(1)(B) that substances emitted from animal waste into

the air do not require reporting. The source and the destination of the substances at issue—the

“from” and the “to”—are just as much a part of the “nature” of the release or the “way in which”

the substances reach the environment as is the fact that they are emitted. All the more telling,

Plaintiffs elsewhere argue that Congress “narrow[ed]” a “manner[] of release” by exempting

“emissions from the engine exhaust of a motor vehicle” from CERCLA reporting and thus from

EPCRA’s notification requirements. ECF No. 91 at 15. They do not explain how Congress could

properly narrow “the manner[] of release” there by specifying the emitted substance’s source (and

implicitly, its destination, because a motor vehicle’s exhaust is invariably emitted into the air) but

that here, Congress could not narrow the manner of release by specifying the substance’s source

and (explicitly) its destination. Plaintiffs concede that “emissions from engine exhaust of a motor

vehicle” do not “occur[] in a manner which would require notification under section 103(a) of

CERCLA.” So too here with respect to “air emissions from animal waste.” Thus, the 2019 Rule

does not contravene EPCRA.8

EPA’s regulations reinforce this reading of the text. Though of course not controlling,

8

Intervenors, building on their misreading of phrase “is not subject to notification require-

ments under [CERCLA] section 103(a),” understand the phrase “occurs in a manner which would

require notification” to ask only whether the release would require notification under CERCLA

“if that substance were also listed as a ‘hazardous substance’ under” that statute. ECF No. 89 at

18 (emphasis omitted). But under that reading, all CERCLA exemptions would automatically

carry over to EPCRA, which is inconsistent with its text. As EPA notes, it would “render the

phrase ‘occurs in a manner’ to be a nullity.” ECF No. 93 at 11. If an automatic carry-over were

what Congress had intended, it could have required reporting under section 304(a)(2) “only if the

release . . . would require notification under section 103(a) of CERCLA”—or it could have omitted

section 304(a)(2) altogether.

14

“interpretations issued contemporaneously with [the enactment of] the statute at issue, and which

have remained consistent over time,” are still helpful. See Loper Bright,

603 U.S. at 394

; Skidmore

v. Swift & Co.,

323 U.S. 134

, 139–40 (1944). And here, EPA’s decades-old interpretation of the

interplay between CERCLA section 103 and EPCRA section 304 mirrors its treatment of CER-

CLA’s exemption for air emissions from animal waste and corresponds with the statutory lan-

guage. In the 1987 Rule, as explained, EPA clarified that CERCLA’s reporting exemption for

continuous releases applies equally to EPCRA because “such releases do not ‘occur in a manner’

which requires immediate release reporting under section 103(a) of CERCLA.” 52 Fed. Reg. at

13384; see

40 C.F.R. § 355.32

; see also 55 Fed. Reg. at 30179 (1990 Rule codifying definitions

of “continuous” and “statistically significant” and explaining that “continuous and stable” releases

“do not occur in a manner that requires notification under CERCLA section 103(a)”). In that rule,

EPA also carried over CERCLA’s exemption for the “application of a registered pesticide gener-

ally in accordance with its purpose” and the statute’s exemptions for the “types of releases” ex-

cluded from CERCLA’s “release” definition.” 52 Fed. Reg. at 13385; see

40 C.F.R. §§ 355.31

(c),

(d). But releases of “petroleum,” EPA noted, may still require EPCRA reporting because petro-

leum is excluded from CERCLA’s “hazardous substance” definition yet “no such exclusion exists”

under EPCRA. 52 Fed. Reg. at 13385. So where CERCLA exempts a release based on the “way

in which” it occurs—but not where it exempts only a specific substance—EPA has consistently

considered it not to occur in a manner which would require notification under section 103(a) for

purposes of EPCRA’s section 304(a)(2). The 2019 Rule follows that rationale.

Plaintiffs make much of the fact that, in 2008, EPA purported to exempt all animal feeding

operations from CERCLA reporting but “continued to require the largest AFOs . . . to report emis-

sions under EPCRA.” ECF No. 91 at 25. In their view, EPA “clearly understood” then “that a

15

CERCLA exemption does not require a parallel exemption under EPCRA.” Id. at 25–26. But the

2008 Rule is irrelevant to EPA’s treatment of the two statutes’ interplay or its interpretation of

EPCRA section 304(a)(2): at that time, there was no statutory exemption for air emissions from

animal waste farms. EPA instead reasoned that “reports” of those releases were, for the most part,

“unnecessary,” and the agency relied on “unrelated exemptions” as evidence that it “c[ould] create

new exemptions like those in the Final Rule.” Waterkeeper Alliance,

853 F.3d at 530, 534

(em-

phases in original). And the D.C. Circuit held that EPA lacked authority to do that—none of the

“provisions even hint[ed] at the type of reporting exemption the EPA adopted.”

Id. at 535

. So the

2008 Rule does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, “prove” that EPA has inconsistently interpreted EPCRA

section 304. ECF No. 91 at 25.

Plaintiffs also put too much weight on EPA’s actions in this litigation—that it moved for a

remand to “initiate a new rulemaking to revise or rescind the [2019] Rule.” ECF No. 91 at 26.

That makes no sense, Plaintiffs contend, “if EPA understood EPCRA to require an exemption for

air emissions from animal waste.”

Id.

But EPA’s motion for a remand followed the Biden admin-

istration’s directive to “review” and “take action to address” all regulations promulgated by the

prior administration “that conflict[ed] with” the new administration’s objectives. ECF No. 58 at

10–11. Beyond that, the Court will not speculate what motivated EPA’s request for a remand, but

simply decide the question before it.

For these reasons, CERCLA’s exemption for air emissions from animal waste at farms—

an exemption targeting the “nature” of such releases, or the “way in which” these releases hap-

pen—means that such releases do not “occur in a manner” that requires section 103(a) reporting

for purposes of EPCRA’s section 304(a)(2). Thus, EPA’s 2019 Rule does not contravene EPCRA.

B. The 2019 Rule Is Not Arbitrary or Capricious

Plaintiffs argue that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in enacting the 2019 Rule.

16

“An agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if it ‘relied on factors which Congress has not

intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an

explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible

that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.’” Cablevi-

sion Sys. Corp. v. FCC,

649 F.3d 695, 714

(D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n,

463 U.S. at 43

).

EPA did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in eliminating the EPCRA reporting require-

ment in the 2019 Rule. It explained that the 2019 Rule exempting from EPCRA reporting air

emissions from animal waste at farms responded to Congress’s passage of the FARM Act and was

“based on the relationship of the EPCRA section 304 reporting requirements to the CERCLA sec-

tion 103 reporting requirements.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 27535. “EPCRA Section 304(a)(2) promotes

consistency between” those requirements, EPA reasoned, “by ensuring that only releases that ‘oc-

cur[] in a manner’ that would require CERCLA notification be reported under EPCRA.” Id. And

because Congress “exempted” from section 103 reporting “releases of a certain kind of manner,”

EPA explained that “these types of releases” “no longer ‘occur[] in a manner’ that would require

notification” and thus are exempt from EPCRA section 304 reporting. Id. at 27535, 27540. EPA

also considered—and rejected—arguments in opposition, including that the proposed rule contra-

dicted “the plain language of EPCRA and CERCLA” and clashed with the FARM Act’s legislative

history. See id. at 27538–40. EPA’s 2019 Rule is consistent with the best reading of section

304(a)(2) and “provides a reasoned explanation” for exempting animal waste air emissions from

EPCRA’s emergency notification requirement. Env’t Def. Fund, 124 F.4th at 5. Thus, the 2019

Rule is not arbitrary or capricious.

Plaintiffs argue that “EPA entirely failed to consider” what Plaintiffs say is EPCRA’s

17

“central premise”: “the public’s right to access information about releases of extremely hazardous

substances.” ECF No. 83-1 at 25–26; ECF No. 91 at 31. The Court agrees that “the public’s right

to access information concerning potential chemical hazards in their communities” underlies sev-

eral of EPCRA’s provisions. Nat’l Oilseed Processors Ass’n v. Browner,

924 F. Supp. 1193, 1197

(D.D.C. 1996); see

42 U.S.C. §§ 11021

(c)(2), 11022(e)(3), 11044(a). But it is not EPCRA’s “only

goal, and Congress did not pursue [it] to the n th degree.” Holder v. Martinez Gutierrez,

566 U.S.

583, 594

(2012). Together with CERCLA, “EPCRA” also “establishes a framework of state, re-

gional, and local agencies designed . . . to provide for emergency response in the event of health-

threatening release.” Steel Co.,

523 U.S. at 86

(emphasis added). Section 304 is a key component.

As EPA explained when it published the 2019 Rule, “[t]he basic purpose of emergency release

notification requirements under EPCRA section 304 is for facilities to inform state and local agen-

cies of accidental releases so that these agencies can exercise the local emergency response plan if

necessary.” 84 Fed. Reg. at 27538. And to that end, Congress “expressly tied” EPCRA’s emer-

gency reporting requirements to CERCLA’s. Waterkeeper Alliance,

853 F.3d at 534

; see H.R.

Conf. Rep. 99-962, 284, reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3276, 3377. EPA considered this inter-

play and concluded, consistent with the statutory text, that Congress’s CERCLA exemption for air

emissions from animal waste at farms meant such releases were also exempted from EPCRA sec-

tion 304 reporting. EPA had no leeway to consider the public’s right to access information. Nor

could it “rewrite [the] statute’s plain text to correspond to” EPCRA’s other “purposes.” Landstar

Exp. Am., Inc. v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n,

569 F.3d 493, 498

(D.C. Cir. 2009). EPA acknowledged as

much in its response to public comments, explaining that “[c]omments regarding information

availability or data availability are outside the scope of this rulemaking,” which was “a statutory

matter.” ECF No. 86-1 at 24.

18

Trying a different tack, Plaintiffs contend that “[t]he 2019 Rule represents an about-face”

that EPA failed to adequately explain. ECF No. 83-1 at 27. Plaintiffs again point to the 2008

Rule, where EPA supposedly “understood that an exemption from CERCLA did not require an

exemption from EPCRA” because it continued to require large animal feeding operations to report

animal waste air emissions under EPCRA.

Id.

But the Court has already explained why the va-

cated 2008 Rule is irrelevant—EPA did not purport to interpret EPCRA section 304(a) in exempt-

ing these releases. So EPA could not have “changed its interpretation of EPCRA” since then. ECF

No. 83-1 at 27. Moreover, because it was Congress, not EPA, that exempted air emissions from

animal waste from CERCLA’s reporting requirements—and thus from EPCRA’s notification

scheme—it is also irrelevant whether EPA saw good reason to continue EPCRA reporting for a

subset of farms in 2008.

Id.

C. NEPA Did Not Require EPA to Evaluate the Environmental Effects of the

2019 Rule

Plaintiffs’ final challenge to the 2019 Rule—that EPA flouted NEPA—fares no better.

ECF No. 83-1 at 28–30. EPA and Intervenors are right that NEPA does not apply. ECF No. 86 at

26; ECF No. 89 at 31. “[I]ntended to reduce or eliminate environmental damage,” NEPA imposes

certain “procedural requirements on federal agencies with a particular focus on requiring [them]

to undertake analyses of the environmental impact of their proposals and actions.” DOT v. Public

Citizen,

541 U.S. 752

, 756–57 (2004) (citation omitted). At times, agencies must prepare an En-

vironmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) detailing, among other things, the environmental impact of

the proposed action, any unavoidable adverse environmental effects, and alternatives to the pro-

posed action.

42 U.S.C. § 4332

(2)(C). But a caveat dooms Plaintiffs’ claim: when “an agency has

no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant action,”

NEPA does not apply. See Public Citizen,

541 U.S. at 770

. Simply put, if the agency lacks

19

“discretion to affect the outcome of its actions,” then “the information that NEPA provides can

have no [e]ffect on the agency’s action.” Citizens Against Rails–to–Trails,

267 F.3d 1144, 1151

(D.C. Cir. 2001); see Sierra Club v. FERC,

867 F.3d 1357, 1372

(D.C. Cir. 2017) (“An agency

has no obligation to gather or consider environmental information if it has no statutory authority

to act on that information.” (emphasis in original)).

Take Sierra Club v. FERC, where the D.C. Circuit held that the Federal Energy Regulatory

Commission, in licensing upgrades to liquefied natural gas terminals, need not evaluate climate-

change effects of exporting natural gas.

827 F.3d 36, 47

(D.C. Cir. 2016). Relying on Public

Citizen, the Court reasoned that the Commission had no legal authority to consider the environ-

mental effects of those exports and thus no NEPA obligation stemming from those effects.

Id.

In

Sierra Club v. Department of Agriculture, by contrast, the agency could not skirt NEPA’s require-

ments in approving and financially assisting the expansion of a power plant because it could con-

dition its approval on “[a]ny . . . such terms and conditions as [the agency], in its sole discretion,

may require at such time.”

777 F. Supp. 2d 44

, 64–66 (D.D.C. 2011). That “discretion g[ave] the

agency sufficient leverage to take environmental impacts of its actions into account when making

decisions,” so NEPA applied with full force.

Id. at 66

.

This case is just like Public Citizen and Sierra Club v. FERC. As explained above, Con-

gress’s exemption for air emissions from animal waste at farms from CERCLA section 103 re-

porting means those releases are also exempt from EPCRA section 304 notification. “[A]ll of

EPCRA’s reporting mandates are piggybacked on the CERCLA mandates,” Waterkeeper Alliance,

853 F.3d at 533

, and the statute gives EPA no discretion to consider environmental effects. It

“simply lack[ed] the power to act on whatever information might be contained in [an] EIS,” Public

Citizen,

541 U.S. at 768

, because “the FARM Act compelled EPA to issue the [2019] Rule.” ECF

20

No. 93 at 14; ECF No. 94 at 16. So EPA “ha[d] no obligation to gather or consider environmental

information” and thus did not run afoul NEPA. Sierra Club,

President Donald Trump’s budget request for fiscal year 2026 includes no money for the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, which can precisely show where carbon dioxide is being emitted and absorbed and how well crops are growing.

NASA said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the missions were “beyond their prime mission” and being terminated “to align with the President’s agenda and budget priorities.”

But the missions — a free-flying satellite launched in 2014 and an instrument attached to the International Space Station in 2019 that include technology used in the Hubble Space Telescope — still are more sensitive and accurate than any other systems in the world, operating or planned, and a “national asset” that should be saved, said David Crisp, a retired NASA scientist who led their development.

They helped scientists discover, for example, that the Amazon rain forest emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs, while boreal forests in Canada, Russia and places where permafrost is melting absorb more than they emit, Crisp said.

They also can detect the “glow” of photosynthesis in plants, which helps monitor drought and predict food shortages that can lead to civil unrest and famine, he said.

WATCH: EPA plans to overturn scientific finding used to regulate carbon emissions

“This is really critical,” Crisp said. “We’re learning so much about this rapidly changing planet.”

The decision to end the missions is “extremely shortsighted,” said Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Michigan.

“The observations provided by these satellites … (are) critical for managing growing climate change impacts around the planet, including in the U.S.,” he said.

Looking to Congress

Crisp and others hope Congress will vote to preserve funding for the missions, which are funded through the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.

A bill in the House closely aligns with the president’s request and would eliminate the missions, while a Senate version preserves them. But with Congress in recess, it is unclear whether a budget will be adopted before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1.

If it doesn’t, Congress could adopt a resolution to continue current funding until a budget is passed, though some lawmakers fear the Trump administration could try to delay or withhold that money.

Congressional Democrats warned acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy last month that it would be illegal to terminate missions or impound funds already appropriated by Congress.

Experts said the administration’s move to eliminate funding aligns with other actions to cut or bury climate science.

“The principle seems to be that if we stop measuring climate change it will just disappear from the American consciousness,” said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann.

Backup plan

Crisp and others also are trying to put together a coalition of outside partners — including from Japan and Europe — that could fund and operate the instrument attached to the space station. NASA said it will accept outside proposals through Aug. 29.

The free-flying satellite, though, is at risk of being brought down, meaning it would burn up in the atmosphere. National Public Radio first reported that NASA employees were making plans to end the missions.

Crisp said advocates are hoping NASA also allows outside control of that satellite, which covers more of the globe, but there are legal hurdles to overcome because it would mean giving control of a U.S. satellite to a group that could include foreign partners.

“We’re going out to billionaires. We’re going out to foundations,” Crisp said. “But … it’s a really, really bad idea to try and push it off onto private industry or private individuals or private donors. It just doesn’t make sense.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/OCO-Observatory-High.max-1000x500-e1754592948604.jpg,N,,2025-08-07 23:59:36.752040

Federal 'Solar for All' program may be cut, putting $156 million for Nevada at risk

The Environmental Protection Agency's $7 billion grant program was funded by the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act. In 2024, 60 nonprofit groups, tribes and states were allotted the funding.

Channel 13 contacted the Nevada Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) — the distributor of the grant for our state. CEO Kirsten Stasio said as of Wednesday, the organization has not received a termination notice.

Since its launch, the ""Solar for All"" program has received interest from over 300 single-family households in Nevada, according to the NCEF.

Funding for solar came under threat earlier this year, when the Trump Administration started freezing federal funds for various programs.

In February, Congresswoman Susie Lee weighed in on the funding freeze, so we followed up with her team. They sent us the following statement:

""Ending Solar for All is a loser deal for Nevada. It will do two things: 1) Kill clean energy jobs and 2) raise electricity costs for Nevada families.

Tony Evers today sent a letter to the Trump Administration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, amid reports of forthcoming actions from the Trump Administration to terminate the critical Solar for All Grant Program, which is designed to help fund the installation of solar systems for low- and moderate-income households, boost energy resilience, improve air quality, and create jobs, while helping to lower energy bills for working families.

In April 2024, Wisconsin was awarded $62.4 million after a competitive application process through the Solar for All program to create the “PowerUp Wisconsin” initiative that, based on initial estimates, could serve over 7,400 Wisconsin households and save households up to $500 a year.

A copy of the governor’s letter to U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is available here, and a transcript of the letter is available below.

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

I write to strongly oppose reportedly forthcoming actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) attempting to terminate Solar for All grant awards and ask you to reconsider your actions. On August 5, the New York Times reported that the EPA is currently drafting termination letters to Solar for All grant recipients, including states like Wisconsin. To be clear, attempting to terminate Solar for All grants has no legitimate purpose or justification. Beyond that, doing so will also negatively impact Wisconsinites and our state, causing increased energy bills for Wisconsinites and hurting efforts to improve air quality, boost resilience, and create good-paying jobs.

In April 2024, Wisconsin was awarded $62.4 million after a competitive application process through the EPA’s Solar for All program to help fund solar systems for low- and moderate-income households across Wisconsin. Since then, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation has been engaging relevant stakeholders such as local governments, solar installers, utilities, and housing developers and actively developing program guidelines for Wisconsin’s Solar for All program, “PowerUp Wisconsin.” Wisconsin’s program is designed to support single-family, multi-family, and community solar projects across the state, lowering our reliance on out-of-state energy and saving families money on their energy bills. Based on initial estimates, PowerUp Wisconsin could serve over 7,400 Wisconsin households and save a Wisconsin household up to $500 a year.

Lowering costs for Wisconsin families is a top priority for my administration. We have taken important actions to do just that, including recently eliminating the sales tax on household energy bills for all Wisconsinites in the bipartisan state budget I signed last month. While the Trump Administration claims to share this priority, terminating Wisconsin’s Solar for All grant would have the exact opposite effect, preventing Wisconsin families and households from seeing the direct savings offered through PowerUp Wisconsin. At a time when energy demand continues to increase, it is unfathomable for the Trump Administration to unnecessarily—and potentially illegally—terminate funding for a program designed to deploy affordable, renewable energy systems.

I urge you to abandon any efforts to terminate Solar for All grant awards and focus your time and efforts on meaningful solutions to help lower energy costs for working families and build the sustainable, clean energy future Wisconsinites and Americans want, need, and deserve.

Respectfully yours,

Tony Evers

At a hearing in May, Charleston attorney Matt Edling argued the oil companies had misled the public about the dangers of fossil fuels.
Christopher Mills, a constitutional law expert and principal at Spero Law in Charleston, said the dismissal was expected.
“The dismissal of the City of Charleston’s climate lawsuit is a victory for common sense and the rule of law,” he said.
“This case was part of a coordinated, ESG-driven campaign to shake down energy companies and impose climate policy through litigation rather than legislation.","“The U.S. Constitution makes certain matters the exclusive domain of federal law for good reason,” Young wrote. “If all fifty states, let alone the tens of thousands of political subdivisions therein, were permitted to apply their own laws to such federal issues as interstate and international emissions, the result would be conflicting state standards that would be impossible for energy companies to navigate – what the U.S. Supreme Court called a ‘chaotic confrontation between sovereign states.’”

Young added that the courts are not the appropriate venue for crafting climate policy.

At a hearing in May, Charleston attorney Matt Edling argued the oil companies had misled the public about the dangers of fossil fuels.

“You saw that it could be a calamitous problem, have benefit from it economically to extraordinary disadvantage of cities like Charleston,” Edling said.

He added that the companies “made herculean efforts to convince the world that it wasn’t a problem.”

Attorneys for the oil companies responded that the city of Charleston continues to use fossil fuels and said some companies have made big investments in renewable energy.

“That theory obviously makes no sense,” Merritt Abney, an attorney for BP, said in May.

Abney called the city’s claims about consumer deception over branding efforts unfounded.

In the ruling, Young also criticized the legal scope of Charleston’s complaint.

“Under Plaintiff’s theory, virtually anyone could be a plaintiff – and a defendant – in what would effectively amount to a perpetual series of lawsuits that reset after every storm,” he wrote.

The decision comes after similar lawsuits were dismissed around the country.

“This ruling adds to a ‘growing chorus’ of climate lawsuit dismissals by federal and state courts, including in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and California,” Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr. of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, counsel for Chevron Corporation, said. “States and municipalities cannot pursue climate change litigation under state laws, because such claims are precluded and preempted by federal law under clear U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Judge Young rejected Plaintiffs’ ‘artful’ attempts to frame its claims as solely about consumer deception, holding that ‘Plaintiff cannot avoid that its claims turn on emissions.’ ‘These lawsuits promise to create a chaotic web of conflicting legal obligations for Defendants as each state . . . imposes its own de facto regulations on the worldwide production, marketing, transport, and sale of fossil fuels. Neither federal nor South Carolina law permits such a result.’”

Cases still remain unresolved in Hawaii, Minnesota, Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.

Legal experts praised the South Carolina court’s decision.

“The South Carolina Court of Common Pleas opinion dismissing the City of Charleston’s meritless climate change deception lawsuit represents a victory for the rule of law and the proper allocation of authority within our system of government,” Donald Kochan, executive director of the Law & Economics Center at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, said.

“It recognized that state courts have no business creating new standards for emissions when the federal Congress has reserved for itself authority to regulate in that area. And, in doing so, it stood guard against the assault on the constitutionally designed separation of powers that these cases represent when attempting to turn the courts into engineers of climate change policy,” Kochan added.

Christopher Mills, a constitutional law expert and principal at Spero Law in Charleston, said the dismissal was expected.

“Judge Young followed the clear consensus of courts across the nation, which have agreed that state tort law is not the right avenue to address the complex issue of global climate change,” Mills said. “It would be a shame if the City continued to lend its name to this meritless quest by West Coast trial lawyers to deprive Americans of vital energy resources.”

EPA TO AX $7 BILLION FROM SOLAR PROGRAM FOR HOUSEHOLDS

Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, also welcomed the decision.

“The dismissal of the City of Charleston’s climate lawsuit is a victory for common sense and the rule of law,” he said. “This case was part of a coordinated, ESG-driven campaign to shake down energy companies and impose climate policy through litigation rather than legislation. The judge was right to throw it out.”",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AP22075815568453.webp,N,,2025-08-08 02:01:32.792903

Mercedes AMG has unveiled its newest concept car, the GT XX, which hides even greater concepts under the hood.

AMG’s axial-flux motor is unlike the average electric vehicle model. Compared to conventional motors, the flux is lighter and smaller, but provides greater efficient output. Radial flux designs have gained some popularity in the market, but AMG’s flux stands out by including a disc-shaped stator rather than a tubular model. Spinning parallel to the shaft, the motor is one-third of the weight, but includes double the torque and three times the power density.

Inside the axial flux motor, NCMA, or Nickel Cobalt Manganese Aluminum compounded cells, are oil-cooled. The cathode for these lithium-ion batteries adds aluminum to create energy density and capacity. This all takes place while improving the batteries’ structural integrity. The over 800-volt battery contains more than 3,000 NCMA cells. The pack, given the size, allows for 850-kilowatt fast charging.

The Mercedes AMG GT XX model contains three axial-flux batteries to create 1,340 horsepower and a top speed of 220 miles per hour. Housed in an electric drive unit, two motors sit in the rear, producing 860 horsepower. The other is housed in the front with a spur-gear transmission, producing the remainder of the output.

Mercedes’ concept has already been declared road-ready, which could help push it toward further production. Before that happens, though, the company plans to conduct additional drive and durability testing for the futuristic concept model.

Others in the group were quick to chime in, adding their perspectives to the rising cost of road charging.
It’s Not Just the Price Tag, It’s the Context KD’s Rivian charging experience isn’t just about a few expensive sessions.
Residential electricity rates, especially if you charge at night or use solar, can be less than one-third the cost of road charging.
The real cost savings from EVs generally come from home charging, not public fast charging.","This evening, I was scrolling through the “RIVIAN Electric Vehicles Discussion” group on Facebook when I came across a post that made me stop and think. KD, a fellow Rivian owner, had just shared something that might sound all too familiar for many of us who rely heavily on public charging: the numbers aren’t adding up. Not in the way most of us were promised when we first made the switch to electric.

KD explained their frustration with the cost of road charging in a recent post:

“I’m finding out that charging a Rivian costs more than charging my Tesla. I recently paid almost $50 for just 180 miles, and the last time, 240 miles cost me $80. This doesn’t feel like saving on gas, especially since I’m not charging at home but on the road.”

When you break that down, it’s close to 27 cents per mile, higher than many gas-powered SUVs, especially when gas prices are on the lower side. The situation becomes even more concerning when you realize that KD isn’t an outlier. Others in the group were quick to chime in, adding their perspectives to the rising cost of road charging.

It’s Not Just the Price Tag, It’s the Context

KD’s Rivian charging experience isn’t just about a few expensive sessions. It reflects a broader issue that a growing number of EV owners are starting to vocalize: if you’re not charging at home, the savings can quickly disappear.

John, a group member who responded to KD’s post, put it into perspective:

“It’s a large truck, so it uses a lot more energy. The battery is nearly twice the size of most Teslas. This charger also seems pretty expensive. Based on the address, it’s Electrify America. Tesla Superchargers will be quite a bit cheaper per kWh, especially with the membership, which I’d recommend if you do much road tripping; the breakeven point is around a 65% charge. DC fast charging isn’t cheap either; it’s often close to the same price as gas, if not more, depending on the area. The real savings come from charging at home.”

That right there is key. A lot of the cost-effectiveness in EV ownership hinges on having regular access to home charging. But when you’re relying entirely on public DC fast charging, you’re often at the mercy of high per-kWh rates, idle fees, and non-optimized locations.

As discussed in a previous Torque News article about long-distance Rivian road trips, it’s not just about cost; it’s also about planning and navigating a network that still has some growing up to do.

Comparing to Tesla: Why the Gap?

Tesla’s ecosystem is often regarded as the gold standard for EV charging, and KD’s comparison between their Tesla and Rivian makes that all the more apparent. For one, Tesla’s Supercharger network is tightly integrated into its vehicles and routing software. But beyond that, Tesla’s pricing, especially with the membership plan, tends to be more reasonable than Electrify America or similar providers.

And let’s not forget: Tesla owners often enjoy exclusive perks. Meanwhile, Rivian drivers, as highlighted in this story about a $250 adapter that didn’t quite work as promised, may find themselves frustrated trying to access the same charging network with less reliability.

Even for those with generous promises at delivery, like this Rivian owner who was told they'd receive a $500 credit and 6 months of free charging, the follow-through hasn’t always matched expectations.

Troy’s Take: When a Diesel Jeep Becomes the Better Option

Another comment that stood out came from Troy, who’s also been tallying up the numbers:

“Yes, sadly, with charging rates getting as high as they are, I’m spending less driving my diesel Jeep Wrangler on 37-inch tall tires than I am driving my R1S. The R1S is more comfortable, of course, but when I add in the time it takes to charge plus the cost of charging, the Jeep is starting to get used more and more for longer trips.”

Let that sink in, a lifted, off-road-focused diesel Jeep with oversized tires is cheaper to run than a modern electric SUV when using public chargers. That flips the entire EV value proposition on its head for many people, especially those who don’t have home chargers or travel often.

Troy’s comment echoes the frustrations many owners have shared in past discussions, from those waiting weeks for Rivian service appointments to others who have hit charging snags during cross-country trips.

The Hidden Cost of Fast Charging

It’s also worth noting how much energy Rivian's consume. These are full-sized trucks and SUVs with big batteries, often over 130 kWh. The upside is a generous range and high performance. The downside? Charging those batteries at a commercial rate gets expensive fast.

Let’s do some quick napkin math:

At $0.49 per kWh (a common rate at many Electrify America stations), a full charge could easily exceed $60. And if that only gets you 250 miles, that’s roughly 24 cents per mile. By contrast, a gas SUV that gets 25 mpg and fills up at $3.50 per gallon comes in around 14 cents per mile.

This doesn’t even touch on the time cost of fast charging, which some Rivian owners have reported can take over an hour depending on conditions and charger output.

So Where Do EV Savings Actually Come From?

The answer is simple: home charging. Residential electricity rates, especially if you charge at night or use solar, can be less than one-third the cost of road charging. This is where EVs truly shine.

But that assumes you have a garage, a Level 2 charger, and the ability to plug in consistently. Without those things, you’re left dealing with unpredictable pricing and the real possibility that, mile for mile, you’re not actually saving money.

For KD, who’s relying solely on road chargers, that’s the current reality.

The Journalist’s Take

I think KD’s story is an important reminder that EV ownership is not a one-size-fits-all equation. It depends on where you live, how you charge, and what your driving habits look like. I’m all for electric vehicles, they’re quiet, clean, and fun to drive, but I also think we need to be honest about what EV ownership looks like without the perfect conditions.

Stories like KD’s and comments from owners like Troy and John are critical because they help balance the hype with the real-world logistics. While many of us love our trucks and SUVs, and the Rivian R1S and R1T are seriously impressive machines, we can’t ignore the financial side of owning one without home charging infrastructure.

And for many, especially first-time EV buyers, that realization might come a little too late.

Key Takeaways

Charging a Rivian on the road can cost as much, or more, than fueling a gas vehicle, especially without a home charger.

Electrify America and other public DC fast chargers often have higher per-kWh rates than Tesla Superchargers.

Tesla’s ecosystem offers better value for those doing long-distance travel, particularly with a membership.

The real cost savings from EVs generally come from home charging, not public fast charging.

Owners relying exclusively on public charging may face sticker shock and frustration, especially in trucks with large battery packs.

Final Thoughts

It’s important to understand the charging ecosystem before jumping into EV ownership. Range is only half the equation; the other half is how, where, and for how much you’re charging. KD’s story shows us what happens when the numbers don’t go as expected, and why EV buyers need to plan beyond just the sticker price and range rating.

What about you?

Have you experienced unexpectedly high charging costs with your EV?

Do you rely mostly on home charging or public chargers, and how does that affect your total cost of ownership?

The program, which was intended to help pay for residential solar projects for more than 900,000 lower-income U.S. households, was cut as part of the Trump administration’s ongoing efforts to block a shift to cleaner energy.

The backstory:

As part of the Biden-era’s Solar for All program, the Washington State Department of Commerce was set to receive $156 million for a program that was scheduled to launch in early 2026. A spokesperson tells FOX 13 Seattle, ""this action by the federal government jeopardizes that.""

The program was expected to not only add more solar energy to Washington’s grid, but also create jobs in the process, including a goal of at least one trainee per project to boost the growing economy surrounding clean energy jobs.

According to the spokesperson, half a million dollars has already been spent to prepare four programs that would have received the funds and distributed them to communities across Washington including tribes, and low-income households.

Big picture view:

Solar, a renewable energy, is widely regarded as a way to introduce cleaner power into the electrical grid and lower energy bills for American consumers.

Under Republican President Donald Trump, officials have pursued dozens of deregulatory measures related to federal rules intended to protect clean air and water. Last week, the EPA proposed rescinding the agency’s ""endangerment finding,"" which serves as the scientific and legal basis for regulating planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin took to social media to announce that the program was eliminated last month.

""The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,″ Zeldin said. ""Today, the Trump EPA is announcing that we are ending Solar for All for good, saving US taxpayers ANOTHER $7 BILLION!""

It remains unclear whether the move would lead to legal action, as Washington’s Attorney General is currently fighting a number of similar funding cuts through the court system.

A spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Commerce noted they’re learning of the cuts as they’re rolled out.

""We’re learning in real time about the administration’s action regarding congressionally mandated funds that are under contract, and what that means for Washignton’s Solar for All program,"" a spokesperson wrote.

Eligible new battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $80,000 or less qualify for a $3,500 state credit. Vehicles with an MSRP of $35,000 or less may qualify for an additional $2,500 incentive.

These state credits can be applied at the dealership and can be combined with federal incentives to increase your savings.

Vehicle Exchange Colorado (VXC) Program

The VXC program helps income-eligible Coloradans trade in older, high-emission vehicles for rebates on new or used EVs. This initiative encourages cleaner air and more affordable EV access.

Eligibility includes:

Colorado residency, age 18 or older, with a valid Colorado driver’s license and address

Household income at or below 80% of the Area Median Income (AMI) or enrollment in qualifying assistance programs (such as SNAP, SSI, Medicaid)

The vehicle being traded in must be at least 12 years old or fail emissions testing, and it must be currently titled and lien-free in your name with the Colorado DMV

Rebates available:

$6,000 for new BEVs and PHEVs

$4,000 for used BEVs and PHEVs

New EVs must have an MSRP of $80,000 or less. Used EVs must have a final negotiated price of $50,000 or less.

These rebates are point-of-sale discounts available at participating dealerships and can be stacked with federal and state credits.

How to Apply for VXC

You can register and apply for the VXC program online. Applications are reviewed within approximately 10 business days. Once approved, rebates must be redeemed at the dealership within 90 days.

When Tesla released its Q2 2025 Update, its performance was generally in line with what analysts expected.
Tesla also pointed to the planned production of its more affordable EV as another reason for shareholders to view the brand through a favorable lens.
As CNBC noted, Tesla has already been ""ceding market share to companies with more affordable EVs.""
In addition to their enticing environmental and public health benefits, EVs have lower energy and maintenance costs compared to gas-powered vehicles.","Tesla's latest financial results suggest the Elon Musk-led company will continue to face challenges in the latter half of 2025 after analysts remained wary of the electric vehicle maker at the close of markets on July 23 — just before Tesla released its second-quarter data.

As Teslarati and TipRanks detailed, Tesla stocks were down roughly 19% year-to-date before markets closed on July 23. Wall Street analysts remained skeptical of the company's prospects, noting broad concerns about the EV market, increased competition, changes in the federal government's approach to EV regulations, and Musk's polarizing political activities.

However, Barclays analyst Dan Levy maintained his Hold rating on Tesla stock with a $275 price target because he believes the company's Robotaxi ambitions could give the brand a major boost in the second half of the year, even though it has ""increasingly weaker fundamentals.""

When Tesla released its Q2 2025 Update, its performance was generally in line with what analysts expected. It reported a 12% year-over-year decline in total revenue at $22.5 billion, whereas analysts polled by LSEG expected a total revenue of $22.74 billion, per CNBC.

Tesla listed a drop in vehicle deliveries, lower regulatory credit revenue, a reduced average sales price of its EVs, lower energy storage and generation revenue, and growth in other services as influencing these results.

The latter factor is a key reason why analysts and Tesla itself remain optimistic despite the company's struggles with brand image, in no small part due to concerns over its supervised Full-Self Driving features and hiccups with the launch of its Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas.

""Q2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla's history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,"" Tesla wrote in its Q2 update.

""... We believe our approach to autonomy — a camera-only architecture with neural networks trained on data from our global fleet of millions of vehicles — allows us to continually improve safety, rapidly scale the network and improve profitability.""

Tesla also pointed to the planned production of its more affordable EV as another reason for shareholders to view the brand through a favorable lens. As CNBC noted, Tesla has already been ""ceding market share to companies with more affordable EVs.""

Even though federal tax credits for qualified EVs in the United States will end on Sept. 30, the International Energy Agency expects that global demand for EVs will continue to remain high, with four times as many EVs on the road in 2030 as there were in 2024.

The company is also applying to expand its existing lease for the Flat Canyon Federal Coal Lease Tract to “increase the tract acreage by 660 acres, adding approximately 2,095,000 tons of contiguous recoverable coal,” according to the analysis.
Also, the life of the Skyline Mine would be extended for 18 months past its January 2032 estimated retirement date.
“(The executive orders) support the domestic coal industry by enhancing coal production and use as a means of securing economic prosperity and national security, lowering electricity costs, and supporting job creation,” the environmental review says.
Spencer Cox commended the action, saying it would “deliver reliable power, rural jobs, and greater American energy independence.” “Energy abundance means economic strength and national security,” he wrote.","A Utah mine is set to be the first in the nation to take advantage of new federal rules expediting leases for coal production on federal land, passed as part of the congressional Republicans’ “Big, Beautiful Bill” last month, the U.S. Department of the Interior said Wednesday.

Canyon Fuel Company, the operator of Carbon County’s Skyline Mine since 1981, is requesting leasing the Little Eccles Federal Coal Lease Tract, comprising up to 120 acres and containing 858,000 to 1,025,000 tons of recoverable coal, according to the environmental impact analysis.

The company is also applying to expand its existing lease for the Flat Canyon Federal Coal Lease Tract to “increase the tract acreage by 660 acres, adding approximately 2,095,000 tons of contiguous recoverable coal,” according to the analysis.

If approved, the developments would produce nearly 3 million tons of recoverable coal on federal land and nearly 4.6 million tons of private coal, in addition to the 40 million tons of coal mined over the last 10 years. Also, the life of the Skyline Mine would be extended for 18 months past its January 2032 estimated retirement date.

“This is a critical step in unleashing the full economic potential of our coal resources and delivering reliable, affordable energy to American families,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management Adam Suess, said in a statement. “President Trump made it clear that we will not tie up American energy in red tape. Under his leadership, we’re cutting delays, boosting production, and putting miners back to work.”

That’s the first coal leasing process accelerated because of the “big, beautiful bill.”

The law required the accelerated processing of pending coal lease applications, giving the Secretary of Interior 90 days to review them, to publish any required environmental review for public comment, establish the fair market value, hold a lease sale and identify the highest bidder for coal tracts. The secretary may also grant additional approvals to previously issued coal leases so mining can start.

The Department of the Interior also highlighted in a news release that the action supported Trump’s executive orders seeking to propel the country’s coal industry.

“(The executive orders) support the domestic coal industry by enhancing coal production and use as a means of securing economic prosperity and national security, lowering electricity costs, and supporting job creation,” the environmental review says. “They further outline a series of policies and actions to remove regulatory barriers, promote coal exports, and assess coal resources on federal lands, while also encouraging the development of coal technologies.”

The Bureau of Land Management will soon open a public comment period to determine the fair value market and the maximum economic recovery of the federal coal in the lease area.

In a social media post, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox commended the action, saying it would “deliver reliable power, rural jobs, and greater American energy independence.”
