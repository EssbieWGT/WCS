Japanese automakers, including Nissan, have had to reassess parts of their strategy in the region as new U.S. trade rules, the expiration of EV tax credits, and reduced demand have created challenges.

The two midsize electric SUVs — one for Nissan and the other for luxury brand Infiniti — were expected to begin production at the automaker’s plant in Mississippi in 2028.

However, the timeline has now been delayed to late 2028 or early 2029, Nikkei reported.

The company had initially planned to launch five electric vehicles in the U.S., but has since canceled development of a small SUV and a sedan, reducing its pipeline to three EV models.

The shift comes after the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ eliminated EV tax credits effective September 30. The Biden-era incentives, worth up to $7,500, were initially aimed at boosting sales of North American-made EVs.

A 2023 revision under the Biden administration expanded eligibility to include leased vehicles made overseas, which lifted EV lease penetration from 10% in early 2023 to 66% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive.

Japanese and South Korean automakers lacking U.S. EV production facilities depended on leasing provisions to maintain their competitive edge.

EV demand faces additional pressure from incentive elimination while also struggling with high vehicle costs, insufficient charging stations, and widespread preference for gasoline SUVs. Currently, EVs account for just 7% of new vehicle sales in the U.S.

In April, EV incentives averaged 14.5% of sticker prices — double that of gasoline cars — but demand remains sluggish.

Meanwhile, Nissan’s battery supplier, AESC, has suspended construction of a plant in South Carolina. If EV demand continues to stagnate, U.S. battery production capacity could become excessive, Nikkei reported, citing a finance industry source.

Separately, Nissan reportedly halted production in May of three Canada-bound models — the Pathfinder and Murano SUVs, built in Tennessee, and the Frontier pickup, produced in Mississippi — following the Trump administration’s decision in April to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports.

Mazda also paused Canada-bound production at its Alabama plant and is shifting output to the U.S. market, the company said.

Other Japanese automakers are also adjusting. Toyota has postponed EV production in Indiana by two years and is increasing the output of hybrid and gasoline versions of the Grand Highlander SUV. Honda has halted the development of a large electric SUV it had positioned as a key product for the U.S. market.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for Nissan was ‘bullish’ amid ‘extremely high’ message volume by late Tuesday.

Nissan’s U.S. shares have declined 26.8% so far this year.

The deficit-boosting bill President Donald Trump signed into law last Friday included provisions that will undermine US clean energy development. Indeed, a team led by Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins estimates that it will reduce US solar and wind output by at least 300 gigawatts by 2035—enough to power some 225 million homes.

But some Republicans still thought the bill didn’t go far enough. After a failed last-minute bid to add further subsidy cuts and an industry-killing renewables tax to the bill, Republicans agreed to vote yes after Trump promised to take matters into his own hands.

He delivered on Monday with an executive order titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.”

The order basically instructs the Treasury Department to deny a developer’s application for soon-to-disappear clean energy subsidies “unless a substantial portion” of their project is already built. It also directs the Department of the Interior to revise policies favoring renewables. “While many executive orders have limited effectiveness, this one might actually have some bite,” says Yale energy economist Kenneth Gillingham.

“The Trump administration is taking every opportunity it can find to assert its authority not to spend money on things with which it disagrees,” says Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “The implications here are enormous.”

Because of the time it takes to permit and site US projects, Gillingham says, the order’s stringent interpretation of the statutory language will have “the effect of quashing the market sooner than would have happened otherwise.”

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders advocating for smarter climate policies, isn’t too pleased with the order. “Just in case last week’s legislative sledgehammer didn’t do enough damage to our economy, our environment, and the pocketbooks of anybody who pays an electricity bill, the Trump administration is taking yet another swing,” he said.

Trump’s decree asserts that renewables threaten “the fiscal health of the Nation,” a claim Gillingham deems entirely false. “Renewables cost something, but they create jobs and generate clean energy.”

“Our workforce is growing, businesses are expanding, and communities are saving money with consistent, reliable energy,” explains Bill Johnson, the owner of Brilliant Harvest, a Florida solar company, but the legislation and subsequent order put that progress at risk, he says.

The order, Keefe told me, suggests that the administration “either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.”

And although Trump questions the reliability of renewables, Gillingham insists that “at the levels of renewable energy we have today, we have nothing to worry about.” He adds, “If anything, adding more renewable capacity could help us meet additional electricity demand.”

As for the notion that the renewable energy market is “dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” well, sure, China dominates the sector, but that’s the result of supportive policies, Gillingham says—and the policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete: “We would have to support our clean energy industries if we wanted to increase our share of clean energy manufacturing.”

Solar company stocks took a hit after the order was released. Gillingham says “the combination of high tariffs and removing the tax credits is a one-two punch that will greatly suppress the market for renewable energy.”

Johnson, the renewable energy businessman, concurs: “These federal policies create uncertainty [which] threatens to stall projects already in the pipeline and make it harder to keep building here at home.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25189618341984.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:01.540664

Trump’s EO Ends Support for “Unreliable” Green Energy

Trump’s administration labeled these renewable sources as unreliable, expensive, and overly dependent on foreign supply chains. According to Trump, clean energy policies threaten U.S. national security, disrupt the electric grid, and harm the natural environment.

This executive order marks a major reversal from the direction set by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats, which offered strong incentives for clean energy projects.

Now, Trump’s energy policy shifts back to conventional energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear—those he calls “reliable and dispatchable.” His administration argues that green energy has received unfair advantages and is weakening the nation’s energy system.

Tax Breaks for Renewables Face the Axe

As part of the executive order, the Treasury Department is now required to end tax credits for wind and solar production. It must also apply stricter rules concerning foreign-controlled companies involved in renewable energy supply chains.

In addition, the Interior Department must revise current policies that have so far favored renewables, such as streamlined permitting and lease arrangements. Both agencies have 45 days to submit detailed reports of their actions to the White House.

Moreover, the order freezes new permits and approvals for wind energy projects, especially offshore developments. Until a full government review is completed, federal agencies are barred from issuing new loans or contracts for wind projects. This decision creates immediate uncertainty in a sector that has been growing rapidly due to both state and federal commitments.

Wind Power at Risk: What’s at Stake

As per EIA, currently, wind energy plays a vital role in the U.S. electricity mix, contributing about 10% of the nation’s power, making it the largest single source of renewable energy. In states like Iowa and South Dakota, wind supplies more than half of all electricity.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over 131,000 Americans are employed in wind energy-related jobs. These workers now face an uncertain future as federal support for their industry is scaled back.

Under the new law, developers will only be able to claim tax benefits for wind and solar projects if construction begins before the end of 2026. Furthermore, these projects must be completed and placed in service by the end of 2027.

Previously, developers could rely on tax incentives through 2032 under the 30% tax credit program. The shorter timeline could discourage companies from launching new renewable projects due to the higher financial risks and increased upfront costs.

Offshore Wind Goals in Limbo for States

This dramatic shift in policy could most severely impact states with ambitious climate targets. For instance, New York aims to install nine gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035, enough to power roughly six million homes. The state has already invested heavily in infrastructure and workforce development to support this target.

Similarly, New Jersey plans to develop 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and transition to a 100% clean energy power sector by 2050.

Offshore wind was a central pillar in both states’ strategies. Now, with federal support in question, these states may be forced to revise their energy roadmaps or find alternative funding solutions. Several state officials have already expressed concerns that their clean energy timelines may slip, which could push critical emissions targets further into the future.

Solar Slowdown: Cheap Power Faces New Roadblocks

The clean energy sector, especially solar, has made remarkable progress in lowering costs. Today, solar energy is one of the cheapest sources of new electricity in the United States. However, despite falling prices, large-scale projects still rely heavily on financial incentives to offset their high upfront expenses.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of new capacity in Q1 2025. This was a 7% drop compared to Q1 2024 and a 43% decrease from Q4 2024.

If these federal benefits are removed, it could significantly slow the pace of new solar developments. It may also discourage private investors at a time when international competition in green energy is heating up.

What’s Next for U.S. Energy Policy Under Trump?

Supporters of the move believe that Trump’s new policy will help restore American energy independence and reduce unnecessary government spending. His energy policy puts the spotlight back on fossil fuels and nuclear power. On his first day back, he declared a “National Energy Emergency” aimed at eliminating what he calls bureaucratic barriers to energy production.

Fossil Fuels Back in the Spotlight

So, as part of this plan, he established the National Energy Dominance Council, which will focus on increasing fossil fuel production, attracting private investment, and accelerating domestic energy production.

According to Trump, returning to traditional energy sources will strengthen the economy, create well-paying jobs, reduce trade deficits, and improve the U.S. position on the global stage.

A Major Clean Energy Setback

Countries across Europe and Asia are increasing their investments in renewables, treating green energy as both an environmental and economic priority.

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, global energy investment is projected to reach $3.3 trillion in 2025.

Out of this, approximately $2.2 trillion will go toward clean energy sources like renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emission fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification. That’s twice the amount, around $1.1 trillion, allocated to fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.

So if the U.S. steps back from clean energy leadership, it could fall behind in both technology development and global market share.

Thus, critics warn that this approach overlooks the long-term risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels, especially in a world already experiencing the impact of climate change.

Many cities, companies, and even Republican-led states have embraced renewables, not just for environmental reasons but also for economic growth. Pulling back federal support now, they say, risks stalling progress and undermining years of clean energy investment.

The Bottom Line: U.S. Climate Goals at Crossroads

In the near term, this executive order is expected to cause major uncertainty across the wind and solar industries. Projects currently in the pipeline could be delayed or canceled entirely.

Developers who had planned on receiving federal tax credits now face stricter deadlines and higher costs. Meanwhile, states will need to reevaluate their clean energy goals and consider alternative funding methods to stay on track.

Over the next several months, federal agencies will begin to implement the executive order. Their decisions and the public and state-level responses will shape the future of U.S. energy policy. Whether this move marks a new era of energy dominance or a costly detour from climate leadership remains to be seen.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2551753511.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:30.918212

Stronger storms often lead to more damage and higher insurance rates.

The aerodynamic shape of Tener's home is built to reduce wind pressure by 30%. Inside, trusses fan out like spokes on a bicycle wheel, distributing storm forces to help keep the roof in place.

""You worry about the wind blowing off the roof,"" Tener said of the main concerns for any home during a hurricane. ""You worry about the rain. And you worry about flooding.""

Anchored deep into the ground, the home also includes flood vents to relieve water pressure and protect the foundation. With these features, the house is rated to withstand 190-mile-per-hour winds — a very strong Category 5 hurricane.

""The inspector, when he came and inspected, he says, 'If we have a hurricane, I'm coming here,'"" Tener said.

A different kind of builder

Tener's home was built by Deltec Homes, a family-run company based in Asheville, North Carolina. The company has built more than 5,000 homes around the world, many designed specifically for resilience in extreme weather.

""We're taking that great shape and we're pairing it with amazing materials,"" said Matt Oblinsky, Deltec's lead engineer. The company estimates its homes cost about 10% more than traditional construction, but they often fare far better in storms. ""We're 99% successful,"" Oblinsky said of the homes' performance in past hurricanes. But he adds a note of caution: ""There's no such thing as a hurricane-proof home. We're very careful to say these are hurricane-resistant.""

Testing the limits

At the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in South Carolina, engineers are working to make both new and existing homes more resilient. Using a massive wall of over 100 fans, the institute can simulate a Category 3 hurricane to test how well homes hold up under intense conditions.

In essence, IBHS builds homes and then destroys them.

And we do it all in the name of science,"" said Sarah Dillingham, senior meteorologist at IBHS.

The tests often reveal the vulnerabilities that can lead to catastrophic damage.

""Your roof is your first line of defense,"" Dillingham said. ""And it is what helps hold everything together in your home.""

She recommends storm-ready upgrades like high-impact windows, reinforced doors, and — crucially — wind-rated garage doors. ""Your garage door is your biggest opening of your home,"" she said. ""Because when wind gets in, it will find the weakest link.""

Longterm savings

For Tener, investing in a storm-resilient home has paid off financially as well. He even canceled his optional flood insurance saving him $12,000 per year.

""You put a little more money into it and it lasts forever,"" he said. ""It pays off in the long run.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/08/dc5b9fb7-3111-4ba3-b18a-4e8715751b4a/thumbnail/1200x630/d9e98a4e0dc4cfc3bf7cc663eadc7c60/f5-hurricane-homes-transfer-frame-2013.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 00:01:23.543838

The up to 11 gigawatt (GW) facility in Amarillo powered by nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy, is planned near the Department of Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons plant and in partnership with Texas Tech University.

Fermi said in its application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the regulator made public on July 8, that it is engaging in talks with many Big Tech companies, known as ""hyperscalers,"" on letters of intent and term sheets, or preliminary documents that are usually non-binding.

The application said that the hyperscalers would be tenants, apparently meaning they would not own part of the plants. Fermi did not immediately answer questions about financial arrangements being discussed with Big Tech companies or which or how many hyperscalers it is in talks with.

The last two reactors built in the U.S. were AP1000, completed in Vogtle, Georgia. They cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Those plants were delayed by years and came in billions of dollars above projected costs. But nuclear backers say lessons learned should cut construction time and final costs of the next AP1000 reactors.

Fermi said in the application that the nuclear complex, which it calls the Donald J. Trump Generating Plant, will be eligible for financing from the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office. The only time the president tapped the LPO in his first term was for the Vogtle plants.

The company said other plans to finance construction and operation include equity capital contributions from institutional infrastructure and real estate investors, structured bond offerings, and clean energy tax credits.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing.
“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT.
Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars.
The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars.","A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that battery electric cars sold today in Europe emit nearly 4 times less greenhouse gases over their lifetime than gasoline cars.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing. According to new ICCT research, battery electric cars sold today produce 73% less life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than their gasoline counterparts — even when factoring in production. That’s a 24% improvement over our 2021 estimates. In contrast, other powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, show only marginal or no progress in reducing their climate impacts.

The study, a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of all major powertrain types, reinforces earlier findings: only battery electric cars can deliver the large-scale emission cuts needed to address Europe’s most polluting transport mode. Passenger cars account for nearly three-quarters of the sector’s emissions.

“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT. “This progress is largely due to the fast deployment of renewable electricity across the continent and the greater energy efficiency of battery electric cars.”

By 2025, renewable energy sources are expected to account for 56% of electricity generation in Europe, an 18-point increase compared with 2020. The EU’s Joint Research Centre projects this share will increase further in the next decade, to 86% by 2045. Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars. In contrast, the fuels mix used by internal combustion engine cars will continue to mainly rely on fossil fuels, as the availability and price of alternative fuels remains uncertain.

Other technologies continue to lag behind battery electric vehicles in terms of life-cycle emission reductions. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars offer only 20% and 30% lower lifetime emissions than gasoline, respectively. This is also because plug-in hybrids are found to be driven less on electricity than previously assumed. While hybridization offers some benefits, these reductions are relatively small when compared with the emissions savings of battery electric cars—and they are not sufficient to meet the long-term climate targets.

The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. This pathway can also offer significant emissions reduction (79%) compared with gasoline cars—but only when using renewable electricity-based hydrogen, which is currently not produced and available at scale in Europe. In contrast, fuel cell electric cars run on hydrogen produced from natural gas, which corresponds to almost the entirety of hydrogen available today, allowing only a 26% reduction of life-cycle emissions compared with gasoline cars.

Addressing misuse of data in the EV debate

Misinformation and selective use of data have generated confusion regarding the climate credentials of electric vehicles. The ICCT analysis provides transparency on the impact of a selection of flawed assumptions, such as not accounting for the development of the grid during the lifetime of vehicles and using non-representative data on vehicle fuel consumption and lifetime.

One common claim is that electric vehicles have higher emissions associated with battery manufacturing. While manufacturing emissions for battery electric cars are roughly 40% higher than for gasoline cars, the ICCT’s research shows that this initial “emissions debt” is typically offset after around 17,000 kilometers of driving, usually within the first one to two years of use in Europe.

“We hope this study brings clarity to the public conversation, so that policymakers and industry leaders can make informed decisions,” said Dr. Georg Bieker, ICCT Senior Researcher. “We’ve recently seen auto industry leaders misrepresenting the emissions math on hybrids. But life-cycle analysis is not a choose-your-own-adventure exercise. Our study accounts for the most representative use cases and is grounded in real-world data. Consumers deserve accurate, science-backed information.”

The ICCT analysis covers the greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle and battery production and recycling, fuel and electricity production, fuel consumption, and maintenance. Its methodology also accounts for the development of the electricity mix along the lifetime of vehicles, as well as real-world usage rather than official test values to estimate fuel and electricity consumption, which is key to assessing plug-in hybrid emissions.

Solar Stocks Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.","Solar stocks retreated Tuesday after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday ending subsidies for green energy sources. The Department of Energy released a corresponding report the same day warning of a major spike in blackouts by 2030 due to the retirement of coal-fired plants.

The White House on Monday released the new executive order that eliminates subsidies for ""unreliable"" green energy sources, like wind and solar. The order claims that such projects displace ""affordable, reliable"" dispatchable domestic energy sources, which ""compromises our electric grid."" Dispatchable energy sources include conventional energy sources like fossil fuels. President Trump's announcement claims that reliance on green subsidies threatens national security by making the U.S. dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.

Energy Executive Order

""Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation,"" the order reads.

The executive order aims to eliminate taxpayer-funded green energy as well as support for green energy sources and supply chains built in or controlled by ""foreign adversaries."" The EO also builds on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by strengthening repeals and modifications to wind, solar and green energy tax cuts.

The Secretary Of Treasury has been ordered to within 45 days terminate clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities as part of the Internal Revenue Code. There are some additional ""beginning of construction"" revisions, including restricting safe harbor provisions unless a ""substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

During that time period, the Department of the Interior will determine if wind and solar facilities have been given any preferential treatment compared to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior will then revise any regulations or policies to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar.

The Treasury and Interior departments will submit their findings to the president after the 45 day period in order to plan for the next steps.

Need For New Energy

Meanwhile, the Department of Energy released a report on Monday warning that blackouts in the U.S. could increase 100x by 2030 ""if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity."" Firm capacity refers to natural gas plants, coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants, which do not rely on variable sources like wind and sunlight.

The department warned that the status quo is ""unsustainable"" with growing electricity demand from AI and data centers. The U.S. currently plans for 104 gigawatts (GW) of power generation plant retirements, to be replaced by 209 GW of new energy generation by 2030. But only 22 of those new GW come from what the DOE deems firm generation sources.

The DOE wrote this could lead to significant outages when weather conditions do not accommodate wind and solar generation. Wind and solar facilities increasingly use batteries and other energy storage strategies in order to save their generated power supply and extend availability.

The DOE's model predicts annual outage hours could increase from ""single digits today to more than 800 hours per year."" Even without retirements, the model found outage risks in ""several regions"" would rise more than 30-fold during the forecast period, meaning ""the queue alone cannot close the dependable-capacity deficit.""

Solar Stocks

Morgan Stanley in a Tuesday research note wrote that energy companies AES (AES) and NextEra Energy (NEE) may be the most affected by the executive order, The Fly reported. The firm noted that the EO directs agencies to adjust construction guidelines for tax credit eligibility, implement FEOC restrictions and remove preferential policies for renewables from the Department of Interior. The order targets clean tech, solar stocks and other renewable developers the most, primarily AES and NextEra. It looks ""less meaningful"" for the likes of GE Vernova (GEV), Bloom Energy (BE), Plug Power (PLUG), First Solar (FSLR) and Fluence Energy (FLNC).

RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker noted that the plan to curtail renewables does not come as a surprise following commentary from members of the House Freedom Caucus last week, according to The Fly. Tucker expects more pressure on the sector as the order leaves the solar industry in another state of limbo while awaiting the Treasury interpretation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how the Trump administration plans to redefine the ""beginning of construction.""

Solar Stocks

Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.

AES stock fell nearly 4%. First Solar and Array Technologies (ARRY) both tumbled almost 7%.

NextEra slid 3%.

SolarEdge (SEDG) pared its Tuesday declines to around 1%, while GE Vernova eased slightly.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.
More stories about chemical recycling","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn rules first proposed by the Biden administration that addressed chemical recycling and had attracted significant industry opposition.

In a document set to publish July 9, the current Trump administration-led EPA said it is withdrawing “significant new use rules,” or SNURs, proposed in June 2023 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). These rules would have required companies that intend to “process any of 18 specific chemical substances derived from plastic waste for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity” to allow the agency to assess risks and regulate the significant new use if needed.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

During the extended public comment period for the 2023 proposal, chemical recycling firm Brightmark suggested additional time for stakeholders to consider “a number of key terms and potential effects of the proposed rule which would merit additional clarification.”

In its comments at the time, Freepoint Eco-Systems, which has been involved in several chemical recycling projects, said the rules put undue administrative burdens on industry, and asserted there were inconsistencies between the policy and the EPA’s mission, including that:

Imposing regulatory obstacles for realistic recycling scenarios runs counter to EPA’s stated objective of developing a circular economy for plastics.

Focusing on feedstock purity deviates from EPA’s approach to regulating chemicals under TSCA.

Michigan-based Dow cited in its comments the lack of a de minimis level for impurities, which “makes analytical testing and quantification impractical.” The company recommended EPA specify the chemicals of concern and identify a content threshold, among other suggestions for increasing clarity.

Ironically, the 2023 proposal purported to be addressing a lack of clarity surrounding pyrolysis, the most common method of chemical recycling: “As a result of recent market trends, especially with respect to the increased processing of waste plastics, the EPA received several inquiries about OSWI (other solid waste incineration) units and the applicability of OSWI regulations to pyrolysis/combustion units for a variety of process and feedstock type,” the proposal stated. “Based on these requests and the absence of a statutory definition of pyrolysis in the CAA (Clean Air Act), the Agency believed that there was considerable confusion in the regulated community regarding the applicability of OSWI to pyrolysis/combustion units. Moreover, the term ‘pyrolysis/combustion’ is not defined in the current OSWI regulation, nor is it included in the definition of ‘Institutional waste incineration unit.'”

In comparison, no official company comments were submitted during the public comment period for a 2020 proposal from the Trump EPA that, among other issues, sought to remove the reference to “pyrolysis/combustion units” from the OSWI definition of ‘‘municipal waste combustion unit.” However, the agency “received significant adverse comments on that revision,” largely from environmental and tribal groups, the agency said in its own withdrawal in 2023.

Plastics makers applaud withdrawal

In a statement, Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, said the rules “imposed unnecessary burdens and hindered investments in the advanced recycling industry.”

Eisenberg went on to say the SNURs lacked the required scientific basis required under TSCA, exceeded EPA’s authority by attempting to regulate feedstock impurities, and “failed to recognize the thermal and chemical transformation processes — such as pyrolysis — that can remove these impurities during the advanced recycling process.”

In a February 2025 blog post, Eisenberg lauded the first Trump administration for its “great progress on updating and clarifying federal policy to treat the re-manufacture of plastic (and other materials) like similar manufacturing processes.” He urged the current EPA to re-introduce its proposed regulations from 2020, adding that “companies need regulatory certainty if they’re going to invest in technologies and facilities designed to last for decades” and “there are few more surefire paths to stifle innovation than ambiguous regulations.”

Recycling industry stakeholders have expressed similar concerns about inconsistency and uncertainty in how chemical recycling will be handled amid federal administration changes and state-level initiatives that are creating a patchwork of regulations.

For example, as California works to finalize regulations for its extended producer responsibility law for packaging, proposed procedures for handling new and emerging technologies — including chemical recycling — have drawn debate, especially from environmental groups. One recent draft placed the responsibility on the requesting facility to prove a new technology meets state requirements.

Recycling stakeholders in both Europe and the U.S. have struggled to advance chemical recycling projects, citing legislative hurdles along with high capital expenditures among the headwinds they face.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.","The renewable energy industry faces a new series of hurdles after President Donald Trump signed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ into law on July 4. The law quickly phases out tax incentives for wind and solar power, which some experts warn could lead to project cancellations, job losses and higher electricity prices as well as power shortages.

The changes are a significant shift in policy as the Trump administration looks to end taxpayer support for renewable energy. In the lead-up to the bill’s passage, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called incentives for wind and solar “wasteful and counterproductive.”

“The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand,” Wright wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Wright referenced a January winter storm in which the mid-Atlantic’s regional grid received only 4% of its power from renewables when electricity demand was high.

Opponents of the policy change, however, argue that it will slow renewable energy development at a time when the U.S. grid needs additional power generation to feed power-hungry data centers. In addition to causing project cancellations and job losses, renewable energy groups and industry analysts argue the new deadlines will limit new supply, forcing prices up and making the grid less reliable, especially during hot summers.

“This bill on the whole is negative for energy development in the United States, for manufacturing, and for just everyday families and consumers,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director focused on federal policy at the advocacy group Advanced Energy United.

How did the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ change renewable energy incentives?

The tax credits allow companies to earn a small reward — typically less than 1 cent per kilowatt-hour — for power generated by renewable energy sources. Once a new wind or solar installation begins providing electricity to the grid, the companies can claim the tax credits for the next 10 years.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, companies that began construction by 2033 would qualify for 10 years of credits once they started operating. The new law shortens the deadline and adds a requirement for the project to begin providing power to the grid. Now, projects that begin construction within the next 12 months have until 2030 to begin operations. Any projects that start construction after July 4, 2026, or those already under construction, need to be operational by the end of 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

How will the deadlines affect renewable energy?

Godfrey said project development usually takes two to four years before construction of new wind or solar projects begin. In that time, projects can be held up by local or federal permitting processes and lawsuits.

As a result, Godfrey said there are projects “in active development right now that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year.” The new deadlines threaten to “cut those projects off at the knees,” he said.

Construction can take as little as six months for some solar projects or several years for large offshore wind, Godfrey said. Even once construction is finished, Godfrey added that projects must be connected to the grid before being deemed truly operational. That lengthy process, called interconnection, is controlled not by the renewable energy companies but by regional grid operators.

“The vast majority of these project developers are looking to outside capital in order to go about financing their projects,” Godfrey said. Without certainty that the projects will qualify for tax credits, he expects a significant number of financers will pull out of projects already underway.

Will the grid become less reliable?

Michael Keyser is the CEO of the National Renewables Cooperative Organization, where he helps local electric cooperatives around the country adopt renewable energy and other emerging technologies. In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Keyser said he is skeptical about dire predictions of cost increases and grid reliability issues.

While he acknowledged that some ongoing projects may not qualify for tax credits, he said that changing the long-term incentives away from wind and solar is a “shift that we needed.”

The Big Beautiful Bill keeps the window to qualify for tax credits open longer for clean energy sources like nuclear, hydropower, geothermal and batteries, which are not dependent on weather conditions. Keyser said electric co-ops are increasingly leaning toward these technologies — especially batteries — and other “dispatchable” resources that provide power to the grid whenever it’s needed.

“It’s time for [wind and solar] to stand on their own two feet,” Keyser said.

Doug Lewin, an energy expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power Newsletter, agreed that the grid needs clean dispatchable power, but he sees a danger in “hamstringing” renewables.

In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Lewin noted that dispatchable technologies, such as natural gas and nuclear, have even longer planning and construction timelines than wind and solar. In the immediate future, the grid needs more power, and solar is the fastest-growing energy source.

The new law, Lewin said, lacks “any sort of logical, sensible vision for how we’re going to grow power.”

Another source of uncertainty for renewable energy comes from the “foreign entities of concern” rule, a part of the law that places limits on the number of components companies can source from China, Russia, Iran and a few other nations. The exact guidelines have not yet been written, but on Monday, July 7, President Trump issued an executive order, giving the Treasury Department 45 days to finalize a rule.

Lewin said the policies amount to “choking out supply,” which he said could have dire consequences. “

“Higher prices and a whole lot more conservation alerts, energy emergencies, and the occasional rolling outage. That’s what we’re looking at over the next few years,” he said.

WITH THE SWEEP OF A PEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY ON NOTICE.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.

AND A NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER DEMANDS AGENCIES “RAPIDLY ELIMINATE THE MARKET DISTORTIONS,” TRUMP SAYS THESE SUBSIDIES CAUSE.

ENERGY SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT HAS CALLED THESE TAXPAYER INCENTIVES “WASTEFUL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.”

BUT THOSE FOR INCENTIVES SAY THE START AND STOP FOR THE INDUSTRY IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, TOO.

BACK IN 2022, LAWMAKERS EXTENDED THE DECADES-OLD SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR AND WIND WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT.

UNDER THAT LAW, ENERGY COMPANIES HAD THROUGH 2032 TO START CONSTRUCTION TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES. ONCE A QUALIFIED SOLAR OR WIND FARM WAS GENERATING POWER, THE COMPANY COULD CLAIM A TAX CREDIT ON THAT RENEWABLE POWER FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,” NOW LAW, SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENS THAT TIME FRAME.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT BEGIN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS HAVE UNTIL 2030 TO GET ONLINE.

EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE GENERATING POWER BY THE END OF 2027 TO CASH IN.

ADVANCED ENERGY UNITED’S HARRY GODFREY SAYS THE TIMELINE WILL PUT SOME PROJECTS IN A TOUGH SPOT. THAT’S BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS OF PLANNING BEFORE CONSTRUCTION EVEN STARTS.

“You could have projects that are in active development right now, that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year,” said Godfrey. “The passage and enactment of this law did mean that those projects got cut off at the knees.”

BUT MICHAEL KEYSER FROM THE NATIONAL RENEWABLES COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION SAYS SOLAR AND WIND HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH HELP FROM TAXPAYERS.

“These technologies have had 20 years’ worth of subsidies and it’s time for them to stand on their own two feet if they’re going to exist,” he said.

KEYSER SAYS HE’D PREFER TO SEE FEDERAL INVESTMENT SHIFT TO POWER SOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AROUND THE CLOCK.

In 1977, President Carter issued an Executive Order4 (Carter EO) directing CEQ to “[i]ssue regulations to Federal agencies for the implementation of the procedural provisions of [NEPA]” and stipulated some of the requirements to be incorporated therein. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued EO 141545 rescinding the Carter EO and directing CEQ “to issue guidance on implementing NEPA and to propose rescinding the NEPA implementing regulations.”6 At this direction, CEQ rescinded its regulations implementing NEPA, concluding that “it may lack authority to issue binding rules on agencies in the absence of the now-rescinded” Carter EO.7

Grid Faces Urgent Reliability Challenges Amid AI-Driven Load Growth and Plant Retirements","A new report by the U.S. Department of Energy provides a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy and reliability of the U.S. electric grid and warns that without urgent reforms and investment, the U.S. electric grid will be unable to support the nation’s economic ambitions, particularly in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and digital infrastructure. The report responds to recent executive orders emphasizing the need for a uniform, data-driven approach to evaluating grid reliability, particularly in the face of accelerating power plant retirements and surging electricity demand from data centers and AI applications.

Key findings include:

Grid Reliability at a Crossroads: The report finds that the current trajectory of plant retirements, coupled with insufficient additions of firm, dispatchable generation, places the S. grid at significant risk of widespread outages by 2030. This risk is compounded by rapid load growth, especially from data centers supporting AI and digital infrastructure.

AI and Data Center Load Growth: Electricity demand from data centers represents a major new source of load. This growth is concentrated in key regions such as PJM, ERCOT, and the West and cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.

Retirements Outpacing Reliable Additions: By 2030, 104 GW of generation (primarily coal and natural gas power plants) is slated for retirement, while only 22 GW of new firm baseload generation is expected to be added. The majority of new generation will come from intermittent sources (solar and wind), which do not provide the same reliability benefits as traditional baseload plants.

Risk of Outages Increases Dramatically: Under a scenario where all announced retirements occur, the report projects a 100-fold increase in annual hours of lost load, with some regions facing the possibility of losing up to 43% of hourly load during extreme events. Even if retirements are avoided, reliability risks remain elevated in several regions.

Regional Vulnerabilities: The analysis highlights that PJM, SPP, ERCOT, and SERC are particularly exposed to reliability shortfalls, especially during winter peaks. In contrast, regions such as ISO-NE and NYISO, which are not projected to see significant AI/data center load growth, remain relatively robust.

Modernization and Data Sharing Needed: The report underscores the inadequacy of traditional resource adequacy metrics and calls for modernized, granular approaches that account for the frequency, magnitude, and duration of outages. Enhanced regional collaboration and data exchange are identified as critical to effective grid planning and risk mitigation.

Solar power is reaching ever higher shares in some of the world’s largest power systems, but batteries promise to take this to the next level. Advances in technology and price reductions for both batteries and solar mean that solar power is no longer constrained to the daytime, but can deliver power 24 hours a day across the whole year. One of my favourite pieces published in June was an investigation into how 24/365 solar can already be a reality with today’s technology.

Ember also reported on the need for more ambitious grid planning if countries in Europe want to compete in the growing race for AI data centers – a topical issue right now. Another favourite June report described how electrification — the process of moving from fossil fuels to electricity — can fundamentally change the game and move us faster towards a clean energy future. It’s a brilliant read!

My pick for June’s chart of the month is taken from our analysis of the EU’s final National Energy and Climate Plans. One of Ember’s data viz experts, Reynaldo Dizon, took inspiration from the circular layout of the EU Council’s meeting room in Brussels and its vibrant carpet (designed to give equal visual weight to all 27 Member States) to provide a fitting visual metaphor presenting national target data on common ground.

The graphic reveals that most EU countries still lack adequate or complete data for critical aspects of the energy transition. Many targets are missing entirely or rely on outdated scenarios, limiting the EU’s ability to coordinate effectively and deliver on its climate goals.

You can see more of Ember’s best graphics from June in Datawrapper’s recent Data Viz Dispatch blog, which showcases some of the best data visualizations produced by newsrooms and other organisations from around the world.

China reached a major milestone in April with more than a quarter of its electricity coming from wind and solar – a level that was maintained in May, according to the latest data. China installed 93 GW of solar in May, which is roughly equivalent to the total solar capacity that Germany — the world’s sixth largest solar generator — has ever installed.

So far this year, China’s increase in clean power has been large enough to meet and exceed demand growth, resulting in a fall in fossil generation of 2.6% in January to May compared to the same period in 2024.

Scientists are worried what comes next,"Andrew Freedman, Ella Nilsen",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/climate/doe-climate-contrarians-trump,"The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.
He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.
CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE.
Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.
“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN.","The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. Each were given positions in the Energy Department, which is led by Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas fracking executive.

The researchers are John Christy and Roy Spencer, both of whom are research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.

Koonin previously served at DOE during the Obama administration, and earlier was a scientist for the oil and gas giant BP. He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.

The hirings were first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by CNN.

In the Energy Department’s internal employee directory, Koonin is listed as a “special government employee,” Christy is listed as “expert” and Spencer a “consultant,” according to an agency source familiar with the matter. All three are listed as being under the office of Energy Secretary Wright, the source confirmed.

The Energy Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the hires of the three men, as well as questions on what they were working on at DOE and how long they would be there.

CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE. Christy told CNN in an emailed response that he was not on the Energy Department’s payroll and was “just here to help as needed.”

Koonin, a theoretical physicist, served as the undersecretary for science at DOE under the Obama administration. He is the author of the 2021 book, “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters.”

The Trump administration is currently working on overturning a 2009 federal scientific finding that planet-warming pollution poses a threat to public welfare, which underpins many regulations designed to curb the nation’s pollution. That effort is being led by the Environmental Protection Agency, but is likely to involve other agencies, including the Department of Energy.

In addition, the second Trump administration has taken a hatchet to public spending on climate science research, proposing to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s research activities altogether while making cuts at other agencies as well.

The Energy Department employs numerous climate scientists and houses some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, which are used in part for modeling future global warming and its impacts.

Christy and Spencer have long maintained that satellite data does not show the same trends and extent of global warming as surface weather data and have used that to poke holes in the mainstream scientific data.

The Trump administration recently let go of hundreds of scientists who were beginning to work on the next iteration of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, which includes input from all climate-related federal agencies.

In recent weeks, the administration took down past iterations of these climate assessments, which are the most authoritative reports on how climate change will affect the US. It also shut down the educational website, climate.gov, and laid off its staff.

While the scope of their work is currently unclear, some prominent climate scientists are concerned Christy, Spencer and Koonin will be working on an alternative version of the next National Climate Assessment, which would be far more slanted to fringe views on the causes and consequences of global warming.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, told CNN the hires signal an effort by DOE to arrive at a predetermined result.

“Hiring Koonin, Spencer, and Christy is not just irregular, it’s a recognition that none of the normal channels would not give them the answer they want,” Dessler said. “This seems to be a thread running through this administration. They don’t seek out legitimate expert opinion; instead, they find people to give them the answer they want.”

Christy suggested in his email to CNN that he wasn’t involved with either the national climate assessment or efforts to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding.

“I don’t know what is happening with the National Climate Assessment or the Endangerment Finding,” he wrote.

Dessler noted that Koonin, Christy and Spencer are well-known for making value judgements in their supposedly scientific assessments as well as cherry picking data, and the language they use tends to be in the personal-opinion space, rather than the science space.

“There’s also a lot of ‘I’m not convinced’ on areas that everyone else in the field is convinced by (‘I’m not convinced climate models are any good’). That’s not really a scientific argument,” Dessler said.

Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.

“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN. “While it’s useful to assess a variety of views, specifically seeking out and elevating fringe views that are not supported by the vast majority of the scientific research on a subject is deeply problematic.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20250708-koonin-christy-spencer.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-07-08 19:15:21.015247

July 8 (Reuters) – U.S. power consumption will hit record highs in 2025 and 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its short-term energy outlook on Tuesday.

The EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,189 billion kilowatt hours in 2025 and 4,278 billion kWh in 2026, up from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024.

Those demand increases come in part from data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, and as homes and businesses use more electricity and less fossil fuels for heat and transportation.

The EIA forecast 2025 power sales will rise to 1,517 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,474 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,052 billion kWh for industrial customers.

Those forecasts compare to all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,434 billion kWh in 2024 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

The EIA said natural gas’ share of power generation would slide from 42% in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026. Coal’s share will rise from 16% in 2024 to 17% in 2025 before sliding to 15% in 2026 as renewable output rises.

The percentage of renewable generation will rise from 23% in 2024 to 25% in 2025 and 26% in 2026, while nuclear power’s share will slide from 19% in 2024 to 18% in 2025 and 2026, according to the outlook.

The EIA projected gas sales in 2025 would rise to 13.1 billion cubic feet per day for residential consumers, 9.8 bcfd for commercial customers and 23.5 bcfd for industrial customers, but fall to 35.8 bcfd for power generation.

That compares with all-time highs of 14.3 bcfd in 1996 for residential consumers, 9.6 bcfd in 2019 for commercial customers, 23.8 bcfd in 1973 for industrial customers and 36.9 bcfd in 2024 for power generation.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects.
But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.
The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.
The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago.","President Donald Trump is wasting no time hastening the demise of green energy tax credits — in keeping with the big, beautiful bargain he made with conservative Republicans.

The deal with Republican holdouts to end incentives for wind and solar power paved the way for passage of Trump’s mega-tax-and-spending bill. Trump’s July 4 signature on the bill completed the legislative assault on the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidies for renewable energy.

But just how quickly the White House turned a handshake deal with House hard-liners into a presidential order — almost overnight — is notable, Christa Marshall reports.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects. It directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to look for ways in which wind and solar are getting preferential treatment. And it gives Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 45 days to implement provisions in the law aimed at preventing projects from partnering with “foreign entities of concern.”

That means primarily China, the globe’s dominant source of solar and battery technology.

The deadlines are tight. Wind and solar projects receive tax credits as long as they start construction by mid-2026, while projects that start later would need to be placed into service by 2027. In comparison, nuclear and geothermal resources have until 2033 to obtain tax credits.

Promises made, promises kept

Trump’s eagerness to make good on his promise to Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other budget hawks fits neatly with his disdain for Biden-era climate policy. Trump has rebuked the previous administration’s goal of shutting down coal plants in favor of carbon-free wind and solar generation, which he recently called “windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK.’”

Monday’s order to Treasury and Interior is also striking for another reason: The famously transactional president isn’t always known for holding his ground on big policy announcements.

Wall Street investors started using the term TACO (“Trump Always Chickens Out”) after Trump repeatedly backed away from threats and deadlines for slapping high tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The president is walking back a pause on the delivery of U.S. weapons to Ukraine in the war against Russia.

And last month’s bombing of Iran — raising the possibility of deeper U.S. involvement in a Middle East war — came despite the president’s boasts of keeping Americans out of foreign entanglements.

After last weekend’s tragic rains and floods in Texas, which took the lives of more than 100 people, including 27 kids at a Christian summer camp for girls, the seriousness of the administration’s on-again, off-again talk of abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency faces a real-world test, as do Trump’s cuts at the National Weather Service.

But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.

Supreme Court says Trump can order mass firings

The Supreme Court gave Trump the go-ahead today to launch his plan to fire thousands of federal workers, write Josh Gerstein and Hassan Ali Kanu.

The high court’s unsigned order grants the administration’s emergency appeal to enforce a February executive order that instructed agencies to carry out “reductions in force.” The justices said they were not assessing the legality of agency layoff plans, and litigation over the downsizing efforts is sure to continue.

The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.

Help wanted

The National Weather Service still hasn’t posted job ads for vacant positions in depleted forecast offices around the country, Daniel Cusick writes.

The agency has lost nearly 600 employees in recent months, as the administration fired probationary employees and made early retirement or buyout offers. Those vacancies are now in the spotlight after catastrophic floods in Texas killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children.

The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago. A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, said the process to post job ads “is currently underway.”

Meanwhile, experts are warning that Trump’s upcoming cuts to weather and disaster spending — including warning systems and flood projects — could mean new risks for areas around the country, write Scott Waldman and Chelsea Harvey.

“Lives are going to be lost, property is going to be damaged,” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under former President Joe Biden.

Emergency coal for AI?

The Department of Energy released a report Monday that lays the groundwork for keeping open coal and gas plants slated for closure, Peter Behr writes.

The analysis details the worst-case scenarios if the energy needs of artificial intelligence expand beyond the grid’s capacity — including weeks of power outages in some states by 2030. The report is widely seen as setting the stage for Trump to use an emergency provision of the Federal Power Act, written for wartime use, to order fossil fuel plants to keep running.

“Absent intervention, it is impossible for the nation’s bulk power system to meet the AI growth requirements while maintaining a reliable power grid and keeping energy costs low for our citizens,” said the report.

It could mark a serious win for the automaker, as it prepares to launch multiple next-generation affordable EVs, developed by its ""skunkworks"" teams.

The LFP supply chain has long been dominated by China. But American manufacturing of automotive-grade LFP cells marks a pivotal moment for the industry.

Ford’s upcoming electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan should still qualify for production credits under the Trump administration’s newly enacted legislation, the automaker said on Tuesday. If that happens, it could mark a major win and a turning point for the Dearborn automaker’s EV plans. The federal funding could help offset manufacturing costs for Ford’s next-generation affordable EVs.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford said in a statement. “The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit—a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness,” the automaker added. Reuters reported the news first.

The $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is already 60% complete and slated to begin producing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries next year. These batteries, which are cheaper and more durable than traditional lithium-ion packs (but less power-dense), will power Ford’s upcoming affordable EVs. The Marshall, Michigan, facility is the first in the U.S. to make automotive LFP batteries.

The LFP supply chain has for years been dominated by China. But LFP tech is now going global. Auto executives increasingly see it as key to making affordable, mass-market EVs.

""This is an opportunity for Ford to lead in this space and bring the technology back to the U.S.,"" Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, told InsideEVs in an interview in June during a tour of the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan.

The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” now signed into law, dramatically undercuts federal support for clean energy. The clean vehicle tax credit is being phased out far earlier than expected, fuel economy rules have been rolled back and the Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to loosen its Multi Pollutant Emissions Criteria—again.

Still, incentives for domestic battery manufacturing remain intact, at least in some capacity. The rules are now stricter, requiring a higher share of raw materials to be sourced from within the U.S. But projects that were already under construction by the end of 2024, such as Ford’s LFP plant, are not affected under Section 45X of the advanced manufacturing credit, and therefore do not need to meet the tougher requirements.

Ford broke ground on the LFP plant back in 2023 and seems relatively shielded from the new restrictions under the newly passed spending bill. That's a relief for the company, as the plant has drawn scrutiny from Republican lawmakers over Ford’s licensing agreement with Chinese battery giant CATL, which some have alleged has ties to forced labor over in China.

But the automaker said the plant is key to bringing affordable EVs to the masses and to bring back LFP tech—which was invented at the University of Texas at Austin—to the U.S. It will support 1,700 manufacturing jobs when complete.

Plus, Ford has long maintained that the new battery plant is “Ford-owned” and “Ford-operated.” The CATL collaboration is merely a “legal fact” because of who owns the patents and the licensing deal which will allow for the technology to truly proliferate in the U.S.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKqbWE/s1/ford-blueoval-battery-park-michigan.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:13:37.026455

In the Chicago area and around the country, dealership owners are preparing for the cuts to go into effect in just a couple of months. The owners said they are already seeing changes in the market.

The federal tax credits, which are meant to get drivers behind the wheel of electric cars, end Sept. 30. The credits cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new electric car, and up to $4,000 off to a used car.

""The $7,500 incentive is fully 20% the price of this vehicle,"" said John Crane, who runs Hawk Auto Group, as he pointed out a Fiat 500E for sale on one of his lots.

The end of the federal tax credits for electric car purchases is a consequence of the massive tax and spending cut bill passed last week. Crane said the electric vehicles currently in stock will sell out, and then dealerships after that will only get supply to the tune of a handful a month.

""We're not going to order as many as we currently have in stock,"" he said.

Crane added that a $7,500 credit going away also amounts to a cost of about $200 more a month for the average consumer.

He said the result of all this is sure to be that a lot of people just won't buy electric cars anymore.

""The barrier to entry is going to be higher, and less people will be willing to take a chance,"" he said.

Hawk Auto Group, which has dealerships across Illinois, said the end of the tax credit will mean changes for them too.

""The $7,500 credit is beyond the scope of what a dealership could afford to make up,"" Crane said.

Meanwhile, the change is already making waves in the auto industry — to the point where some manufacturers aren't making as many electric cars.

""Nissan has pushed out production for some of their electric vehicles,"" Crane said, ""and you know, even at the high end, Maserati was planning on going all-electric, and now they're not going to do that at all.""

It is not just a couple of automakers reassessing plans for electric vehicles.

""Nearly all automakers have reassessed their product portfolio and are pushing their new entrants into electric vehicle segments further out, so they have more time to adjust what the real market is going to end up being without the incentive,"" said Crane.

John Truckenbrod is founder of Chicago-based EV Energy Group. He offered some perspective on the situation.

""Globally this year, one out of four cars sold will be electric,"" Truckenbrod said. ""Now, the United States isn't necessarily the leader in electric vehicles.""

The EV Energy Group installs different types of chargers — residential and commercial. He said the end to the tax credit may slow down electric vehicle purchases, but interest is not going anywhere.

""It will probably slow the market down, but it's not going to end the market,"" Truckenbrod said.

But what does the end to the tax credit mean for those who are shopping for a car. Regardless of whether interest is maintained, consumers may indeed see fewer all-electric vehicles on dealership lots.

""If price goes up, we expect sales to go down. It's very simple,"" said Crane. ""So that means we would have to stock a few less, and we'll probably be working more off an order-based system for electric vehicles in the future.""

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) CEO told InvestorNews host Tracy Hughes, ticking off a string of recent hires: an operations veteran, a Ph.D. process-chemistry lead “who joined the team in the last two weeks,” and a project manager “who actually built an SX plant, both heavy and light.” Those additions anchor a company that—by design—intends to become, as Ryan put it, “very much an American story.”

Ucore’s ambitions rest on RapidSX™, a proprietary separation technology that has already logged “over 5,000 hours” on a Kingston, Ontario, demo line and just received a show-of-faith from the Pentagon. In May, the U.S. Department of Defense expanded its Other Transaction Agreement, layering US$18.4 million atop a previous US$4 million allocation. Ryan called it “about C$38 million added to the mix,” money earmarked for an 80,800-square-foot Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana, slated to start shipping separated oxides in the first half of 2026.

Armed with that federal endorsement, Ucore moved quickly to thicken its own war chest. A June financing added C$15.5 million, lifting available funds to “over $50 million.” The timing, Ryan said, avoided “summer doldrums” and the market’s “China on-again, off-again” anxiety, positioning the company to pursue only “strategic equity” going forward.

Location is its own hedge. Alexandria sits inside a foreign-trade zone, giving the plant tariff insulation for concentrates shipped up the Mississippi, whether from “Brazil, Australia,” or elsewhere. “Critical rares are needed,” Ryan noted, adding that the Louisiana build-out will be modular, scalable, and buffered from Gulf hurricanes yet within “good freight in, good freight out” corridors.

Kingston remains the company’s laboratory—now doubled in size—where engineers are exploring “oddball” feedstocks such as samarium-rich concentrates banned from export by China.

Meanwhile, the visitor log hints at downstream traction: “twenty-nine visitors” in 2024, including potential offtake partners seeking REEs for magnets and “other uses” beyond motors.

Shareholders can expect, in the next quarter, an engineering schedule for Louisiana, specifics on South American and Australian supply agreements, and “three- and four-prong partnerships” linking feedstock, processing, alloying, and end users. Ryan’s view is blunt: “You don’t just (want to) have one-off transactional relationships (because they) don’t do a whole lot for building out the complete supply chain.”

Dive Brief:

Detroit has launched a drone inspection pilot program for city-owned buildings that can identify energy-saving improvements and optimize performance.

The drones capture visible and thermal imaging of the building; an AI platform developed by Lamarr.AI processes the images and building analytics to create 3D models and energy simulations that help city officials identify thermal inefficiencies, assess structural conditions and optimize potential upgrades.

A partnership among Lamarr.AI, Detroit-based technology incubator Michigan Central and startup venture platform Newlab, the pilot “is a prime example of how public-private collaboration can unlock innovative solutions for cities,” said Tim Slusser, Detroit’s chief mobility officer, in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Detroit, the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan Central and Newlab in 2022 launched the Advanced Aerial Innovation Region as a real-world testbed for next-generation drone technologies “to move drone technology from concept to city-scale deployment,” according to a press release.

The number of use cases for drones in city operations is “phenomenally high,” said Matt Whitaker, director of mobility innovation platforms at Michigan Central.

Detroit had already established a transportation innovation zone to streamline permitting for new mobility solutions such as drones, and Michigan Central helped the city get Federal Aviation Administration permissions to fly the drones, Whitaker said.

For this project, Lamarr.AI, working with aerial photographers FlyGuys and drone operations management system Airspace Link, deployed drones to identify thermal deficiencies such as insulation gaps and potential water infiltration in three municipal buildings. It used the data to create 3D models it paired with energy simulations to pinpoint targeted upgrades that could reduce the three buildings’ HVAC energy use by up to 22%, according to the press release.

The final reports give the city a tiered approach to retrofitting the buildings, such as targeted weatherization at the curtain wall, replacement of specific failing windows, continuous wall insulation and roof enhancements.

“We are helping the city of Detroit, through the Office of Sustainability specifically, to identify vulnerabilities for cost and climate challenges,” said Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakha. “Our AI analyzes and categorizes building deficiencies and uses simulation to clearly state the return on investment once we identify an anomaly or a deficiency.”

Rakha said the combination of drones and its AI platform is “20 times faster, five to 10 times more affordable and 50% more accurate than [assessing thermal deficiencies by] regular means — including using drones in general because drones can collect data but not analyze it.”

The company’s technology can scan “a huge number of buildings in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost because we’re using our own AI analytics,” Rakha said. “That makes scaling quite accessible.”

We have updated this article to correct an error in the quote from Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakhaabout of the speed of the process. He said it’s 10 times faster.

Let alone [we don’t know] how that extreme weather is going to change over the years due to climate change,” said Di Liberto.
Meteorologists warn that it is important to have an emergency kit in case of flash floods.","From Texas to North Carolina, scientists say flash floods are not only becoming more frequent but also growing in intensity.

As of Tuesday, the devastating flash flooding in Texas has claimed the lives of over 100 people. This comes not even ten months after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina.

According to the National Weather Service, flash floods are the nation's number one storm-related killer.

“During Helene, they talked a lot about it being a once-in-a-thousand-year event or more,” Carl Schreck, senior research scholar with NCSU and NC Institute for Climate Studies, told News 13.

According to Climate Central, rainfall rates today are now 15% higher than in 1970.

""That's not taking into account climate change, where these events are starting to happen more frequently,"" Schreck added. ""So, the same rainfall today will have more moisture to work with and cause more rain than it would have 50 or 100 years ago.""

Scientists say climate change is one of the main causes. They say that as the planet warms, storms get stronger and rain gets heavier.

“A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture in it,” said Tom Di Liberto with Climate Central.

Climate Central reported that for every one degree of warming, the air can hold four percent more moisture, leading to heavier downfalls. WLOS Chief Meteorologist Jason Boyer says the landscapes of certain areas can also play a role. He broke down the difference between the flooding in Texas and Hurricane Helene.

“With the rainfall here in Western North Carolina, we were able to push it down into several different river stems and flush it. Even though we had flash flooding, it could have been much worse. In Texas, they only had the Guadalupe and Colorado River,” Boyer said.

But it is not just the floodwaters that pose a threat; they can cause a chain reaction of landslides and erosion.

“I think it’s clearly shown over the past couple of years that we are clearly not prepared. Let alone [we don’t know] how that extreme weather is going to change over the years due to climate change,” said Di Liberto.

Scientists say that to better prepare, people must be educated on the dangers of living by a river and listen to warnings when they are presented.

Meteorologists warn that it is important to have an emergency kit in case of flash floods.

An emergency kit should be stocked with food for at least three days, prescription medication and important papers such as insurance, birth certificates and licenses.",https://wlos.com/resources/media2/16x9/8256/986/0x430/90/a2f168f1-5a01-4cab-afa9-61992a418272-AP25188632711290.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:15:25.744486

“In 2023, domestic power plants alone released 1.4 billion metric tons of [carbon],” according to Callie Sharp, an associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago.
“If EPA finalizes this repeal, people will die preventable deaths,” Bender said in her comments at the hearing.
Power plant cooperatives and advocates including the US Chamber of Commerce testified later in the day, reiterating calls for cheaper and more affordable energy through the repeal of “costly” regulations.
“The carbon rule would cause the retirement of the entire coal fleet,” Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of America’s Power, said in her testimony.","Clean air and climate advocates urged the Environmental Protection Agency in public testimony Tuesday to scrap a proposal that would repeal strong limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the coal-fired power sector.

Officials from the EPA hosted multiple sessions of public comment during the day on a proposed repeal of all power plant carbon limits under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the latest of which relied on carbon capture technology to drastically reduce planet-warming emissions.

The EPA plan marks a significant shift from the Biden administration, which finalized the current limits as an effort to reduce the climate and public health effects of air pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Citing the Biden-era rule as a burden on the development of domestic energy sources, the Trump administration’s proposal justifies the repeal by claiming that “fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

Advocates testifying at the Tuesday hearing lambasted that reasoning.

“In 2023, domestic power plants alone released 1.4 billion metric tons of [carbon],” according to Callie Sharp, an associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago. “This is more than the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of nearly every other nation on Earth, and is greater than the collective greenhouse gas emissions of over half of the world’s countries.”

Many of the speakers expressed disappointment that the hearing was only one day long, when the last power plant rules finalized under the Biden administration had such extensive comment opportunity. The agency set a 30-day deadline to submit comments on the rule by Aug. 8.

Laura Kate Bender, vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association and a hearing speaker, said in an email that the EPA staff were “as engaged as ever in listening to testimony,” but also echoed concerns about the single-day schedule.

“If EPA finalizes this repeal, people will die preventable deaths,” Bender said in her comments at the hearing.

Extending the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit: The bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years, through 2029 (prior to enactment, these credits would expire in 2027).
[1] There are similar restrictions applicable to the Section 45Q carbon capture credit and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit.","On July 4, President Trump signed H.R.1—the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” referred to as the OBBB—into law. This sweeping tax and policy law, enacted through the process of budget reconciliation requiring a simple majority vote by Congress, carries significant implications for environmental funding, clean energy development, and climate-related programs administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as the tax code. Much of the provisions affect programs and funding originally authorized under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which was former President Biden’s signature budget reconciliation bill. Below, we outline some of the key features of the OBBB environmental and energy provisions.

Environmental Provisions

In an effort to hit topline federal spending reductions, the OBBB includes funding cuts for environmental programs previously appropriated to the EPA. This includes rescinding unobligated balances for the following programs authorized under the IRA:

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction fund (rescind unobligated balance of the $27 billion appropriated for nonprofit organizations to use for direct and indirect investment in various qualified environmental projects);

Environmental and climate justice block grants (rescind unobligated balance of the $2.8 billion for grants related to environmental and climate justice activities);

Environmental product declarations (rescind unobligated balance of the $250 million to develop and implement a program to standardize and increase transparency regarding environmental product declarations for construction materials that include assessments of GHG usage);

Funding for implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020 (rescind unobligated balance of the $38.5 million appropriated to carry out AIM Act goal to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including competitive grants to shift to lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants);

Renewable fuels standards under Clean Air Act § 211(o) (rescind unobligated balance of the $15 million for test/protocol development with respect to environmental and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive, procedures for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of a fuel, and the impacts of transportation fuels); and

GHG corporate reporting (rescind unobligated balance of the $5 million for enhanced standardization and transparency of corporate climate action commitments and plans to reduce GHG emissions).

The OBBB includes other fee- and royalty-related provisions to enact policy changes that seek to reduce burdens with domestic energy development, including:

Delay in methane emissions fee: OBBB delays a fee imposed by the IRA on certain methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources for 10 years, to 2034. This fee applies to excess emissions as defined in the IRA from facilities subject to EPA’s subpart W reporting under the greenhouse gas reporting program, unless eligible for an exemption. Congress rescinded EPA’s 2024 rule implementing the methane emissions fee by a Congressional Review Act resolution signed by President Trump in March 2025.

Expedited National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) review: The OBBB creates a new White House Council on Environmental Quality program in which a sponsor of a project requiring environmental review under NEPA can obtain expedited review by paying an optional fee—125% of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement—to have the environmental assessment completed no later than 180 days after paying the fee and the environmental impact statement completed within a year of the date of publication of the notice of intent to prepare the environmental impact statement.

Tax Implications

The legislation has significant tax implications for industry sectors with environmental impacts. This includes:

Phasing out the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax credit: The Section 45X credit—which provides a tax credit for manufacturers of eligible components that are produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party—will terminate for wind components sold after 2027. The Section 45X credit applicable to other eligible components will be phased out in accordance with the original IRA phaseout schedule (with phaseout beginning in 2030), but the OBBB now imposes a commensurate phaseout schedule for the Section 45X credit applicable to critical minerals, which was previously excluded from any phaseout schedule under the IRA.

Phasing out the Section 45Y and Section 48E Clean Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits for Wind and Solar Projects: The Section 45Y and 48E credits—related to clean electricity production and investments, respectively—will terminate for qualifying wind and solar facilities that are not placed in service by the end of 2027, with the exception of projects that begin construction by July 4, 2026, (i.e., 12 months after the OBBB’s enactment). The termination cliff is not applicable to other technologies that are eligible for the Section 45Y credit or the Section 48E credit, such as qualifying energy storage technologies, which would remain subject to the original IRA phaseout schedule.

Implementing Prohibited Foreign Entity-Related Restrictions: The OBBB implements sweeping restrictions relating to “prohibited foreign entities” (or “PFEs”) for the Sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X credits,[1] disqualifying eligibility for such credits if the taxpayer is a PFE or if the taxpayer receives “material assistance” from a PFE. “Material assistance” is determined using a cost-based formula benchmarked against technology-specific thresholds. In respect of the Sections 45Y and 48E credits, the material assistance restrictions apply to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, and in respect of the Section 45X credit, such restrictions generally apply to components manufactured in 2026 or later.

Terminating Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credits: The OBBB erminates the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production credit for projects on which construction begins after December 31, 2027. Significantly, the OBBB’s termination timeline is five years earlier than the current IRA sunset date for the Section 45V credit.

Extending the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit: The bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years, through 2029 (prior to enactment, these credits would expire in 2027). Additionally, credit eligibility for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is contingent on such fuel being exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and its emissions rates cannot be negative (with an exception for animal manure-derived transportation fuels).

Ending the tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs) and related infrastructure: The Section 30D Clean Vehicle credit—which allows consumers to obtain a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for used EVs—will now terminate on September 30, 2025. Additionally, the Section 30C credit for EV charging infrastructure will terminate after June 30, 2026.

Other Notable Energy Provisions

The OBBB contains other notable provisions related to the energy sector, including:

Increased royalties on oil and natural gas leases: The OBBB restores the pre-IRA royalty rates on oil and gas leases from 16.6% to 12.5%, and repeals the IRA-codified royalty imposed on methane produced from oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. The OBBB would also require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a minimum of four oil and gas lease sales of available land in nine western states per year, and 30 region-wide oil and gas lease sales over the next 15 years (at least two per year). It also removes Biden-era restrictions on leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.

Funding for critical minerals mining: Congress appropriated $5 billion to the Secretary of Defense for investments in critical minerals supply chains, as well as $2 billion to improve the S. stockpile of critical minerals through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund.

S. petroleum reserves: $171 million is appropriated to the Department of Energy to acquire petroleum products for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

“Energy Dominance” grant: $1 billion in funding is appropriated for the Department of Energy’s loan program to support various energy initiatives.

Next Steps

Federal activity now shifts to the individual agencies to implement the new law, including regulatory changes that will provide opportunities for public comment. Entities across manufacturing, energy, transportation, infrastructure, real estate, and other sectors should also watch for state-level environmental actions and funding opportunities as federal incentives wane.

Sidley Austin’s Environmental and Energy practices are closely tracking the progress of this law and related regulatory developments. We are available to advise clients on risk assessments and compliance protocols, and investment planning in response to the OBBB and the coming regulatory changes.

[1] There are similar restrictions applicable to the Section 45Q carbon capture credit and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit.

By aligning bacterial cellulose (BC) fibers through a dynamic, rotational biosynthesis process, the team has created transparent, flexible, and ultra-strong sheets that rival metals and plastics in performance — without the environmental tradeoffs.

Published in Nature Communications, the research outlines a scalable, single-step method that uses controlled fluid flow to direct the growth of cellulose-producing bacteria. The result: nanofiber alignment in real time, producing biopolymer sheets with tensile strength up to 436 MPa, and 553 MPa when enhanced with boron nitride nanosheets — surpassing many synthetic composites in both strength and thermal conductivity.

From Disorder to Precision: Training Bacteria for Performance

Plastic pollution persists because synthetic polymers break down into harmful microplastics. Bacterial cellulose, one of Earth’s most abundant and pure biopolymers, offers a biodegradable alternative — and now, we’ve unlocked its full potential.

The challenge with bacterial cellulose has long been its random fiber orientation, which limits mechanical performance. By introducing a rotational bioreactor, the team leveraged fluid shear forces to align the motion of Novacetimonas hansenii, a cellulose-producing bacteria.

“Our approach involved developing a rotational bioreactor that directs the movement of cellulose-producing bacteria,” said M.A.S.R. Saadi, the study’s first author and a doctoral student at Rice. “This alignment significantly enhances the mechanical properties of microbial cellulose, creating a material as strong as some metals and glasses yet flexible, foldable, transparent and environment friendly.”

Building Multifunctionality into the Manufacturing Process

Beyond strength, the researchers infused hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) into the nutrient solution, enabling simultaneous material enhancement during biosynthesis. The resulting hybrid bionanocomposite offers three times faster heat dissipation than traditional BC — a promising feature for thermal management in green electronics.

“This dynamic biosynthesis approach enables the creation of stronger materials with greater functionality,” Saadi added. “The method allows for the easy integration of various nanoscale additives directly into the bacterial cellulose, making it possible to customize material properties for specific applications.”

The process is chemical-free, energy-efficient, and compatible with existing incubator equipment, making it immediately viable for industrial upscaling.

Tech Applications: From Circuit Boards to Thermal Shields

With its optical clarity, mechanical durability, and customizable nanoscale functionality, flow-aligned bacterial cellulose is poised to disrupt a wide range of markets:

Flexible electronics and displays

Heat-dissipating films in data centers and EVs

Biodegradable packaging with embedded conductivity

Textiles and wearable tech materials

Lightweight structural components

“The synthesis process is essentially like training a disciplined bacterial cohort,” Saadi explained. “Instead of having the bacteria move randomly, we instruct them to move in a specific direction, thus precisely aligning their cellulose production.”

A Biopolymer Designed for the Circular Economy

As the tech sector seeks low-impact alternatives to plastic films, PET layers, and synthetic polymers, this innovation arrives with high relevance for ESG-aligned industries.

According to First Street, ""We have spent nearly a decade advancing research in climate and flood risk modeling.","Western North Carolina homeowners are pushing back on climate risk labels they argue don't match reality.

News 13 Investigates talked with several homeowners who have raised concerns and the company behind the data to explore the broader impacts on property owners and home sales.

FOR SALE - LITTLE INTEREST

John and Laura Haldane have done their share of wandering across the globe.

“At our core, people are the same everywhere — we all love music, family, hugs, and dancing,” explained John, standing in front of a map of the globe with pins marking the couple’s travels.

The currents have always carried them back to the mountains.

“This has been such a special place in our hearts,” said John.

Recently, those winds shifted.

“I’m dragging my heels,” said John.

“We want the house to sell, but it was hard,” explained Laura. “Nibbles before it actually went on the market, and then almost nothing since,” said Laura.

A call to their realtor unraveled why they haven’t seen much traffic.

“The buyers' agent said the buyers were concerned about the high flood risk, and we were shocked,” said Laura.

Confused, they checked their listing on popular real estate websites.

CLIMATE RISK RATINGS

“It’s in very large print. We are a 10 out of 10 extreme risk for flooding,” said John about what they found.

It's a hard rating to swallow since during Hurricane Helene, rainfall maps showed that between 13 and 15 inches fell at their home over three days, and the property never flooded.

“I thought this was so obviously incorrect. It should be easy just to point out why it’s incorrect and get the information changed,” said Laura.

It has been anything but easy, and Brian Cagle, Allen Tate/Beverly-Hanks' regional vice president, said the Haldanes aren’t alone.

“We pulled some numbers in Waynesville, and we have 20 properties that are not in a flood zone, did not flood, and have very high ratings, so I don’t know why,” said Cagle.

IMPACT ON WNC MOUNTAINS

The rating comes from First Street Technology. Its climate risk ratings started in September on websites including Zillow, Realtor.com and Redfin, among others.

“We’re appreciative of their work and their efforts and their concern for climate change, that’s all great, but it has to be right. The data has to be accurate,” said Cagle, who has since reached out to the NC Realtors Board, which was looking into the matter.

In addition to the Haldanes, the LeGwins in Asheville, the Schrecks in Hendersonville, and the DeMerrits in Pisgah Forest reached out to News 13 when their 10 of 10 flood rating also ran buyers off.

We reached out to First Street Technology with their concerns. The company pointed us to their YouTube page, which explains their flood modeling. It uses physics versus statistics to predict heavier rainfalls now and 30 years from now.

“It’s actually simulating rainfall on this earth, how that rainfall moves across the surface, collects into streams and rivers, and moves downhill, basically,” said Dr. Ed Kearns, chief science officer for First Street Technology, in the on flood modeling.

Coupled with data from FEMA, NASA, USGS and the Army Corps of Engineers, the model generates a score, not just for a region, but for specific homes, according to First Street’s video.

The above graphic and image from the News 13 drone show why the Haldanes' question whether the data is accurate.

When checking neighboring properties above and below the Haldanes' lot, five were rated one out of 10, and two received nines for flood factors.

“Water flows downhill, so there’s no way that we can have polar opposite flood risks,” said Laura.

All four of the homeowners who reached out to News 13 had minimal flood risk in North Carolina's Flood Risk Information System. First Street's YouTube video also explained why the models differ.

“Unfortunately, that doesn’t tell the whole story because flood zones don’t capture heavy rainfall, and those FEMA flood zones are not capturing climate change,” said Dr. Kearns.

CAN YOU DISPUTE IT?

First Street's says: ""As a rule, we do not update factor scores based on individual requests or disputes.”

However, in an email, a spokesperson told News 13 they would review the addresses I shared, plus any FEMA letters of map amendments, elevation certificates, base flood elevation documents, and proof of new construction or updates not in public record that homeowners submitted.

The LeGwins sent both Zillow and First Street some of that data, but Zillow confirmed First Street’s assessment in a letter and said the climate risk feature will remain. The Haldanes got a similar response.

“Their policy is not to make changes,” said Laura of the email they received back from their complaint to First Street.

News 13 reached out to a local environmental scientist and geologist familiar with area flooding. After consulting debris flow maps, he didn’t understand the varying scores around the Haldanes' property.

The LeGwins' property is mapped at risk for a debris flow, but the Schrecks' Hendersonville property is out of the floodway. That is why the Land of the Sky Association of Realtors is encouraging home buyers not to just look at these scores.

“I would remind folks it’s a projection and that there are other modeling programs out there, so as with anything else, check multiple sources, visit the property and develop your own conclusions,” said realtor Rachel Brown.

Even First Street admits a property ranked 10 of 10 for extreme flooding may never flood, which home sellers say is frustrating.

News 13 is aware that several homeowners have filed complaints about First Street's data with the North Carolina Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division. They have reached out to First Street on the homeowners’ behalf.

News 13 also found nationwide complaints with the Better Business Bureau about First Street’s Data, with the responses that they don’t address individual concerns.

First Street has yet to get back to News 13 about the addresses we provided.

DISPUTE PROCESS:

According to First Street Technology, ""anyone can submit a dispute"" at .

First Street told News 13 the following:

""We want to assure you that every submission is reviewed to ensure data accuracy. In the rare instance that data is found to be incorrect or if appropriate supporting documentation is provided, we take prompt action to issue a response. If not, our system directs users to the following resources to help them better understand their score.""

Congressional Democrats are calling for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to reinstate 139 of the agency’s employees, who were recently put on administrative leave after signing a letter dissenting with its latest policies.

On Tuesday, several members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee claimed the action by President Donald Trump’s administration is illegal, since the employees are whistleblowers.

“Taking adverse actions against employees for making a protected disclosure — including investigating them and placing them on administrative leave — in a manner that deters others from coming forward is a textbook violation of the whistleblower Protection Act,” the lawmakers said in a letter sent to Zeldin.

The letter was signed by the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, as well as New York Reps. Paul Tonko and Yvette Clarke.

A group of Democratic lawmakers from Virginia and Maryland also spoke out against the action taken by Zeldin at a news conference on Tuesday.

“Zeldin and his Trump administration colleagues are taking taxpayer money and sabotaging the essential work that this agency does to protect public health,” said Rep. Don Beyer, who represents Virginia’s 8th District.

Beyer was joined by fellow Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, of the 11th District, as well as Maryland Reps. Glenn Ivey, who represents the 4th District, and April McClain Delaney, of the 6th District.

“These 139 (workers) stand up for the safety of the public, for the safety and protection of the environment, for the assistance and help of the American people; and the first thing they do is try to kick them out,” Ivey said. “It’s wrong, it’s retaliatory and we have to do everything we can to turn it around.”

EPA’s ‘zero tolerance’

When the EPA announced the employees were being put on administrative leave last week, it accused them of “unlawfully undermining” the administration’s agenda.

The employees had signed a “declaration of dissent,” arguing that the agency is failing to maintain its mission to protect public health and the environment.

The EPA said in a statement that it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the president’s agenda. But employees were also told it was not a disciplinary action.

The EPA said the employees would be paid during their “temporary, non-duty” status for a period of two weeks, as an administration investigation was carried out.

Under Zeldin’s leadership, the EPA has reduced funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, proposed repealing rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions and undid a ban on a type of asbestos.

During a cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, Zeldin said the president’s “one big beautiful bill” that was approved by Congress last week delivered a “sledgehammer” to what he called the “green new scam,” which is what administration officials often call various environmental initiatives approved when former President Joe Biden was in office.

Zeldin touted various efforts to reduce spending in the agency.

“This is about us being good stewards of American tax dollars, without any apology or regret,” he said.

Key Takeaways Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance.
Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.","On July 4th, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”), which included a phaseout of incentives for solar and wind generation projects. Projects must either begin construction within one year or be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit or the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit. The House’s version of the legislation required a more accelerated phaseout than the Act and only allowed projects that began construction within 60 days of enactment of the bill to be eligible for the tax credits. In discussions last week with House conservatives who favored the faster phaseout of solar and wind tax credits, which was not adopted in the Act, President Trump promised strict enforcement of the rules, including the beginning of construction requirements, for solar and wind projects to qualify for energy tax credits.

On July 7th, President Trump issued an Executive Order (“EO”) titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources. In the EO, the Trump Administration directs the Treasury Secretary to “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities” within 45 days following the enactment of the Act.

Beginning of Construction Rules

Specifically, the EO directs the Treasury Department to issue new and revised guidance for the beginning of construction requirements, which it states should prevent the “artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” and “restrict the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Many House conservatives disfavor the current IRS guidance provisions: the Five Percent Safe Harbor and the Physical Work Test. The Five Percent Safe Harbor allows energy projects to demonstrate “beginning of construction” by incurring at least five percent of the total project cost, even if the project isn’t completed within the same tax year. The Physical Work Test allows a taxpayer to establish “beginning of construction” by beginning physical work of a significant nature.

These “beginning of construction” tests are set forth in IRS Notices. Because IRS Notices are informal guidance and not formal guidance, the IRS may withdraw, amend, or issue notices at any time. Taxpayers may rely on the existing IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59, both specifically referenced in the Act, until Treasury and the IRS withdraw and/or issue new guidance.

The “beginning of construction” rules are important not only to retain eligibility for the credits past the termination date for the credit, but also to determine whether a project must meet the foreign entity of concern requirements set forth in the Act.

Foreign Entity of Concern Requirements

The EO also directs the Treasury Secretary to take “prompt action” to implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions in the Act within 45 days following enactment. The complex FEOC provisions included in the Act limit the ability of “prohibited foreign entities,” as defined in the Act, to claim tax credits for qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Taxpayers cannot claim these credits if they engage in sourcing (including, “material assistance”), licensing, or payments to a prohibited foreign entity. The material assistance restriction renders a taxpayer ineligible for the credit if a certain percentage of the value of a project is sourced from one or more prohibited foreign entities. A taxpayer needs to have a ratio higher than the thresholds set forth in the Act to qualify for the credit.

There are some exceptions, including for certain foreign-controlled publicly traded companies. There are also exceptions for certain manufactured products and eligible components acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and that are placed into service before January 1, 2030 (or for wind and solar facilities before January 1, 2028) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Key Takeaways

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination.

The Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba is choking on smoke as fires rage through the territories, with 767 people trying to escape the worst fires in history. The skies are filled with smoke here even, and the sun has been red in the sky for days. It’s really a terrifying feeling, that is hard to escape, it’s in our DNA to be fearful of catastrophe.

As the air particulates come to our land, and towns like Detroit Lakes and Grand Marais hit records for poor air quality, we go outside in masks or not at all .We are closer than we think. Some of our electricity comes from this very community, and the price is high. “Many that couldn’t get out because the junction at Highway 374 and Highway 373 is their lifeline to Norway House, and now it’s being compromised by the fire and the smoke,” said Chief David Monias, Chief of the Nation at Pimicikamak Okimawin – Cross Lake Band.

Terrifying. Pimicikamak is Cree territory of the north – Cross Lake it’s called. The word refers to a current cross the lake. It’s the same word as Bemidji – or Bemdjigaamag. The lake with a cross current. As I write, the airport is closed, roads and rivers compromised. Residents were being flown out from the bush airport, about 530 kilometers north of Winnipeg, but high winds and dry conditions worsened the situation, flights were cancelled without notice, just as Chief Monias issued a full evacuation order, telling the remaining 6,500 residents of the territory to head south to Norway House Cree Nation.

That’s another community is under an evacuation notice. While the media treats the raging fires as sort of an annual horror show, the background to these times has been building. Pimicikamak’s traditional territory is the upper Nelson River watershed, Kichi Sipi (Cree for Great River, or Mississippi). It drains the fourth largest watershed in North America. Lake Winnipeg, the seventh largest lake in North America, and two of the continent’s largest rivers.

There’s been a long assault on the integrity of that ecosystem, with Minnesotans as some of the primary beneficiaries. What am I talking about? Manitoba Hydro and the mega dams. Hydro electric power has been misrepresented as clean energy – but that’s a matter of scale. Drowning entire ecosystems under water, creating wastelands of dead trees, and receding shoreline, silting and clogging dams till they are inefficient.

Ecologically, the extensive boreal shoreline ecosystem nourishes the vast forests of the north and that destruction has a large ripple for the boreal forest. The boreal forest is an ecological stronghold remaining in North America. It is the northern lung of the planet, covering 40% of Canada’s land mass (and part of it is in Russia). It may be as important as the world’s rainforests (the other lung) in producing oxygen and absorbing greenhouse gases. But the boreal forest is now the most threatened of all major landscapes on our planet according to William Pruitt, at the University of Manitoba.

In Manitoba alone, hydro-electric development has resulted in the flooding or clearing of roughly 600,000 acres of boreal forest. That is roughly 10 times the area lost to clear-cutting in Canada annually. In addition, an unknown area of forest is lost each year as destabilized land is dumped into rivers and lakes by erosion. Canada is the world’s largest producer of hydroelectricity. The people who are dammed are Indigenous – a way of life buried under huge dams.

“Our people are grieving; they are grieving for land, the water and a way of life that was brought to an abrupt halt. I remember going along the shoreline to pick medicine with my late grandmother only to find it flooded. My grandmother stood there crying because that was her life. Her life was the land.”said Bobby Brightnose, traditional healer told a reporter.

“Millions of tons of earth wash into the rivers and lakes from shoreline erosion each year; erosion of burial sites continues to take place. Historic camp sites are washed away. Entire islands disappear. Spawning grounds have been destroyed. Wildlife has become scarce. Navigation has become hazardous. Our people feel and fear the effects day after day, week after week, year after year.” Nelson Miller, Pimicikamak Executive Council, said.

The response: “…it’s just the cost of doing business,” Manitoba Hydro President and CEO said, in regard to the 1994 death of a Pimicikamak citizen in a boating accident caused by Manitoba Hydro’s hydro-electric project. Who has benefited? That would be the US. The north has dams, and the powerlines go south. That’s what an energy colony looks like, and money is to be made. One of the largest contracts with Manitoba Hydro is with XCEL Energy. That, however, is about to change. Between Trump’s Trade War with Canada, and a visionary Premier of Manitoba – Wab Kinew, the first Anishinaabe Premier of Manitoba, the XCEL contracts will not be renewed.

On Aprii 14, Kinew announced that Manitoba Hydro would not renew two contracts totaling 500 megawatts of power capacity to XCEL. Instead, Manitoba has decided to export power to Nunavut, a largely Indigenous Province further north.

One more point. These fires are the direct result of fossil fuel combustion. Between Canada’s dirty tar sands, and Enbridge, there’s an ecological mess being made. Far away, those fires, but the smoke is in my lungs, scorches my throat and my primal fears are at an all-time high.

Pimicikamik, I pray for you.",https://thecirclenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hydro-damn.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:53.277558

Changes to the big, beautiful bill allow the automaker to plan on multi-million dollar tax breaks

The decision set criteria for Ford to show its Chinese affiliation was not an equal partnership

Ford Motor Co.’s massive electric vehicle battery factory under construction in Marshall will be eligible for federal tax credits after revisions to President Donald Trump’s so-called $3.4 trillion ""big, beautiful bill.”

The change follows a warning from the automaker’s executive chair Bill Ford Jr. in May, when he told Michigan business leaders gathered on Mackinac Island that the planned EV tax cuts in the bill “imperiled” the $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park.

Now Ford can move ahead with opening the facility as planned in 2026 with assurances that it could qualify for the Biden-era credits for manufacturers in effect when it launched construction in 2023 due to changes in how the US views the automaker’s relationship with a Chinese battery maker.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford spokesperson Jessica Enoch told Bridge in a statement on Tuesday.

Qualifying for the tax credit, she continued, is “a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

The factory is among Michigan’s largest manufacturing projects inked during the administration of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Originally valued at $3.5 billion, it promised 2,500 jobs in the community east of Battle Creek,

Facing concerns about EV profitability and battery capacity, Ford (NYSE:F) hit pause on the project after the state committed over $1.3 billion in public funding, including tax breaks and land development.

The automaker [NYSE:F] later reinstated its plans to build EV batteries with the less-expensive LFP technology, licensed from Chinese partner CATL.

Bill Ford: Federal EV policy changes ‘imperil’ $2B Michigan EV factory

Stung by EV losses, Ford plans smaller Michigan factory with fewer jobs

But this year, the Trump administration vowed to end federal subsidies for the EV market. The production credit — along with several other clean energy credits, including the $7,500 credit for buyers of many EVs — had been eliminated in the House and early Senate versions of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The move prompted Ford’s warnings, saying it was not fair to change the funding mid-stream, even as he said he agreed with the motives “to have a strong American industrial base.”

The sticking point became scrutiny by lawmakers of the CATL deal due to strained US-Chinese relations, prompting questions about Ford’s affiliation with the “foreign entity of concern.”

The Senate, after more than a month of lobbying by Ford, set the tax break criteria on “effective control” in the partnership, the Automotive News reported Tuesday.

The Dearborn automaker has said it is in control because it owns the site in Marshall and its equipment, the publication said, while CATL trains Ford workers.

Under the new revisions, the 45X Advance Manufacturing Production Credit will provide a credit of $35 per kWh for battery cells and $10 per kWh for modules. The bill says EV batteries must contain 60% U.S. content in 2026, increasing to 85% in 2030.

With the factory’s capacity reaching 20 gigawatt hours per year, the tax break could be worth tens of millions to Ford annually.

While Ford proceeds with its plans to open in Marshall in 2026, critics of CATL’s involvement are not comforted by the bill’s distinction of who’s in control.

""The nature of the ‘deal’ between Ford and China-based and Chinese Communist Party (CCP)- tied CATL remains high risk and volatile, both for our national security and taxpayers,” said Joseph Cella of Michigan, who served as US ambassador to Fiji.

The alliance remains “politically fraught,” Cella said. “I trust the Trump administration will continue to fortify the provision of our common defense from the threat presented by the CCP to our national and economic security.""

Marshall business leaders who were instrumental in the Ford deal are relieved by the final bill, they said. Many raised concerns about the end of the tax credit and emphasized over the last month that they are counting on this project’s economic boost.

“We are thrilled to hear that President Trump and Congress came together to preserve the pro-growth federal tax policies that ensure families and businesses across southwest Michigan and the state will continue to benefit from Ford’s investment in BlueOval Battery Park,” said James Durian, CEO of Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance.

“When Ford’s facility begins production next year, it will bring back our supply chain to the United States, which will make our country less reliant on – and more competitive with – foreign countries like China,” Durian said.

Even with the production tax credits surviving threatened cuts, Ford is still planning on EV battery production at a time when the market is volatile and rapidly changing.

Intense rain is falling more frequently in many areas of the U.S. — though where it occurs and whether it causes catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance, according to experts.
This week, flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in other parts of North Carolina.
Nielsen-Gammon said the overall intensity of extreme rainfall in Texas has increased by 15% over the past 40-50 years.
Still, it’s almost impossible to predict where the most catastrophic rain will fall in any given year, Kunkel said.","It’s not just Texas and North Carolina. Intense rain is falling more frequently in many areas of the U.S. — though where it occurs and whether it causes catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance, according to experts.

More than 100 people died in Texas Hill Country over the weekend after 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in just hours. The deluge was driven by warm, moist air left over from Tropical Storm Barry and Hurricane Flossie that created conditions for repeated thunderstorms in the same location, said Texas Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon.

Last year, Hurricane Helene dumped more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain on western North Carolina, triggering catastrophic flooding that washed away roads and homes, killing more than 100 people in that state alone. This week, flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in other parts of North Carolina. And this spring, record rainfall in Kentucky caused severe and deadly flooding.

Although it can be difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change — and hilly or mountainous terrain worsen flooding — experts say a warming atmosphere and oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels make catastrophic storms more likely.

That’s because the atmosphere can hold 7% more water for every degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), creating a giant sponge of sorts that sucks up moisture from bodies of water and vegetation. The moisture later falls back to earth in increasingly intense, unpredictable and destructive downpours.

“It’s just loading the dice toward heavy rainfall when the situation is right,” said Kenneth Kunkel, a climate scientist at North Carolina State University.

Intensifying rain storms

Going back through U.S. weather station records dating to 1955, Kunkel found that rain over the past 20 years has become more intense in the eastern two-thirds of the country, including the southern Great Plains, where Texas is located. Intensities have remained the same or declined in the West and southwest.

At the 700 stations that began collecting data in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the highest proportion of two-day rainfall records have been set in just the past 10 years, Kunkel said, though that doesn’t fully reflect most Western stations, which were established later.

Nielsen-Gammon said the overall intensity of extreme rainfall in Texas has increased by 15% over the past 40-50 years.

Still, it’s almost impossible to predict where the most catastrophic rain will fall in any given year, Kunkel said.

“This month was the Texas Hill Country’s turn to get hit. Last fall ... in western North Carolina, it was our turn,” Kunkel said, adding that just because an area was spared over the past 20 or 30 years, it “doesn’t mean that they aren’t vulnerable. ... They got lucky.”

A ‘perfect storm’ in Texas

The worst flooding and greatest loss of life in Texas occurred in Kerr County, in an area known as “flash flood alley” because of its steep terrain that funnels water to the Guadalupe River, a popular recreational area.

Though the county did not get the most rain from the storms, the “distribution of rainfall was one of the worst possible patterns” because the most intense downpours were over the headwaters of the south fork of the Guadalupe River, causing water to rush into areas where hundreds of people, including children, were camping, said Nielsen-Gammon.

If the epicenter had been 10 miles (16 kilometers) north or south, the rain would have been divided among different river basins, he said. If it had been farther downstream, larger floodplains would have absorbed and slowed much of the water.

Years of drought also likely exacerbated the flooding.

Kerr County, for example, had been in extreme or exceptional drought for more than three years, aside from one four-week period last fall. That likely left the soil compacted, which caused water to run off instead of soaking into the ground, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist.

Then, air from the warmer-than-normal Gulf of Mexico — a reflection of global warming — blew into the state with a higher water content than it would have had decades ago.

It all added up to “just a perfect storm of events” that caused a catastrophe, said Rippey. “There are things that had to come together to make this happen.”

The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure ​“will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.","On June 30, after an exhausting round of late-night negotiations, Delaware state legislators passed a bill to effectively green-light the Southeast’s second offshore wind farm. Within days, lawmakers in Washington passed legislation that may doom its future.

MarWin, the first phase of a 114-turbine project off the Delmarva Peninsula, is slated for installation in 2028 with onshore construction possibly starting next year, but that timeline is perhaps unrealistic, said Harrison Sholler, an offshore wind analyst with BloombergNEF. MarWin doesn’t have its financing in place yet to underwrite construction and, to make matters worse, Congress just unleashed a crushing new deadline.

When President Donald Trump signed the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” on Friday, he dramatically shortened the window in which offshore wind projects can qualify for tax credits that offset up to 30% of their costs. The law now requires new wind farms be ​“placed in service” by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify.

“We don’t predict any new offshore wind projects starting construction … at least in the next four years,” Sholler told Canary Media two days before Congress passed the bill.

He described Republicans’ tightening of the tax credit — from an original deadline to start construction by 2033 or potentially later, to this one-year sprint — as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that are fully approved but not currently underway. Two projects — MarWin near Maryland and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — float in this gray zone, and are now vulnerable to being put on ice indefinitely.

Wind developers have faced mounting hurdles in recent months: new tariffs, a federal permitting pause, higher investment risk, and the looming threat of the Trump administration halting already-approved projects, like it did in a shocking monthlong pause on New York’s Empire Wind.

A BloombergNEF report released in April states that losing the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, known as 45Y and 48E, would be ​“devastating” for U.S. projects already in the pipeline. Analysts estimate that the electricity produced by offshore wind farms that qualify for the credits costs on average 24% less over a project’s lifetime.

That April report predicted ​“all but the most advanced projects [will] pause development activities.” Now, with tax credits officially rolled back, prospects for offshore wind appear even more dim.

“If you take away the tax credits, it doesn’t make much sense to develop an entirely new sector,” said Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College who studies offshore wind policy.

America’s offshore wind sector is still in its infancy. While the U.K. has already built over 50 wind farms in its waters, America has only completed one large-scale project: South Fork Wind, located off the coast of Long Island, New York.

Trump issued an executive order on Inauguration Day that froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe from the president’s ire at the time were eight projects, including MarWin, that already had all their federal permits in hand. Since then, at least one of those permitted projects — the 2.8-gigawatt Atlantic Shores project off the New Jersey coast — has fallen apart. Five are currently under construction.

The largest offshore wind project now being built in America — Dominion Energy’s 2.6-gigawatt Virginia project — appears unscathed by the Inflation Reduction Act rollback.

“There is no impact to Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. The project is nearly 60 percent complete and is on schedule to be completed in late 2026,” wrote Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy, in an email to Canary Media, dispelling concerns that the 176-turbine project off the Virginia coastline would suffer from the scaleback of tax credit eligibility.

The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure ​“will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.

Dominion has so far spent approximately $6 billion on this monumental project. Some in the industry feared that the impact of Trump’s reconciliation bill could have been far worse, and are celebrating that the five wind farms under construction might see full operation.

“While this fight is over, I’m incredibly proud of Oceantic’s members and staff,” said Liz Burdock, president and CEO of the offshore wind industry group, in a July 3 statement after Congress passed the bill. ​“Because of their relentless push, developers now have one year to start construction and retain 100% of their tax credits, with a simple ​‘safe harbor’ option.” (On Monday, Trump issued an executive order that tries to further limit the bill’s ​“safe harbor” and ​“beginning of construction” options.)

But for Maryland and Delaware state lawmakers who backed MarWin in the face of considerable county-level pushback in recent months, the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” is a major blow. The project’s turbines were slated for installation off Maryland’s coastline but its cables would come ashore in Delaware, making it a much-anticipated joint investment.

On June 30, Delaware’s Democratic lawmakers passed a bill that strips Sussex County officials of their ability to revoke local permits for certain aspects of the wind project. A county-level block on an onshore substation was MarWin’s final hurdle and clearing it meant construction on the substation could, in theory, begin as early as February of next year.

“This bill helps eliminate unlawful and unnecessary hurdles to a project that will help ensure electric reliability for Delawareans while lowering the price they pay for electricity,” Nancy Sopko, a spokesperson for MarWin developer US Wind, told Canary Media via email.

But whether US Wind can lock in financing and officially break ground by July 2026 — the new deadline for tax credit eligibility — is another story. US Wind is suing the Sussex County Council over the permit denial in hopes of starting earlier, before the new state law goes into effect.

Before signing the final bill, Delaware’s Gov. Matt Meyer (D) said it is important to get the offshore wind energy project ​“done quickly and safely to provide sustainable power to Delaware.” Within days, however, MarWin had potentially been rendered incapable — at least in the view of analysts — of taking advantage of the tax credits that would make its construction financially possible.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1867528717_2025-07-08-210740_mecq.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4bc2872d35bc32080f5e67f93d54916a,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:59.551375

Under the tax and spending bill President Trump signed last week, those credits will no longer be available after September 30.

Federal incentives for EVs have a reasonably long history — they have been around in some form since 2008, back when EVs were just barely a thing.

“It was, for most car companies, a tech demonstration, a very low-volume production … mostly because of the high price of batteries,” said Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis.

At that point, car companies didn’t really know if these things would work — or if they’d sell. And they were really expensive to produce.

But with a tax credit, Tal said, “that allowed them to start thinking about it as a larger volume production.”

Soon, companies started investing in new plants, battery technology, and supply chains. A tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle allowed car companies to charge more for EVs and let the credit soften some of the sticker shock for consumers, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

“The incentive lowers the price for the end consumer, while the manufacturer still gets to keep an additional $7,000 above what the consumer is paying for the electric vehicles,” he said.

Last year, the Biden administration made the credits available at the point of sale. That helped electrics grow to just over 8% of vehicle sales in the U.S.

“This meant that you didn't have to worry about having that extra money to pay for the vehicle upfront. It meant that it expanded the market, for the average person to be able to buy the vehicles,” said Tallis Blalack, a consultant on EV infrastructure projects.

If you’re interested in going electric after the credits go away, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, said a lot of leased EVs that benefited from a credit will soon come off lease into the used vehicle market.

“There's going to be a lot more options for consumers at different price points, different segments,” she said.

That could be one legacy that outlives the EV tax credit.",https://img.apmcdn.org/0150e8facc1096c95eb78d6ad4d768d4ef54090d/widescreen/ae3c18-20250708-aerial-view-of-a-busy-highway-2000.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:16.807136

The facility would be Alaska’s first green ammonia plant.
Pacific H2 said the green ammonia facility could bring 150 jobs to Adak, where about 50 people live today.
While conventional ammonia production relies heavily on fossil fuels, green ammonia is produced entirely using renewable energy sources.
After those approvals, Pacific H2 would need to secure the $1.7 to $2.5 billion in funding.","The Aleut Corp., Adak’s regional Native corporation, signed an agreement in May to lease 3,500 acres to Pacific H2, an Oregon-based energy company. The 90-year lease allows Pacific H2 to build wind turbines that would power a permanently docked green ammonia plant in Adak’s harbor. The facility would be Alaska’s first green ammonia plant.

“This is a transformational opportunity for Aleut and for Adak,” said Skoey Vergen, CEO of the Aleut Corp. “It isn't just a clean energy project, it's an economic engine for Adak and the entire Aleut region.”

Vergen described the green ammonia facility as a potential “anchor point” for revitalizing Adak, an island that formerly housed a large military base.

The project would be Pacific H2’s first facility and could cost nearly $2 billion to complete. The company plans to start a yearlong wind study this summer for the 70 wind turbines proposed for the project.

Pacific H2 said the green ammonia facility could bring 150 jobs to Adak, where about 50 people live today. The island has a lot of abandoned infrastructure from a naval air station that closed in 1997, and residents have been looking into ways to revitalize their community.

Adak City Manager Breck Craig said the community is mostly excited about the facility’s potential benefits, like high-paying jobs and access to renewable energy.

“It's a real game changer, as long as they can address the environmental concerns around ammonia,” Craig said.

So what exactly is green ammonia? It’s not the color that makes it “green” – it’s how the ammonia is produced. While conventional ammonia production relies heavily on fossil fuels, green ammonia is produced entirely using renewable energy sources.

Pacific H2 would use Adak’s wind and water to power and produce the facility. The company expects the plant will make more than 2,000 tons of ammonia annually.

Ammonia can be toxic in high concentrations, a particular concern given that part of Adak lies within the federally protected Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.

Pacific H2’s CEO Charles Deister said the facility would follow established safety protocols used in industrial ammonia plants for decades, including double-walled pipes and multiple containment systems.

“We’ll have gas detection systems, emergency ventilation systems, there'll be various alarms, automatic shutdown valves,” Deister said in a community presentation in June.

The company also plans to establish a “buffer zone” prohibiting vessel traffic around the facility.

So why invest in green ammonia? According to Deister, green ammonia is in high demand in Asia, making Adak’s location ideal for shipping.

“Adak is as far west as we can get. It reduces the shipping time to the lowest possible,” he said. “For example, Adak to Tokyo is a seven-day shipping time at 14 knots.”

The project still needs permits and environmental reviews, which could take several years. After those approvals, Pacific H2 would need to secure the $1.7 to $2.5 billion in funding. If all goes according to plan, the facility could begin producing green ammonia by 2032.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/260fc76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3037x1594+0+57/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2Fe2%2F3850207c42f8856fec7664256629%2Fimg-9652.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:05:04.078096

Introducing new tax deductions for businesses and rollbacks of clean energy measures, the bill, which was signed into law on July 4, saw criticism from labor unions concerned about workers and apprentices on renewable energy jobs. Some contractors and engineering firms applauded the bill for job creation and growth through extended tax reform.

The 900-page legislation included a wide range of tax breaks, spending cuts, money for national defense and deportation, the Associated Press reported. The new law affects nearly every American citizen, with money for the border wall and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP funding.

The legislation has around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, which lawmakers said was crucial as tax breaks from Trump’s first term were set to expire in December, the AP reported. It will solidify the tax cuts approved in the president’s first term.

The SALT cap, which is a deduction limit on payment for state and local taxes, will quadruple from $10,000 to $40,000 through 2029, as reported by the AP.

Clean energy tax credits axed under ‘big beautiful’ bill

A big provision in the bill is cutting tax credits that were designed to boost clean energy projects that used renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. In 2022, former president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which focused on addressing climate change by incentivizing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Different legs of the construction industry have watched the IRA closely as the bill included prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship participation for clean energy credits. Around $2.7 billion in tax credits were included in the IRA for clean manufacturing and recycling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Tax breaks for solar and wind were crucial for labor unions such as the Laborers’ International Union of North America. After the Senate passed the bill, Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, said on social media the Senate’s version of the bill was a “jobs killer for the wind and solar industry.”

The bill included a provision that would get rid of tax credits for projects if they aren’t completed by 2027, Miller added.

“That means some projects that were counting on those credits may not move forward and that means less job opportunities for our members,” Miller said. “You might say, “Hey, I don’t work in solar, so this doesn’t affect me.” But as trade unionists we believe an injury to one is an injury to all. And health and pension funds live and die on growing members and growing more work hours,” he added.

Miller addressed the fact that the legislation included a temporary tax deduction on overtime.

“Not taxing your overtime doesn’t mean [expletive] if you don’t have a job,” he said.

Seven Wisconsin labor leaders representing trades such as painters, sheet metal workers, plumbers, concrete masons and electricians on July 2 took part in a virtual press event to speak out against the “big beautiful” bill and its rollbacks for federal incentives.

The BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit bridging labor unions and environmentalist groups that hosted the event, shared that the bill will risk $8.6 billion in private investments and put more than 7,000 jobs at risk in Wisconsin.

Andy Buck, the director of governmental affairs for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 7, said clean energy projects put union members to work and gave apprentices a start in the trades. Because of high apprenticeship participation standards, IUPAT saw a record number of apprentices last year, he added.

However, repealing the energy tax credit will mean communities already planning projects using that credit will have to rethink their plans, Buck said.

Engineering companies applaud the legislation

Before the bill made it to Trump’s desk, the American Council of Engineering Companies leadership on July 3 praised chambers of Congress for passing the spending bill and for its extension of tax laws established under the previous administration.

“ACEC applauds the passage of this critical legislation that will promote job creation and innovation across the U.S. Economy,” said Linda Bauer Darr, president and CEO of ACEC, in a statement. “The extension of the 2017 Tax Law will deliver critical certainty for American businesses. These are pro-growth policies that directly support investment, innovation, and workforce expansion, especially in the engineering sector,” she added.

Eighty-two percent of engineering companies used their tax savings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to hire new employees, data from the ACEC Research Institute showed. Tax savings were also used to invest in technology and expand services, officials added.

Among scores of business-related tax cuts, the legislation will allow businesses to write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.

“In addition, this bill includes a long-sought provision by ACEC to permanently restore full deductibility of R&D expenses for engineering firms,” Darr said. “Engineering firms are in the innovation business, designing the next generation of American infrastructure, and it was critical to restore the tax code’s traditional role in incentivizing research and development.

“As the bill heads to the president’s desk, we commend both chambers of Congress for delivering a package that gives America’s engineering industry the certainty it needs to improve our communities while developing the next generation of engineers. While more work remains, particularly around energy tax policy, this legislation is a strong step forward for America’s future,” Darr added.

The Associated Builders and Contractors also applauded the bill’s signing.

“On this July 4, ABC celebrates Congress and the White House working together to bring this pro-growth tax reform to reality for the millions of hardworking Americans who build and power our economy,” said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of government affairs, in a statement. “This new law provides long-overdue tax certainty that empowers construction businesses to invest in their workforce, expand operations and keep America building,” she added.

The legislation provided certainty to more than 95% of American businesses structured as S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships, ABC officials said. Those businesses employ 62% of the private sector workforce, officials added.

Highlighted reforms included solidifying deductions for small businesses, a permanent increase to the estate tax exclusion amount, restoration of full bonus depreciation and expanding the use of 529 savings accounts for career and technical education in the skilled trades.

“Now that this critical legislation has been signed, we urge Congress and the administration to build on this momentum by enacting additional reforms to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses,” Swearingen said. “Smart, targeted regulatory relief will give contractors even greater ability to create jobs, strengthen their communities and drive economic growth nationwide,” she added.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/07/Depositphotos_478070700_XL.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:15:21.918636

Dirty coal plants that continue to operate despite economic inefficiencies are sometimes called ""zombie"" plants.
""More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable, and more resilient.""
""The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump administration is forcing on the country's ratepayers.""
In 2017, the first Trump administration also moved to bail out financially floundering coal and nuclear plants.","Green groups warned Tuesday that the Trump administration's plan to invoke a bogus ""energy emergency"" in order to keep old, polluting coal-fired plants running will make electricity generation dirtier and more expensive while failing to produce enough power to keep up with surging demand.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy published a resource adequacy analysis that includes plans for boosting fossil-fueled electricity generation, including at coal-fired plants. The report cites President Donald Trump's executive orders declaring a national energy emergency and strengthening the reliability and security of the nation's electric grid, and highlights the DOE's plan to classify aging fossil fuel plants as critical to system reliability. The administration is also likely to continue invoking Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and the Defense Production Act in order to extend the lifespans of older fossil fuel plants.

Although the analysis acknowledges that ""old tools won't solve new problems,"" its methodology supports keeping expensive and polluting coal plants in operation. Dirty coal plants that continue to operate despite economic inefficiencies are sometimes called ""zombie"" plants.

""More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable, and more resilient.""

Not only does the report fail to state that the burning of fossil fuels is the leading driver of the climate emergency, it does not even mention the word ""climate"" once in its 73 pages. This tracks with the Trump administration's long-standing proscription of the term ""climate change.""

""The methodology released today is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country's energy future depends upon decades-old coal and gas plants, rather than clean renewables,"" said Sierra Club senior attorney Greg Wannier. ""The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump administration is forcing on the country's ratepayers.""

Wannier noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and states ""are already well equipped to meet any projected resource needs through the existing regulatory process, which ensures that electricity demand is reliably met at the least public cost.""

""Any effort by DOE to override this process to forcibly keep coal plants online past their planned retirements would be an extraordinary and unlawful overreach of its regulatory authority,"" Wannier added. ""It would be particularly harmful and costly to the communities living near these power plants who face the possibility of continued exposure to toxic levels of air and water pollution.""

Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said Tuesday:

The Trump administration is once again putting its thumb on the scale to help old, dirty power sources at the expense of air quality, public health, and higher energy bills for American families and businesses. This time it has issued a methodology that uses dodgy accounting to ignore all the clean energy we have at our disposal—including solar, wind, and battery technologies that are helping meet our nation's energy needs and support the reliability of our electric grid—in order to make a bogus case that these old, dirty power plants are needed. The administration's deeply flawed approach can't hide the fact that clean energy resources are helping keep lights on and lower electricity bills across the country, while keeping old, dirty power plants on life support will mean higher power bills for families and more toxic, cancer-causing pollution in the air we breathe.

The Trump administration has already used the nonexistent energy emergency in a push to fast-track fossil fuel permitting, keep fossil-fueled plants operating, and to wage lawfare against Democrat-controlled states trying to hold Big Oil financially accountable for its role in causing the climate emergency. In 2017, the first Trump administration also moved to bail out financially floundering coal and nuclear plants.

""No matter how they try to gussy it up, bailing out coal or other fossil fuels when low-cost solar and wind power is growing so quickly makes even less sense today than it did in 2017 when the previous Trump administration tried it before,"" Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said in response to the DOE plan.

""It's ironic that the Energy Department is warning about reliability just days after Republicans in Congress repealed the clean energy tax credits,"" Kennedy added, referring to a provision in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by Trump on Friday.

NRDC cites analysts' predictions that the legislation will reduce additions of the electricity needed to meet rapidly growing demand and raise wholesale electricity prices as much as 25% by 2030 and up to 74% by 2035.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61180292&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C76%2C0%2C77,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:21.141686

Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.
VinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024.
However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.
While VinFast Auto currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","Understanding the electric vehicle market has become increasingly important over the past several years as EV sales have really started to explode.

Looking forward, EVs are likely to become a larger part of the overall economy, presenting a significant opportunity for investors. The International Energy Agency reported that in 2024, 20% of new cars sold were electric vehicles. They expect this number to grow to 40% by 2030, positioning EVs as a clear growth market. However, the path to this is not likely to be a straight one, especially as government attitudes toward EVs shift.

Take the passing of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” for example. It means that the significant tax breaks that come from buying EVs in the United States will expire in September, which will weigh on adoption. Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.

VinFast Auto NASDAQ: VFS and Lucid Group NASDAQ: LCID stand out as two electric vehicle stocks with high upside potential, positioned to benefit from shifting market dynamics and evolving U.S. policies.

Big Beautiful Bill Increases VinFast’s Chances of U.S. Success

VinFast makes and sells relatively low-cost EVs primarily in Vietnam. The MarketBeat consensus price target on the company is $5.75, implying that shares could rise by nearly 64%.

Ending the EV tax credit actually helps VinFast. Its vehicles were not eligible to receive it before, putting it at a disadvantage in the U.S. market. Now, the playing field will become more level as domestic companies will no longer receive the credit either.

VinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024. Thus, the United States represents a significant growth opportunity for VinFast that just became easier to capitalize on. However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.

Still, Vinfast clearly doesn’t need the United States to grow fast. EV deliveries spiked 296% last quarter, while E-scooter deliveries rose 473%. The company is still deeply unprofitable, with a gross margin of negative 35%. However, this figure is a big improvement over its negative 59% gross margin a year ago. VinFast will need to continue making progress here by accelerating production and deliveries to achieve greater economies of scale. The recent opening of the company’s second factory should aid this. The company also just signed with its first authorized dealership in California as it looks to expand its U.S. presence.

Recent Price Targets Indicate +40% Upside in Lucid

The MarketBeat consensus price target on Lucid is $2.68, implying a solid but not huge 27% upside in shares. However, focusing on the stock’s two most recent price target updates paints a considerably more bullish picture. Both come in at $3, which implies 42% upside in shares.

In contrast to VinFast, most of the company’s revenue comes from the United States, accounting for around 73% of its total sales in 2024. The rest of the company’s sales primarily come from Saudi Arabia. The company will no longer be able to benefit from tax credits post-September, but some believe that this will actually help Lucid.

That includes James Picariello of BNP Paribas. He believes that the sunsetting of the credit means that Lucid will face less EV competition. This is because companies that make both EVs and gas-powered vehicles may “deemphasize” their EV ambitions in the United States as government incentives go away. This is plausible, but it is also important to note that companies like Ford Motor NYSE: F have invested billions in their EV efforts. Given the long-term growth many see in this market, they are not likely to simply hand over this growth to EV pure plays.

In Q2, Lucid’s vehicle deliveries hit 3,309, rising by 38% compared to the same period a year ago. Like many early-stage EV makers, Lucid remains highly unprofitable. It will need to significantly boost deliveries to change this.

Winning in the United States Is Key to VinFast and Lucid’s Success

VinFast and Lucid are attempting to compete in the crowded U.S. vehicle market. Success will be key to achieving the scale required to be profitable one day. With EV tax credits set to expire soon, shifts in the competitive landscape may help their ambitions, which could help shares achieve the significant upside some analysts see.

“While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim,” reports Tech Crunch.

A potent combination of tariffs, anti-clean energy legislation, and stunningly bad PR have led to devastating drops in the company’s share values, with reverberating consequences for the company’s many ventures, not to mention clean energy tech research and development writ large.

Tesla has been failing to meet its forecasts for a while now, even with projections much reduced to reflect the current policy atmosphere. For two consecutive financial quarters, the company’s vehicle deliveries have fallen short of 400,000. Bloomberg reports that “Tesla Inc. is in trouble,” adding that “having promised a revolutionary new automated product for a decade, missing repeated deadlines, the company finally launched a limited, somewhat automated pilot that looks years behind the competition.”

While the company’s electric vehicle sales numbers have been dismal since the middle of last year, the company has had at least one bright spot of growth in its portfolio – its energy storage business. Between 2020 and 2024, revenue derived from energy storage and solar installations ballooned from $2 billion to $10.1 billion. But even this business is not immune to the pall cast over the company. Deployments of its Powerwall and Megapack stationary storage products have declined in the first two quarters of this year.

On Monday, Tesla’s stock tumbled 7.5% in a single morning as the (in)famous founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced that he will be forming his own political party. This move comes on the heels of a frenzied period of collaboration followed by a high-profile fracas with President Donald Trump. Investors are clearly worried about Musk’s behavior, and the stock market is reflecting that defection.

“Very simply, Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, recently told The Guardian. He added that there is a “broader sense of exhaustion” among Tesla investors stemming from Musk’s repeated and divisive involvement in the political sphere.

Ironically, Musk’s company has been kneecapped by the very same political party and policy initiatives that Musk himself helped spearhead in the initial months of the Trump presidency. While Musk stood with his arms folded in the Oval Office, his company was releasing statements against Trump’s proposed end to clean energy tax credits, writing on X (also owned by Musk) that “abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

The current administration’s approach to clean energy subsidies and international trade amount to a whole lot of bad news for nearly all of Tesla’s portfolio, including energy storage. “While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim,” reports Tech Crunch. Like so many other domestic clean energy supply chains, the lion’s share of raw materials are sourced from China, which dominates global critical mineral refining.

Musk is now publicly distancing himself from Trump, but the damage is already done. The bottom is about to fall out of electric vehicle sales thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, a (highly predictable) outcome which Musk realized “too late.”

The impact of the bill on domestic clean energy, energy storage, and other major growth sectors in global energy markets are likely to hit American consumers hard, potentially “setting America up for the worst energy-affordability crisis since the 1970s.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk is still the richest person on planet earth, by a comfortable margin.

We discussed the version of the bill that passed in the House in May (the House bill) in our previous update. On July 1, the Senate passed the OBBBA, which was then passed in the House on July 3 and signed into law by the president on July 4.

The OBBBA includes significant changes to the timing and availability of several clean energy tax credits, including the clean energy ITC (CEITC) and PTC (CEPTC), the clean hydrogen PTC, the advanced manufacturing credit, and the zero-emission nuclear PTC, as well as restrictions related to foreign entities applicable to such credits and to the carbon capture sequestration credit. The OBBBA includes various timeframes for grandfathering renewable energy projects from such changes.

A chart of key dates for solar, wind, and battery projects under the OBBBA can be downloaded here.

Key Changes

This alert focuses on issues of particular significance to the energy industry and the timeframes for beginning construction before the relevant effective dates and is not intended to be comprehensive. Four key changes discussed below include:

Accelerated phase-out of various clean energy tax credits;

New restrictions related to foreign entities of concern (FEOC);

Adoption of existing beginning of construction guidance for purposes of the FEOC restrictions; and

Denial of CEITC and CEPTC for small wind leasing arrangements.

Accelerated Phase-Out/Sunset of CEPTC, CEITC, Clean Hydrogen PTC, and Advanced Manufacturing Credits

Sections 45Y (the CEPTC) and 48E (the CEITC)

For solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after enactment), the OBBBA phases out the CEPTC and CEITC for projects placed in service after 2027.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the phase-out period for the CEPTC and the CEITC for all projects (including solar and wind) would have occurred over three calendar years, commencing upon the later of 2032 and the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production have been reduced by 75% from 2022 levels.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The one-year ""beginning of construction"" standard is much more accommodating than both the 60-day standard in the House bill and the ""date of enactment"" standard in an early draft of the OBBBA in the Senate. The early draft of the OBBBA in the Senate also included an excise tax that applied to solar and wind projects based on use of foreign materials, which is no longer included in the OBBBA. We note that the 2027 placed in service deadline is unlikely to apply to many utility-scale solar and wind projects given typical project development timelines.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The final OBBBA does not include the elimination of five-year MACRS for CEITC and CEPTC property that was included in early drafts of the Senate bill.

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen PTC)

The OBBBA accelerates the phase-out for the clean hydrogen PTC by revising the beginning of construction deadline to January 1, 2028.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the beginning of construction deadline for the clean hydrogen PTC was January 1, 2033.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: It may be more challenging for clean hydrogen projects to meet the beginning of construction deadline than wind or solar projects, given that the industry is still nascent and many developers are not yet able to procure significant equipment. However, the December 31, 2027, deadline is much more accommodating than the House bill, which included a December 31, 2025, deadline.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credits)

The Section 45X advanced manufacturing credit applies different credit rates to the production of different eligible components.

For tax years beginning after enactment, the OBBBA modifies the relevant phase-out and termination dates for certain types of eligible components and the requirements for battery modules.

Metallurgical coal was added as an applicable critical mineral, but the advanced manufacturing credit rate is only 2.5% (as opposed to the 10% rate for other applicable critical minerals).

For applicable critical minerals (except for metallurgical coal), the OBBBA adds a phase-out that begins in 2031 (prior law included no phase-out or termination for critical minerals). The OBBBA terminates the credit for wind energy components and metallurgical coal. For wind energy components, the advanced manufacturing credit is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. For metallurgical coal, the advanced manufacturing credit is terminated for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the phase-out period for the advanced manufacturing credit was set to begin in 2030 for eligible components other than critical minerals, with the complete phase-out for components sold after 2032.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The accelerated phase-out for wind components is consistent with the Administration's other policies, including a presidential memorandum targeting wind energy and an order to stop work on the Empire Wind 1 Project.

Finally, the term ""battery module"" was modified to clarify that battery modules are comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Restrictions on Foreign Entities and Investors

The OBBBA includes complex restrictions related to relationships with or assistance from certain FEOCs, which apply to the CEITC, CEPTC, the Section 45Q carbon capture sequestration credit, the Section 45U nuclear PTC, and the advanced manufacturing credit.

For taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, no such credit is available if the facility is owned by a ""specified foreign entity"" (SFE). An SFE is defined in the OBBBA to include specifically identified threats to the security of the U.S., Chinese military companies operating in the U.S., entities subject to Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act restrictions, and battery-producing entities eligible for Department of Defense contracts as identified by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: This definition includes Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL), BYD Company, Envision Energy, EVE Energy Company, Gotion High Tech Company, and Hithium Energy Storage Company, thus impacting significantly all battery energy storage systems.

SFEs also include foreign-controlled entities. An entity will generally be a ""foreign-controlled entity"" only if it is owned more than 50% by entities or individuals with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.

In addition, for taxable years beginning after two years after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, no credit is allowed under Section 45U if the facility is owned by a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (FIE). Further, no credit is allowed under Section 45Q, Section 45X, Section 45Y, and Section 48E for any taxable year beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA if the facility is owned by an FIE. An FIE is one that satisfies one of two tests: first, one of the following conditions must be met during the applicable taxable year: (i) an SFE has authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate 40% or more of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more SFEs. Second, during the previous taxable year, the entity must have made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement which entitles such SFE (or an entity related to such SFE) to exercise control over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer) or (ii) with respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (a) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (b) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

Effectively controlled entities are ineligible for credits. For purposes of defining an FIE, the OBBBA broadens the definition of effective control to encompass licensing agreements and related contractual arrangements with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible facility where (i) a contractual counterparty retains any of the following rights to: (A) control sourcing of components and subcomponents, (B) direct operations, (C) restrict the taxpayer's use of intellectual property, (D) receive royalties beyond 10 years of a licensing or similar agreement, (E) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into service agreements exceeding two years, (ii) such agreement fails to provide the licensee with the technical data and know-how necessary to produce an eligible component independently, without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or an SFE, or (iii) such agreement was entered into after the date of enactment. However, the OBBBA carves out the bona fide purchase and sale of intellectual property from the restrictions, excluding purchases where the intellectual property reverts after a period of time.

The OBBBA provides that the Secretary shall issue such guidance with respect to the FIE provisions no later than December 31, 2026.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: If read literally, the practical effect of the ""entered into after the date of enactment"" standard is that any licensing agreements executed after July 4, 2025 are deemed to provide the licensee with effective control.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The OBBBA's omission of the FEOC rules from Section 48 means that geothermal heat pump property that begins construction before January 1, 2035, will not be subject to the FEOC rules if the Section 48 ITC is claimed with respect to such property.

In addition to the ownership-related restrictions described above, new project-level restrictions prevent facilities from being eligible for the CEITC, CEPTC, or advanced manufacturing credits if they begin construction after the end of 2025 (or, in the case of the advanced manufacturing credits in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, if an eligible component is used in a product sold before January 1, 2027) and receive ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" (PFE). A PFE is an SFE or an FIE. The term ""material assistance"" from a PFE means that, with respect to any property, a facility has a ""material assistance cost ratio"" that is less than the applicable threshold percentage.

With respect to any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the threshold percentage is 40% in the case of a qualified facility that begins construction in 2026 and is 55% in the case of energy storage technology that begins construction in 2026. The threshold percentage increases 5% each year through 2029. The ""material assistance cost ratio"" for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to (i) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology other than the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products (including components) that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, divided by (ii) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) that are incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology.

The OBBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables to identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or eligible component that is attributable to a PFE and to provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE no later than December 31, 2026. Prior to the issuance of such safe harbor tables, taxpayers may use the tables included in Notice 2025-08 to establish the percentage of the total direct material costs of any listed eligible component and any manufactured product, and rely on a certification by the supplier of the manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent of an eligible component regarding (i) the total direct costs or the total direct material costs, as applicable, of such product or component that was not produced or manufactured by a PFE, or (ii) that such product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: While compliance with the material assistance ratio may not be as burdensome for taxpayers developing projects with domestic content strategies, the compliance burden may be more significant for projects without such strategies in place.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: Certain suppliers may be reluctant to provide certifications since violations of the material assistance ratio resulting from misrepresentations can result a penalty to the person that provides the certification.

Taxpayers may elect to exclude costs from the material assistance cost ratio with respect to a product, component, element, material, or subcomponent that is (i) acquired, manufactured, or assembled pursuant to a binding written contract with a PFE that was entered into before June 16, 2025, and (ii) placed in service before 2030 (or before 2028, in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The material assistance ratio is expected to impact nearly all major suppliers of battery storage systems and solar modules.

The OBBBA amends the recapture rules for the CEITC to provide that payments to FEOCs result in recapture of the CEITC. However, unlike the normal ITC recapture rules, this FEOC recapture rule applies during the 10-year period beginning at placed in service, and results in 100% recapture at all points during that period.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The recapture rule for the CEITC is stricter than the FIE disallowance discussed above as applied to the CEPTC because an applicable payment to an SFE results in the recapture of the entire CEITC. With respect to the CEPTC, such a payment results in the disallowance of the CEPTC for the taxable year following the payment.

Adoption of Existing Beginning of Construction Guidance for Purposes of the FEOC Restrictions

For purposes of the FEOC restrictions, the OBBBA provides that the beginning of construction date is determined pursuant to rules similar to Notice 2013-29 and Notice 2018-59 as well as any subsequently issued guidance in effect on January 1, 2025.

Additionally, the OBBBA directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations and guidance to prevent the circumvention of the FEOC restrictions. Further, on July 7, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury to issue new guidance to ensure that policies concerning the ""beginning of construction"" are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: Taxpayers may find it helpful that the OBBBA adopts a familiar standard for the beginning of construction given the longstanding application of the beginning of construction guidance. However, the anti-circumvention rule and executive order indicate the IRS may change the standard to take a more prohibitive approach.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: For existing ""beginning of construction"" guidance, please see our prior analysis on Notices 2013-29, 2013-60, 2014-46, 2015-25, 2016-31, 2017-04, 2018-59, 2019-43, 2020-41, and 2021-41.

Denial of Credit for Expenditures for Small Wind Leasing Arrangements

The OBBBA denies the CEITC or CEPTC to solar water heating and wind generation property if the taxpayer rents such property to a third party. Unlike the House bill, solar electric property is not included in the list of prohibited property. Accordingly, residential solar electric property that is leased to customers remains eligible for the CEITC and CEPTC.

Conclusion

As enacted, the OBBBA provides substantive rules and transition rules that are significantly more favorable to the industry than interim versions of the bill that had been proposed. Because certain of the more unfavorable provisions in the OBBBA do not apply to projects that ""begin construction"" as of certain dates, it is essential to consider and implement ""beginning of construction"" strategies for applicable projects as soon as possible.

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.","President Trump signed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (the “OBBB”) into law on July 4, 2025. Congress passed the legislation using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the 60-vote Senate filibuster. In addition to making many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, the bill makes significant changes to many of the clean energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Projects that began construction before 2025 and are planning on claiming production tax credits (“PTCs”) or investment tax credits (“ITCs”) under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. However, the OBBB is a mixed bag when it comes to the other energy tax credits that were introduced or extended by the IRA. The OBBB makes substantial cuts to the tech-neutral tax credits for solar and wind and eliminates certain other energy tax credits (e.g., those for hydrogen, EVs and homeowners), but other technologies and activities (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, nuclear, clean fuel production) experienced fewer claw backs of the benefits provided by the IRA. The OBBB also adds foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions to the surviving energy tax credits. Finally, the OBBB expands the definition of “qualifying income” (“QI”) for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) under section 7704(d)(1)(E).

While a prior version of the OBBB released by the Senate contained an excise tax on certain wind and solar facilities deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”), the tax was removed shortly before its passage by the Senate and is not included in the OBBB.

On July 7, 2025, President Trump also issued an Executive Order (Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources) (the “EO”) directing the Secretary of the Treasury to, within 45 days of enactment of the OBBB, “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” The EO specifically directs Treasury to issue new and revised guidance on “beginning of construction” (BOC), and notes that broad safe harbors should not apply “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” In the same 45-day window, Treasury is also directed to implement the FEOC restrictions in the OBBB.

Below is a summary of the key changes for the clean energy industry as a result of the enactment of the OBBB.

I. TAX CREDIT AND DEDUCTION MODIFICATIONS

1. Sections 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credits when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

PIS DEADLINE: Adds a placed in service (PIS) deadline for solar and wind facilities of December 31, 2027.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (e., more than 12 months after the enactment of OBBB).

Akin Note: Allowing construction to begin for up to one year after enactment was a late change to OBBB. However, taxpayers’ ability to take advantage of this window may be limited as a result of guidance to be issued by Treasury implementing the EO.]

Statute makes clear that batteries are not impacted by this change. Other facilities that qualify for credits under §§ 45Y and 48E (besides solar and wind facilities) are also not impacted.

[Akin Note: The language making clear that batteries are not impacted by this change is arguably not necessary in light of the Treasury position in regulations that energy storage technologies cannot be part of qualified facilities.]

LEASING DISALLOWANCE: Disallows credits for solar electric heating and small wind residential property if the taxpayer rents or leases the property.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., after enactment of the OBBB).

[Akin Note: In earlier versions of OBBB, this rule also applied to residential photovoltaic solar systems. The final enacted version of OBBB does not disallow ITCs or PTCs for residential photovoltaic solar systems.]

PHASEOUT TIMELINE: Sets both §§ 45Y and 48E to begin phasing out in 2032.

Except for solar and wind facilities that have a special PIS deadline (see above), facilities that qualify for either §§ 45Y or 48E and:

BOC before 2034 can access the full credit;

BOC in 2034 can access 75% of the credit;

BOC 2035 can access 50% of the credit; and

BOC after 2035 cannot access either credit.

TAX OWNERSHIP OF GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS: For purposes of determining tax ownership geothermal heat pumps for depreciation and tax credit purposes, the fact that such property is not readily usable by anyone other than the lessee or offtaker is disregarded.

[Akin Note: This point removes a key obstacle to allowing geothermal heat pumps to be subject to “third party ownership” structures which more readily allows for tax equity financing.]

FUEL CELL FACILITIES (§ 48E (ITC) only): Removes requirement that the anticipated greenhouse gas emission rate not be greater than zero for fuel cell facilities.

Changes apply to facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Sets a 30% ITC rate without the ability to increase with adders and apparently without needing to satisfy Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements.

NUCLEAR ENERGY COMMUNITY (§ 45Y (PTC) only): Creates an energy community adder based on local employment in nuclear facilities, nuclear R&D, and nuclear component manufacturing.

DOMESTIC CONTENT (§ 48E (ITC) only): Facilities that begin construction on and after June 16, 2025, are subject to the same domestic content thresholds for the ITC as the PTC.

Domestic content thresholds are 45% for BOC in 2025, 50% for BOC in 2026 and 55% for BOC in 2027+ (separate rates still apply for off-shore wind).

[Akin Note: This change corrects what has long been viewed as a typo or glitch in the statutory framework.]

Facilities that began construction before June 16, 2024, can utilize a 40% threshold.

2. Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT EXTENSION: Extends the deadline to sell eligible fuel from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2029.

EMISSIONS RATES: Disallows emissions rates from being negative, excludes indirect land use changes from the lifecycle analysis, and requires Treasury to provide emissions rates for each specific animal manure feedstock.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

[Akin Note: Many clean fuels producers were hoping to be able to generate multiples of the statutory credit rate as a result of their fuel having negative emissions rates. This change eliminates this possibility, which had previously been implied by other statutory language that contemplated negative emissions rates.]

FEEDSTOCK SOURCING: Requires feedstock to be produced or grown exclusively in the United Stated, Mexico or Canada.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

Disallows any feedstock sources that already generated a 45Z credit but includes a directive to Treasury to issue regulations or guidance to implement this anti-double counting rule.

RELATED PARTY SALES: Directs Treasury to expand the rule allowing sales between related parties prior to a sale to an unrelated party.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL: Eliminates the increased credit rate of $1.75/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but the standard $1.00/gallon rate remains available for SAF.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.

Applies to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB), and to fuel sold or used before such date if claims for the § 6426(k) excise tax credit have not been paid or allowed as of such date.

3. Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT RATES: Equalizes the credit rate for all potential disposal pathways (g., EOR, secure geologic storage and utilization) to $17/MT (indexed for inflation after 2026).

Rate is $36/MT for direct air capture.

Applies to facilities PIS after July 4, 2025 (e., after the date of the enactment of OBBB).

4. Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

SALE OF INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: No credit for the sale of integrated components unless certain requirements are satisfied.

Applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

To the extent an eligible component (called a “primary component”) is incorporated into another eligible component (called a “secondary component”) prior to sale to an unrelated person, a 45X credit is allowed with respect to the primary component only if:

The secondary component is produced in the same manufacturing facility as the primary component; and

At least 65% of the total direct material costs of the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States.

PHASEOUT FOR WIND ENERGY COMPONENTS: Wind energy components, sold after December 31, 2027, no longer generate a 45X credit.

PHASEOUT FOR CRITICAL MINERALS: Adds a phaseout for applicable critical minerals produced after 2030 based on timing of production.

ADDITION OF METALLURGICAL COAL: Metallurgical coal added as an applicable critical mineral.

Defined as “metallurgical coal which is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the notice published by the Department of Energy entitled ‘Critical Material list; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking’ (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))), regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.”

Generates credit at a special rate of 2.5% of costs (as opposed to 10% for other critical minerals).

Applies only to metallurgical coal produced before December 31, 2029.

REVISED DEFINITION OF BATTERY MODULE: Definition of “battery module” is updated to include a requirement for the module to include “all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.”

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., taxable years beginning after the enactment of OBBB).

5. Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT TERMINATION: Terminates credit for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2032.

6. Terminated Credits and Deductions

SECTION 45V (CLEAN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT): The deadline for beginning construction under §45V is moved up to December 31, 2027 (instead of December 31, 2032).

EV RELATED CREDITS: Credits for EVs and EV charging property are eliminated.

The deadlines for acquiring an eligible vehicle under §§ 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit), 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), and 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit) are moved up to September 30, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

The deadline for PIS under § 30C (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property) is moved up to June 30, 2026 (instead of December 31, 2032).

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.

The PIS deadline for residential clean energy property under § 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit) of December 31, 2034, is replaced with a deadline for incurring expenditures of December 31, 2025.

The deadline for PIS for energy efficiency improvements, residential energy property expenditures and home energy audits under § 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) is December 31, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

REPEAL OF 5-YEAR MACRS: Removes the ability to utilize 5-year MACRS schedules under § 168 for “energy property” described in § 48.

Property eligible for a credit under §§ 45Y and 48E would remain eligible for 5-year MACRS.

ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DEDUCTION: Deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is eliminated by adding a new BOC deadline of June 30, 2026.

II. NEW FEOC RESTRICTIONS

1. Key Definitions

PROHIBITED FOREIGN ENTITY (“PFE”): Means any “Specified Foreign Entity” or “Foreign-Influenced Entity”.

Generally, determination is made as of the last day of each taxable year.

For the first taxable year beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB), determination is made as of the first date of such taxable year (except with respect to status as a “Foreign-Controlled Entity”).

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITY (“SFE”): A “specified foreign entity” means:

a foreign entity of concern described in subparagraph (A), (B), (D), or (E) of section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283; 15 U.S.C. 4651),

an entity included on a list required by clause (i), (ii), (iv), (iv) of section 2(d)(2)(B) of Public Law 117-78 (135 Stat. 1527),

a foreign-controlled entity.

FOREIGN-CONTROLLED ENTITY:

A “foreign-controlled entity” means:

the government (including any level of government below the national level) of a covered nation;

an agency or instrumentality of a government described in the immediately preceding bullet;

a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, provided that such person is not an individual who is a citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident of the United States;

an entity or a qualified business unit (as defined in § 989(a)) incorporated or organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation; or

other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity (including subsidiary entities) controlled by an entity described in the foregoing bullets.

For purposes of this definition, “control” means, (i) in the case of a corporation, ownership (by vote or value) of more than 50% of the stock of such corporation, (ii) in the case of a partnership, ownership of more than 50% of the profits interests or capital interests in such partnership, or (iii) in any other case, ownership of more than 50% of the beneficial interests in the entity.

For purposes of this definition, “covered nation” has the same meaning given such term under 10 U.S.C. 4872(f)(2) (e., means the Democratic People’s republic of North Korea, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic of Iran).

FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITY (“FIE”):

Other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity with respect to which, during the taxable year,

A specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer of such entity,

“Covered Officer” means, with respect to an entity: (i) a member of the board of directors, board of supervisors, or equivalent governing body; (ii) an executive-level officer, including the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, or senior vice president; or (iii) an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or members described in the foregoing bullets.

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity,

One or more specified foreign entities own, in the aggregate, at least 40% of such entity, or

At least 15% of the debt of such entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more specified foreign entities, or

Which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity (or an entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise effective control over:

Any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), or

With respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (i) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (ii) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

The term “taxpayer” for purposes of the FIE rules includes any person related to the taxpayer.

ATTRIBUTION RULE: For purposes of the definition of a PFE (and the subsidiary definitions), ownership is determined by taking into account the attribution rules under § 318(a)(2) for purposes of determining ownership of stock in a corporation and with similar principles being applied for non-corporate entities.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL:

“Effective Control” means one or more agreements or arrangements similar to those described in the following bullets (relating to determination prior to the issuance of guidance and licensing arrangements) which provide one or more contractual counterparties of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held which are described in the definition of “foreign-influenced entity”.

During any period prior to the date that guidance has been issued by Treasury, the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to:

Determine the quantity determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

Determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer or the storage of electrical energy in energy storage technology of the taxpayer;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

Restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty; or

On an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity, or

With respect to a licensing agreement for the provision of intellectual property (or any other contract, agreement or other arrangement entered into with a contractual counterparty related to such licensing agreement) with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component:

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to limit the taxpayer’s utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions thereof);

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions thereof);

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity; or

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

BEGINNING OF CONSTRUCTION (BOC):

Generally, determined pursuant to rules similar to rules under IRS Notice 2013-29 and IRS Notice 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

Treasury is directed to prescribed regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of the subparagraph relating to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, including the prevention of any evasion with respect to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio “where the fact demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.”

2. Credit Disallowance

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITIES AND FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITIES: Prevents “Specified Foreign Entities” and “Foreign-Influenced Entities” from claiming the credit.

SFE restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

Credits Impacted: §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Z, 45Q, 45X, and 45U.

FIE restriction applies to:

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB) for §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Q, and 45X.

“Effective Control” is carved out from the FIE restriction for §§ 45Y, 48E and 45X.

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 for §§ 45Z and 45U.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL: Prevents taxpayers subject to “effective control” by a “specified foreign entity” for a given taxable year from claiming credits if the effective control determination was made with respect to a qualified facility, an energy storage technology, or an eligible component (as applicable).

Applies to §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Credits under §§ 45X ,45Y and 48E are disallowed if the taxpayer receives material assistance from a PFE.

Applies to facilities that BOC after December 31, 2025, for §§ 45Y and 48E.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, for § 45X.

Determination of whether the taxpay received “material assistance” is discussed below in Section II.3.

APPLICABLE PAYMENTS: For any ITC allowed in a taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 (e., after two years following the enactment of OBBB), recapture of 100% of any allowed ITC is required if an “applicable payment” (defined by cross-reference to payments that trigger “effective control”) is made to a “Prohibited Foreign Entity” within 10-years of placement in service of the facility.

3. Material Assistance

CALCULATION OF RATIO: Requires calculation of a percentage, the numerator of which is direct costs not attributable to PFEs and the denominator of which is all direct costs.

For Qualifying Facilities and Energy Storage Technologies under §§ 45Y and 48E, the calculation focuses on Manufactured Products (including components) and can be expressed as:

For eligible components under § 45X, the calculation focuses on direct material costs related to the production of eligible components and can be expressed as:

QUALIFIED FACILITIES AND ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY (§45Y/§48E): Requires an increasing amount of a facility’s manufactured products NOT to be manufactured by PFEs based on the beginning of construction date of the qualified facility or energy storage technology. This calculation is called the “Material Assistance Cost Ratio”.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Material Assistance Cost Ratio calculations include qualified interconnection property (as defined in §48E(b)(4)).

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Qualified Facilities:

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Energy Storage Technology:

ELIGIBLE COMPONENTS (§45X): Requires an increasing amount of an eligible component’s direct material costs NOT to be mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs based on the year the eligible component is sold.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after the enactment of OBBB).

Solar Energy Components:

Wind Energy Components:

Battery Components:

Critical Minerals*:

*Subject to increase by Treasury no later than December 31, 2027, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs and national security concerns

GUIDANCE ON CALCULATION: Prior to promulgation of new guidance from Treasury (required by December 31, 2026), for purposes of calculating the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, the statute permits reliance on:

IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to certain safe harbors for domestic content adder calculations), but scope of such reliance is not yet clear; and

[Akin Note: This guidance only applies to §§ 45Y and 48E projects, and thus there is no current guidance for calculation of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio in the context of § 45X credits.

4. Audit and Penalty Provisions

EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Extends the statute of limitations from three to six years for assessing deficiencies related to the material assistance rules.

REDUCED PENALTY THRESHOLD: Reduces the threshold from 10% to 1% for the threshold to assess penalties related to a substantial understatement of income tax if the cause is an overstatement of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio with respect to the determination of credits under §§ 45Y, 48E or 45X.

NEW SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION PENALTY: Creates a new penalty based on inaccurate supplier certifications that result in a disallowance of credit.

Penalty applies where:

the certifying person knew or reasonably should have known that (A) the certification was inaccurate and (B) the certification would be used in connection with a credit determination; and

the disallowance exceeds the lesser of (x) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year to be shown on the return and (y) $100,000.

Penalty is the greater of (x) 10% of the underpayment and (y) $5,000.

In executive order, Trump delivers on promise to ‘deal with’ wind and solar In an executive order on Monday, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” restricting which projects will still qualify for wind and solar tax credits.","Copper traders and producers have anticipated tariffs on copper since Trump announced in February that his administration would investigate the national security implications of copper imports, calling the metal an “essential material for national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience.”

Trump has already imposed tariffs for similarly strategically and economically important metals such as steel and aluminum. The process for imposing these tariffs under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 involves a finding by the Secretary of Commerce that the product being tariffed is essential to national security, and thus that the United States should be able to supply it on its own.

Copper has been referred to as the “metal of electrification” because of its centrality to a broad array of electrical technologies, including transmission lines, batteries, and electric motors. Electric vehicles contain around 180 pounds of copper on average. “Copper, scrap copper, and copper’s derivative products play a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, including clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics,” the White House said in February.

Copper prices had risen around 25% this year through Monday. Prices for copper futures jumped by as much as 17% after the tariff announcement and are currently trading at around $5.50 a pound.

The tariffs, when implemented, could provide renewed impetus to expand copper mining in the United States. But tariffs can happen in a matter of months. A copper mine takes years to open — and that’s if investors decide to put the money toward the project in the first place. Congress took a swipe at the electric vehicle market in the U.S. last week, extinguishing subsidies for both consumers and manufacturers as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. That will undoubtedly shrink domestic demand for EV inputs like copper, which could make investors nervous about sinking years and dollars into new or expanded copper mines.

Even if the Trump administration succeeds in its efforts to accelerate permitting for and construction of new copper mines, the copper will need to be smelted and refined before it can be used, and China dominates the copper smelting and refining industry.

The U.S. produced just over 1.1 million tons of copper in 2023, with 850,000 tons being mined from ore and the balance recycled from scrap, according to United States Geological Survey data. It imported almost 900,000 tons.

With the prospect of tariffs driving up prices for domestically mined ore, the immediate beneficiaries are those who already have mines. Shares in Freeport-McMoRan, which operates seven copper mines in Arizona and New Mexico, were up over 4.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

More than 100 people — many of them children — ultimately died as extreme rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise 34 feet in 90 minutes. But the tragedy was “not really a failure of meteorology,” UCLA and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources climate scientist Daniel Swain said during a public “Office Hours” review of the disaster on Monday. The National Weather Service in San Antonio and Austin first warned the public of the potential for heavy rain on Sunday, June 29 — five days before the floods crested. The agency followed that with a flood watch warning for the Kerrville area on Thursday, July 3, then issued an additional 21 warnings, culminating just after 1 a.m. on Friday, July 4, with a wireless emergency alert sent to the phones of residents, campers, and RVers along the Guadalupe River.

The NWS alerts were both timely and accurate, and even correctly predicted an expected rainfall rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour. If it were possible to consider the science alone, the official response might have been deemed a success.

Of all the storm systems, convective storms — like thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, and extreme rainstorms — are some of the most difficult to forecast. “We don’t have very good observations of some of these fine-scale weather extremes,” Swain told me after office hours were over, in reference to severe meteorological events that are often relatively short-lived and occur in small geographic areas. “We only know a tornado occurred, for example, if people report it and the Weather Service meteorologists go out afterward and look to see if there’s a circular, radial damage pattern.” A hurricane, by contrast, spans hundreds of miles and is visible from space.

Global weather models, which predict conditions at a planetary scale, are relatively coarse in their spatial resolution and “did not do the best job with this event,” Swain said during his office hours. “They predicted some rain, locally heavy, but nothing anywhere near what transpired.” (And before you ask — artificial intelligence-powered weather models were among the worst at predicting the Texas floods.)

Over the past decade or so, however, due to the unique convective storm risks in the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other meteorological agencies have developed specialized high resolution convection-resolving models to better represent and forecast extreme thunderstorms and rainstorms.

NOAA’s cutting-edge specialized models “got this right,” Swain told me of the Texas storms. “Those were the models that alerted the local weather service and the NOAA Weather Prediction Center of the potential for an extreme rain event. That is why the flash flood watches were issued so early, and why there was so much advanced knowledge.”

Writing for The Eyewall, meteorologist Matt Lanza concurred with Swain’s assessment: “By Thursday morning, the [high resolution] model showed as much as 10 to 13 inches in parts of Texas,” he wrote. “By Thursday evening, that was as much as 20 inches. So the [high resolution] model upped the ante all day.”

To be any more accurate than they ultimately were on the Texas floods, meteorologists would have needed the ability to predict the precise location and volume of rainfall of an individual thunderstorm cell. Although models can provide a fairly accurate picture of the general area where a storm will form, the best current science still can’t achieve that level of precision more than a few hours in advance of a given event.

Climate change itself is another factor making storm behavior even less predictable. “If it weren’t so hot outside, if it wasn’t so humid, if the atmosphere wasn’t holding all that water, then [the system] would have rained and marched along as the storm drifted,” Claudia Benitez-Nelson, an expert on flooding at the University of South Carolina, told me. Instead, slow and low prevailing winds caused the system to stall, pinning it over the same worst-case-scenario location at the confluence of the Hill Country rivers for hours and challenging the limits of science and forecasting.

Though it’s tempting to blame the Trump administration cuts to the staff and budget of the NWS for the tragedy, the local NWS actually had more forecasters on hand than usual in its local field office ahead of the storm, in anticipation of potential disaster. Any budget cuts to the NWS, while potentially disastrous, would not go into effect until fiscal year 2026.

The proposed 2026 budget for NOAA, however, would zero out the upkeep of the models, as well as shutter the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, which studies thunderstorms and rainstorms, such as the one in Texas. And due to the proprietary, U.S.-specific nature of the high-resolution models, there is no one coming to our rescue if they’re eliminated or degraded by the cuts.

The impending cuts are alarming to the scientists charged with maintaining and adjusting the models to ensure maximum accuracy, too. Computationally, it’s no small task to keep them running 24 hours a day, every day of the year. A weather model doesn’t simply run on its own indefinitely, but rather requires large data transfers as well as intakes of new conditions from its network of observation stations to remain reliable. Although the NOAA high-resolution models have been in use for about a decade, yearly updates keep the programs on the cutting edge of weather science; without constant tweaks, the models’ accuracy slowly degrades as the atmosphere changes and information and technologies become outdated.

It’s difficult to imagine that the Texas floods could have been more catastrophic, and yet the NOAA models and NWS warnings and alerts undoubtedly saved lives. Still, local Texas authorities have attempted to pass the blame, claiming they weren’t adequately informed of the dangers by forecasters. The picture will become clearer as reporting continues to probe why the flood-prone region did not have warning sirens, why camp counselors did not have their phones to receive overnight NWS alarms, why there were not more flood gauges on the rivers, and what, if anything, local officials could have done to save more people. Still, given what is scientifically possible at this stage of modeling, “This was not a forecast failure relative to scientific or weather prediction best practices. That much is clear,” Swain said.

As the climate warms and extreme rainfall events increase as a result, however, it will become ever more crucial to have access to cutting-edge weather models. “What I want to bring attention to is that this is not a one-off,” Benitez-Nelson, the flood expert at the University of South Carolina, told me. “There’s this temptation to say, ‘Oh, it’s a 100-year storm, it’s a 1,000-year storm.’”

“No,” she went on. “This is a growing pattern.”

2. 17% of the continental U.S. now has restrictions or bans on wind and solar development: Heatmap analysis

The development of new wind and solar power plants is “now heavily restricted or outright banned in about one in five counties across the country,” according to a major new survey of public records and local ordinances by my colleagues Robinson Meyer and Charlie Clynes. Their report found bans and restrictions — such as a rule that wind turbines must be placed a certain number of miles from homes, or that solar farms cannot take up more than 1% of a county’s agricultural land — in a total of 605 U.S. counties, including at least 59 municipalities in the more-renewables-friendly Northeast. In total, the bans and restrictions on renewables cover approximately 17% of the continental United States’ total land mass.

Robinson and Charlie’s findings have not been previously reported, and their research involved calling thousands of counties where laws, in some cases, were not in existing public databases. You can access the full project- and county-level data and associated risk assessments via Heatmap Pro, here.

3. In executive order, Trump delivers on promise to ‘deal with’ wind and solar

In an executive order on Monday, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” restricting which projects will still qualify for wind and solar tax credits. The order builds on the repeal of renewable energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which had stipulated that such projects would need to begin construction within a year and come online by 2028 to be eligible for the subsidies. Now the government will take a stricter approach to defining “the beginning of construction” to prevent “the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” by limiting credits to projects in which “a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Freedom Caucus members had described the tax credits as a sticking point during their late negotiations over the bill. As my colleagues Jael Holzman and Katie Brigham previously reported, North Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman alluded to a conversation with Trump in which the president had assured him that he was “going to deal with [the tax credits] in his own way.” It appears the executive order is the follow-through on that promise. Additionally, Trump’s executive order called for the Department of the Interior to determine whether any of its policies, practices, or regulations “provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources” and revise them accordingly.

4. DOE resource report warns of blackouts, ‘overreliance on intermittent energy sources’

An Energy Department report released Monday warned that blackouts in the U.S. could “increase by 100% in 2030” if the country continues to close its coal and natural gas power plants. The report, completed at the direction of an April executive order by President Trump, anticipates 209 gigawatts of new generation by 2030 to replace 104 gigawatts of retirements — but “only 22 gigawatts would come from firm baseload generation sources,” so that, “even assuming no retirements, the model found increased risk of outages in 2030 by a factor of 34.” The DOE concluded that the U.S. grid “will not be able to sustain the combined impact of coal and other plant closures, an overreliance on intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, and data center growth, highlighting the urgency of increasing dispatchable energy output.”

The DOE’s report sets the stage for the department to continue to prevent the phase-out of old fossil fuel power plants and open new facilities. Many are skeptical of the agency’s logic, however, pointing to renewable-heavy grid success stories like Texas. The Department of Energy “appears to exaggerate the risk of blackouts and undervalue the contributions of entire resource classes, like wind, solar, and battery storage,” Caitlin Marquis, the managing director at Advanced Energy United, said, per Axios.

5. Trump threatens South Korea, Japan with 25% tariffs

On Monday, the Trump administration sent letters to 14 countries warning them they’ll face tariffs of up to 40% if they don’t reach a trade deal with the U.S. by an August 1 deadline. Significantly, automaking giants Japan and South Korea — which each account for about 4% of U.S. imports, per The New York Times — were among the recipients, and face 25% tariffs according to the letters. As my colleague Jael Holzman previously reported, Japan in particular had been “positioned to be an ally in U.S. efforts to wean off China-linked minerals and signed a minerals trade agreement under Biden,” with the imposition of such tariffs potentially threatening to tank America’s own “mineral supply chain renaissance.”

Chemical Lobby’s Delay Tactics Rejected, but EPA Must Remain Vigilant to Protect Public Health from Asbestos Hazards

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a significant and overdue course correction, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has withdrawn its plan to rewrite or delay the Biden-era ban on chrysotile asbestos, the last form of asbestos still legally in use in the United States. This shift comes after widespread public criticism and mounting pressure from health advocates, scientists and environmental justice leaders demanding that the agency prioritize lives over lobbyists.

Just weeks ago, EPA signaled its intent to stall this life-saving regulation, in what appeared to be a direct concession to chemical industry interests. At the center of that maneuver was a court filing by Lynn Ann Dekleva, Deputy Assistant Administrator for EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and a former policy director at the American Chemistry Council, the trade group whose members stand to profit from regulatory rollbacks.

That move would have suspended the asbestos ban for years, prolonging exposure to a known carcinogen responsible for an estimated 40,000 deaths annually in the United States. The reversal represents a hard-won reprieve, but the original filing and its motivations reveal a disturbing pattern of regulatory capture and political interference.

“While the withdrawal of this delay is a step in the right direction, it was never voluntary. The agency moved only after facing fierce public pressure and legal accountability,” said Michelle Roos, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Network. “Let’s be clear: the original decision to delay this ban was a gift to chemical lobbyists, not a science-based policy choice. One down, 30 to go. This is just the beginning of the public backlash against the Trump administration’s plans to roll back 31 standards that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.”

In formal comments submitted to EPA in June 2024, the Environmental Protection Network endorsed the agency’s determination that asbestos, including legacy uses and disposal, poses an unreasonable risk to human health. EPN emphasized that many workers remain dangerously unprotected due to outdated or unenforced OSHA standards, and highlighted the urgent need for strong federal action to prevent persistent, preventable exposures. The resulting 2024 rule, issued under the amended Toxic Substances Control Act, was the most robust federal measure in decades to phase out chrysotile asbestos in commercial and industrial applications. It affirmed what science has long made clear: there is no safe level of asbestos exposure. The now-withdrawn proposal would have undermined key provisions of that rule, particularly those restricting use in chlorine manufacturing and industrial gaskets, sectors where safer alternatives already exist.

The Environmental Protection Network reaffirms that any further attempt to weaken or delay this ban must be met with unified resistance and warns that this reversal does not mark the end of the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda. It is part of a disturbing pattern of catering to corporate polluters at the expense of human health, environmental safety, and scientific integrity.

“We’re not standing by; we’re standing up,” Roos added. “This administration has shown that it will try to dismantle as many protections as it can get away with. But, every time that they move to put polluters before people, we will push back — loudly, strategically, relentlessly — because it works, in the courts and in the streets. Public health is not up for negotiation.”

In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.
However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits.
The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits.
Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB), which significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Under the new law, tax credits for wind and solar projects phase out much sooner. To qualify, these projects must either be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction within the next 12 months. This compressed timeline will likely force developers to accelerate their project schedules or risk losing critical tax credits. In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, and limited to electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing tax credits, these “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules have now been expanded under the OBBB to cover virtually all tax credits. The expanded FEOC rules deny credits to projects that are owned or controlled by certain foreign entities — or that purchase components from or make payment to these foreign entities. Notably, the list of FEOCs includes all companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects face a shorter window to qualify for tax credits. Projects that were under construction by the end of 2024 are largely unaffected by the new law. Projects first starting construction in 2025 must generally comply with the FEOC ownership requirements, and projects beginning construction in 2026 or later must navigate a complex set of FEOC sourcing and payment rules, including proving that an increasing share of components are sourced outside of China.

Going forward, a key factor for most clean energy projects will be the date they begin construction, as this will determine both their eligibility for tax credits and the extent to which they must comply with the FEOC rules. Over the past 12 years, the IRS has issued a series of notices that define what it means for a project to be “under construction” along with related rules on transfers and completion deadlines. The OBBB clarifies that this existing guidance continues to apply for purposes of the effective date of the “material assistance” FEOC rules described below.

However, the Trump administration issued an executive order on July 7, 2026, directing the US Treasury department to revisit the begun construction rules with respect to solar and wind facilities within 45 days, including by “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” These guidelines (and the extent to which they are changed for solar and wind) are now likely to become central to how developers assess the value of their pipelines and plan future investments. Many in the industry will now rely on these IRS rules to guide investment decisions and accelerate project timelines, as construction start dates become a critical factor in securing favorable tax treatment under the new law.

This Client Alert provides a detailed description of the OBBB’s changes to the tax credits across different technologies and the FEOC rules.

Solar and Wind ITC and PTC

Projects that began construction before 2025 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. Projects that start construction in 2025 or later are eligible under existing law for tax credits that are similar to the investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC) and referred to as “technology neutral credits.” Most of the restrictions in the new law related to renewables are aimed at curtailing these technology neutral credits.

Despite the technology neutral focus of existing law, solar and wind are subject to different — and harsher — treatment under the OBBB than other technologies. Projects have to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. Under pre-OBBB law, projects beginning construction in 2025 or 2026 would have until the end of 2029 or the end of 2030, respectively, to be placed in service, or else their developers must demonstrate that work is continuous based on the facts.

Solar and wind projects, as well as other projects eligible for technology neutral tax credits, will also become subject to the FEOC requirements, which are described in further detail below.

Helpfully, the OBBB does not affect eligibility for tax credit adders (e.g., for projects located in an energy community or that meet domestic content requirements), eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the ability to transfer tax credits to third parties for cash, or place restrictions on residential solar leasing. Restrictions on the latter three had been proposed in prior iterations of the bill. The final bill focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

Although the domestic content tax credit bonus is retained, the OBBB fixes an apparent glitch from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have increased the qualification threshold to up to 55% over time for PTC projects but left the ITC threshold static at 40%. ITC projects that began construction before June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects seeking to claim a domestic content adder that began construction after that date must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%, with increasing annual thresholds that match the PTC version thereafter.

Storage and Other Technologies Eligible for the ITC and PTC

Non-solar and wind technologies (e.g., storage, hydropower, and geothermal) fare much better under the OBBB. Tax credits for these projects are subject to a phase-down schedule that begins for projects that commence construction after 2033. Projects beginning construction in 2034 and 2035 will still qualify for tax credits but with a 75% and 50% haircut, respectively. These projects must meet the traditional continuity test, which requires placement in service by the end of the fourth year after the end of the year in which construction starts, or else demonstrate that construction was continuous based on the facts.

Fuel cells (including linear generators) were added as a special category of ITC-eligible technology. Fuel cell projects generally involve some level of greenhouse gas emissions, which would make them ineligible for the technology neutral ITC pre-OBBB. They are newly eligible for a 30% ITC without regard to emissions and are also exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. They cannot qualify for tax credit adders. Eligibility begins for projects that start construction after 2025.

Clean Fuels

The OBBB significantly modifies the section 45Z PTC for clean transportation fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is extended by two years to cover fuel sold through December 31, 2029, but reduces the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon beginning for fuel produced after 2025. The OBBB also eliminates the excise tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel with respect to any sale or use after September 30, 2025, and prohibits double counting by barring 45Z credits on any fuel produced from fuel that would have qualified for 45Z credits on its own. Fuel feedstock will have to come from the United States, Mexico, or Canada to qualify for a credit.

The new law forecloses the possibility of claiming additional 45Z credits based on “negative emissions.” The credit amount is calculated according to the “emissions factor” of the fuel, with a floor of 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU to qualify. The greater the emissions rate, the smaller the emissions factor and the smaller the tax credit. Conversely, if the emissions rate is negative, prior law appears to allow taxpayers to claim a credit above $1.00 for clean fuel and above $1.75 for sustainable aviation fuel. The OBBB prevents this result.

The OBBB also restores the expired tax credit under section 40A for small agri-biodiesel producers through 2026 and increases the credit amount from 10 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. The tax credit will be newly eligible to be sold to third parties for cash.

As described in further detail below, projects intending to claim 45Z credits will become subject to FEOC ownership restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture receives relatively favorable treatment under the OBBB compared to other credits. The credit is available for carbon dioxide that is captured and then permanently sequestered, used in enhanced oil recovery, or put to another commercial use. The credit amount had been higher for a sequestration use case compared to the others on the theory that sequestration is uneconomic without the tax incentive. The OBBB puts all use cases on equal footing so that both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for a credit of up to $85 per metric ton (or more in the case of direct air capture).

Similar to the 45Z tax credit for clean fuels, projects will become subject to the ownership-related FEOC restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

The OBBB makes numerous changes to the section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which provides a tax credit for the production and sale of certain solar, wind, and battery components, as well as the production and purification of certain critical minerals. Among other changes, the OBBB:

terminates the tax credit for wind components sold after 2027;

creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal”;

begins phasing out tax credits for critical mineral production (other than metallurgical coal, which terminates after 2029) after 2030, with termination after 2033;

subjects manufacturers to similar FEOC rules as those that apply to the technology neutral ITC and PTC; and

requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” as a condition for tax credit eligibility.

Metallurgical coal is unique compared to the other critical minerals in that it is allowed to be produced outside of the United States. Federal tax credit eligibility in general, even outside of the critical minerals context, usually requires the activity being subsidized to occur in the United States. However, the credit is only worth 2.5% of the cost compared to 10% with respect to other critical minerals. The coal must be suitable for use in the production of steel.

Notably, the OBBB does not fully restrict the sale of integrated components, which had been proposed in the initial Senate bill. The initial Senate bill would have essentially prevented manufacturers of multiple components that are integrated into an end product from claiming credits on each individual component. Instead, the OBBB permits the stacking of credits provided that the components that are integrated together are produced in the same facility, the end product is sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65% of the direct material costs of the underlying components are attributable to US mining, production, or manufacturing.

Foreign Entities of Concern

The OBBB imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. These restrictions fall into two categories: (1) those relating to ownership or control, and (2) those relating to assistance during construction. To the extent an FEOC restriction contains a beginning of construction concept, the OBBB memorializes long-standing IRS guidance that allows a project owner to begin construction by either incurring 5% of project costs or else beginning physical work of a significant nature.

1. FEOC — Ownership Restrictions

The first FEOC restriction generally prohibits a project owner from claiming technology neutral tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, clean fuel production tax credits, and tax credits for carbon sequestration for any tax year in which the person otherwise generating the tax credit is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.” These restrictions generally apply to tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, though the restrictions relating to foreign-influenced entities do not restrict clean fuel production tax credits until tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Specified foreign entities should be relatively easy to identify. These include entities owned by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; entities owned by citizens of those countries or otherwise organized or having a principal place of business in one of those countries; certain battery manufacturers; and certain other similar entities.

An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if: a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint board members or officers; a single specified entity owns more than 25% of the entity; one or more specified foreign entities owns an aggregate of 40% of the entity; or at least 15% of the entity’s debt is held by specified foreign entities (in the aggregate).

An entity is also a foreign-influenced entity if during the prior taxable year the entity made payments to a specified foreign entity pursuant to an arrangement that allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a project (in the case of technology neutral tax credits) or production of any components (in the case of advanced manufacturing tax credits). The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits. Because effective control requires examination of payments made in the prior taxable year, project owners should closely scrutinize any contract that requires a payment, or any payments recently made, which could provide a contractual counterparty with any specific authority over production of components, energy generation, or energy storage.

Contractual rights that allow a counterparty to determine the amount or timing of production, restrict access to data relating to production, determine the purchase of power output, or maintain or otherwise operate a project on an exclusive basis can create effective control. Effective control can also be granted by licensing arrangements that specify or direct material or other components in a project, allow the licensor to direct the operation of the project, limit the taxpayer’s use of the licensed property, provide a right to royalties for more than 10 years, or otherwise require the project owner to hire a project operator for more than two years at the licensor’s direction.

Finally, for projects claiming the technology neutral ITC, the OBBB imposes a recapture of 100% of the tax credit value if payments conveying effective control are made within 10 years of the project being placed in service.

2. FEOC — Material Assistance Rules

The second set of FEOC restrictions prohibits project owners from claiming technology neutral tax credits if construction on the project started after December 31, 2025, and the project receives material assistance from a specified foreign entity. A similar prohibition limits project owners from claiming advanced manufacturing tax credits for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2025, if the owner received material assistance from a specified foreign entity.

An entity receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity if the material assistance cost ratio applicable either to the power generation project or the manufacturing project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The applicable threshold percentages are shown in Exhibit A (below), which can be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury in the case of the applicable threshold relating to critical minerals.

The material assistance cost ratio for a power plant or battery is generally the difference between the total direct costs for manufactured products less the direct costs attributable to a specified foreign entity, divided by the total direct costs. This effectively examines the “good” costs over the total costs. The material assistance cost ratio for a manufactured component is the “good” material costs over the total material costs.

The OBBB directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue safe harbor tables applying a methodology similar to that adopted with respect to the calculation of domestic content under Notice 2025-08 for material assistance. Before these tables are issued, taxpayers can rely on Notice 2025-08 along with a supplier certification, though this has an obvious shortcoming in that Notice 2025-08 has tables for a limited subset of power production technologies. Developers of other technologies will have to rely on actual labor and materials costs to run the calculations.

Other Changes

The clean hydrogen PTC terminates for projects that begin construction after 2027. Prior iterations of the bill in both the House and Senate would have terminated the credit if construction did not begin by the end of 2025.

Bonus depreciation — the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain business property, including renewables projects, as a depreciation deduction — is made permanent for property acquired after January 19, 2025. Bonus depreciation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was set to phase out after 2026 for most property. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation entirely or alternatively elect into a 40% bonus (or 60% bonus for property with a longer production period).

The PTC for nuclear facilities under 45U will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions.

Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026. The exact dates and mechanics vary by credit. Affected credits include the 30D clean vehicle credit, the 45W qualified commercial vehicles credit, the 30C credit for charging stations, and the residential clean energy credit under 25D.

Martin wanted to go further and link the homes with a small power grid that would let homeowners share surplus power with each other.","Hawaiian Electric Co.’s century-long hold on Hawaiʻi’s electricity market soon will change in a major way, creating a potential path to lower rates for businesses and residents.

Starting in 2027, HECO will be required to let independent electricity producers use its grid to deliver electricity directly to customers for a fee, potentially ending the utility’s standing as the sole choice for most electric consumers in the state. Under the current system, producers must sell electricity at a wholesale price to HECO, which pools it to sell to customers at a higher rate.

Gov. Josh Green signed the groundbreaking bill on Thursday, despite having previously signaled his intent to veto the measure.

It remains to be seen to what extent the new system will lead to significant savings for residential customers. A previously passed law allowing renters to buy power from community solar farms, for instance , has gone nowhere, hampered by what critics say are untenable rules. But even critics of the new law have said it could generate savings for some customers.

State Sen. Glenn Wakai, who chairs the Energy and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee and sponsored the bill, said the measure was meant to introduce competition in Hawaiʻi’s electricity market and reduce costs in a state where Hawaii%20has%20the%20highest%20average,highest%20share%20for%20any%20state."">customers pay the nation’s highest costs for electricity — more than three times the national average.

“We have for more than 100 years been at the mercy of HECO for our electricity needs, and we’ve seen in recent times that the delivery of that electricity has been very unreliable and very, very expensive,” Wakai said. “In the next two years, come 2027, all HECO’s customers will have an option of buying from someone other than HECO.”

“I think this is a game changer to benefit the consumers,” Wakai said.

Green’s office also expressed optimism.

“We believe that the provisions contained within the bill will allow for greater energy choice and hopefully a reduction in costs for Hawai‘i’s consumers,” Green’s spokeswoman, Makana McClellan, said in a written statement.

HECO spokesman Jim Kelly declined an interview request.

Law Could ‘Really Open Up Our Grid’

The law includes several provisions to break HECO’s hold on Hawaiʻi’s electricity market, but the most important involves what energy experts call wheeling.

Under the current system, developers build big wind and solar farms and sell the power to HECO under long-term contracts. HECO pays as little as 8 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity from these independent power producers, said Jeff Mikulina, a renewable energy consultant who was an architect of the law requiring Hawaiʻi to produce all of the electricity sold in the state from renewable resources by 2045.

Meanwhile, HECO charges residential customers on Oʻahu almost 43 cents per kilowatt hour. Big Island residents pay 48 cents.

Wakai said a goal of the law is to enable customers to pay closer to what the renewable electricity costs HECO to buy and to encourage smaller players to get in the game.

The wheeling provision does this by letting independent electricity producers pay a set fee to use HECO’s grid to deliver power to customers. Although wheeling has long been allowed on the mainland, it’s been prohibited by law in Hawaiʻi.

The PUC had been investigating a proposal to allow wheeling between government entities only, and Green’s intent-to-veto statement pointed to that as a reason to veto the broader bill. Green decided to sign the broad bill after the PUC said it would cancel the intra-governmental wheeling inquiry, McClellan said.

Hawaiʻi’s previous prohibition against wheeling has played out on the ground at places like Green Homes Hanalei, a cluster of seven homes in west Oʻahu built in 2017 around the idea of using solar and storage to make the subdivision as energy self-sufficient as possible.

Developer R.J. Martin powered each home with photovoltaic solar cells combined with two Tesla Powerwall batteries. Each home had garages with chargers for electric vehicles.

Martin wanted to go further and link the homes with a small power grid that would let homeowners share surplus power with each other. But he quickly learned that would be illegal. Homeowners would have to become regulated utilities to share surplus electricity with their neighbors.

“No one in their right mind is going to go through that exercise,” Wakai said. “So now, it just simplifies what has been all these walls and impediments put up by the government as well as by HECO.”

Martin hopes the new law will enable him to do something more innovative in the near future: use renewables and perhaps a microgrid to power a larger, workforce housing subdivision he’s planning for West Oʻahu.

But much will depend on how the Hawaiʻi Public Utilities Commission implements the law, Mikulina said.

“If the PUC does it right, it can really open up our grid to some innovative renewable solutions,” Mikulina said. “This could catalyze renewable growth and really help folks who need access to this.”

Critics Say Some Could Be Left Out

Critics point to potential unintended consequences.

A major issue involves equity. The concern is that HECO customers with the money and wherewithal to partner with an independent power producer will defect from HECO, leaving those less well-off to still deal with higher rates.

Testifying against the bill, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260, which works on utility infrastructure, argued the long-term technical effects of wheeling on HECO’s grid are unknown.

“Further,” the union wrote, “the fixed-cost of operating and maintaining the system will remain unchanged and passed on to those left in the system, essentially increasing the cost of electricity to those who can least afford it.”

Given this risk, it will be key to make sure lower-income residential customers can benefit as the commission creates rules governing the program, said Michael Colón, director of energy for the Ulupono Initiative, which supports the use of renewable energy.

To address such concerns, Wakai said, the law limits the size of a wind or solar farm allowed to use the wheeling provision to two megawatts, the size needed to power about 3,000 homes.

“We’re not talking about, you know, large 50- to 60-megawatt plants going and selling to all the Waikīkī hotels,” Wakai said. “That’s not going to be possible under this scenario.”

“What is possible under this scenario,” he said, “is, if you have let’s say 10 acres of land that can create two megawatts of power, you are free to go and sell to the nearby residents or wheel it across the island to someone who’s willing to take it.”

That’s promising news to people like Steve Mazur, director of commercial business development for RevoluSun, one of Hawaiʻi’s largest solar companies.

Mazur said he’s encountered business owners with energy hogging cold storage systems but small rooftops located near businesses with huge rooftops but little electricity needs. If implemented well by the PUC, Mazur said, the new law could make way for solar panels on the large roof to power the neighboring business.

,EPA,2025-07-08 20:37:29+00:00,Colorado Public Radio,Colorado has a new rule to limit gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric,"Sam Brasch, Tom Hesse, Tony Gorman, Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun, Olivia Bagan",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/08/gas-powered-lawn-tools-colorado-law-enforcement/,"A new state air quality rule went into effect on June 1, banning government entities from using small gas-powered lawn equipment during the summer ozone season.
Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment plays an outsized role in the perennial air quality problem.
Those entities are now restricted from using smaller gas-powered equipment such as leaf blowers, tillers and edgers from June 1 to August 31.
The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission could also reconsider whether to phase out the sale of handheld gas-powered lawn tools at Front Range retailers.
Air quality advocates want to better understand compliance with current lawn equipment rules before pushing for further restrictions.","At the start of the summer, Johnny Jimenez gathered the crews he manages at Designscapes Colorado, a commercial landscaping company headquartered in Centennial, a suburb south of Denver.

A new state air quality rule went into effect on June 1, banning government entities from using small gas-powered lawn equipment during the summer ozone season. Since the company holds contracts to maintain public parks, Jimenez told his workers all gas-powered, hand-held lawn equipment had to come off their trailers in favor of newly purchased electric leaf blowers and string trimmers.

“To put a battery-operated machine in their hand, it was kind of like a learning curve, and it still is a learning curve,” Jimenez recalled. “It's just trial and error. We have no choice.”

The switch comes as Colorado struggles to cut ground-level ozone pollution along the Front Range. The dangerous lung irritant — better known as smog — routinely climbs above federal health standards on summer afternoons. After decades of failing to fix the problem, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reclassified a nine-county region around metro Denver as a “severe” ozone violator in 2022.

Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment plays an outsized role in the perennial air quality problem. The lawn equipment rule — approved in 2023 — marks Colorado's most aggressive effort to address the pollution source so far, but the state is taking a “flexible” enforcement approach, prioritizing education and outreach over fines and other penalties.

The strategy has put Designscapes at the forefront of the transition to electric lawn care. Despite the lax enforcement approach, the company embraced the shift to win government contracts and satisfy residential customers bothered by the guttural roar of gas-powered equipment. It’s now figuring out whether battery-powered lawn care can work at a commercial scale.

New rules to mow down pollution

Gas-powered lawn equipment might be small, but the tools are a major pollution source because their engines effectively work as smog machines.

Many weed wackers and leaf blowers rely on two-stroke motors burning a combination of oil and gasoline. The resulting exhaust contains large amounts of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, the two key ingredients necessary to form ground-level ozone. Most mowers rely on cleaner four-stroke motors but lack emissions control systems like catalytic converters found in most cars.

One byproduct is some shocking air quality statistics. The California Air Resources Board estimates running a commercial leaf blower for a single hour emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a new car 1,100 miles from Los Angeles to Denver. Around metro Denver, the lawn tools emit more volatile organic compounds than all vehicles on the road, according to the Regional Air Quality Council, the leading air quality planning agency for the Front Range.

Air quality regulators adopted the new lawn care rules — known as Regulation 29 — in 2023. The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, a nine-member panel appointed by the governor, opted against more aggressive proposals supported by environmental advocates and local governments to ban the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment or directly regulate commercial companies.

It instead signed off on a plan to focus on public entities like school districts and city park departments. Those entities are now restricted from using smaller gas-powered equipment such as leaf blowers, tillers and edgers from June 1 to August 31.

But Michael Ogletree, Colorado’s senior director of air quality programs, said the state isn’t rushing to fine or punish anyone for failing to follow the rules.

“This is a new space we haven’t regulated in the past,” Ogletree said. “Right now, the way we’re working towards compliance is through education and outreach, and providing some flexibility if there are reasons why any particular entity can’t comply.”

Denver is one city taking advantage of extra breathing room. In a written statement, Stephanie Figueroa, a spokesperson for Denver Parks and Recreation, said her team “hasn’t purchased much equipment” because the city paused spending amid an ongoing major budget crunch.

Until those restrictions are lifted, Figueroa said her department will report usage of gas-powered tools to state authorities while it outlines a plan to transition to electric equipment.

A shift from gas cans to battery packs

Designscapes offers a preview of how governments across Colorado might adjust their operations to comply with the rules.

On a recent morning, a crew employed spanned out across Westlands Park in Greenwood Village, a 28-acre area packed with playgrounds and pavilions. The company still uses a gas-powered riding mower to cut large spaces, but switches to all-electric trimmers for smaller sections of weeds and grasses. Any debris on the sidewalks is then cleared with leaf blowers powered by a backpack stocked with batteries.

Brian Levins, the manager of the company’s landscaping operations, said Designscapes bought around $50,000 in electric equipment in anticipation of the new air quality rules. A $12,000 matching grant from the Regional Air Quality Council helped subsidize the purchase, and the equipment was further discounted by a 30 percent tax credit Colorado offers to offset the cost of electric lawn equipment.

“Reducing the noise, reducing the stress through all the vibration, reducing being exposed to those fumes all day — I thought that was a really positive thing to give to our team members,” Levins said.

The quieter equipment is appreciated by Jose Lara, the worker leading the crew maintaining the park. At the same time, he said he hopes battery technology continues to improve so he can work for longer stretches without trekking back to a trailer for a fully-charged pack.

More regulations could be on their way

After approving the new rules in 2023, Colorado air quality regulators plan to consider further regulations in November.

Those restrictions could include restricting commercial landscapers from using gas-powered equipment, not just public entities and their contractors. The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission could also reconsider whether to phase out the sale of handheld gas-powered lawn tools at Front Range retailers.

It’s unclear if the Gov. Jared Polis’ administration would support those policies. Ogletree, Colorado’s top air quality official, said his staff is in the early stages of researching the feasibility of different regulations given current market conditions and recent improvements in electric lawn care technology. The state hasn’t developed any formal proposal to offer commissioners later this year.

The landscaping industry is already gearing up to push back on anything it sees as too restrictive. Levins said Designscapes is glad it’s shifting to all-electric equipment, but he hopes regulators recognize other operators might lack the facilities and capital to manage a rapid transition.

“ There's just a lot of other costs that you don't necessarily think through when you first hear about these things. So for a smaller operator, I think it can be very, very burdensome,” Levins said.

Air quality advocates want to better understand compliance with current lawn equipment rules before pushing for further restrictions. Danny Katz, the executive director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, said it appears usage of gas-powered lawn tools remains common in parks and other public spaces. “Let’s get that right and then see what the next step is,” Katz said.

Other advocates want to see the state take decisive action. Elise Jones, the executive director of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, an environmental advocacy group, recently left her appointment on the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, where she pushed for more aggressive regulations to limit pollution from lawn equipment.

Jones said the state can’t hesitate to act if it wants to meet a mid-2027 deadline to comply with federal ozone standards, and should adopt plans to phase out gas-powered equipment from commercial lawncare companies and Front Range retailers.

“We'd all breathe easier if Colorado would step up and be a leader in transitioning away from noisy, polluting gasoline-powered lawn mowers, weed whackers and leaf blowers to clean, quiet electric-powered alternatives,” Jones said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250623_163630678-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:14:33.776990

The EV Tax Credit Panic: Dealers Scramble as Policy Shifts

When auto dealers start writing impassioned letters to Congress demanding to keep electric vehicle (EV) tax credits alive, it’s a clear sign the honeymoon phase of EV policy is over. Behind the public messaging of “going green” and “building the future,” a growing number of dealers and manufacturers are panicking — not because consumer demand is soaring, but because it’s not. The incentives have gone beyond promoting environmental goals; they’re propping up an industry shift that never had strong grassroots support in the first place.

Now, with the federal government poised to scale back or eliminate EV tax credits, parts of the automotive industry are scrambling. CarMax, Carvana, and several dealer groups are urging Congress to preserve the subsidies that have underwritten their investments in EV sales and service. Their plea is simple: without the $7,500 incentive on new EVs and $4,000 on used models, sales will slump. One Seattle-area dealer even warned of a 25–30% drop in EV sales.

Let’s be honest — this isn’t about saving the environment anymore. It’s about protecting profit margins and preserving political capital after years of lobbying silence. These same companies and their trade groups didn’t push back when mandates were being written into law. Now that the tide is turning, they want taxpayers to continue footing the bill for what is, at its core, a luxury purchase — typically made by high-income households with easy access to charging infrastructure. For most Americans, EVs remain unaffordable, and charging options are limited.

What’s Changing in Washington?

Congressional Republicans, backed by growing public skepticism of EV mandates, are working to remove the taxpayer-funded cushion that has made EVs appear more affordable than they actually are. The Senate version of the “Big Beautiful Bill” proposes ending EV tax credits by September 30, 2025 — three months earlier than the House version. The credits were originally set to expire in 2032.

Here’s what’s at stake:

New EVs (under $80,000): Up to $7,500 in tax credits

Used EVs (under $25,000): Up to $4,000 in tax credits

Automakers under the 200,000-EV threshold: Still qualify until 2026

But under Section 112002 of the Senate bill, these credits are set to be eliminated. Additionally, the bill includes a $250 annual registration fee for EVs and a $100 fee for hybrids and plug-in hybrids — meant to compensate for lost gas tax revenue used to maintain highways. It’s also a tacit acknowledgment that EV drivers aren’t currently paying their share for public roads, which are deteriorating across the country.

Too Little, Too Late?

Dealers and manufacturers had years to challenge the growing wave of federal mandates that funneled billions into EV production and infrastructure. They didn’t — because the gravy train was running. Generous government contracts, purchase incentives, and regulatory advantages made it too lucrative to raise objections.

Now, with the Trump administration signaling a sharp policy reversal, the industry wants the benefits to stay — even though the rules are changing.

But this is the cost of doing business. You don’t get to opt out of consequences now that the political winds have shifted. If customers want EVs, they’ll buy them.

That’s how the free market works. What we’re seeing is an attempt to artificially prop up demand with taxpayer dollars, even as surveys show most Americans still prefer internal combustion or hybrid vehicles. Cost, range anxiety, and lack of charging infrastructure remain major concerns.

A Judicial Speed Bump in the EV Rollback

In a twist that highlights the tangled relationship between politics and policy, a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from halting EV infrastructure funds for 14 states. These funds — part of President Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act — were designed to eliminate “range anxiety” by building a nationwide EV charging network.

The result? $5 billion spent, and only 7 EV chargers are live today — a staggering waste of taxpayer dollars.

U.S. District Judge Tana Lin ruled that withholding these funds exceeded federal authority. As a result, states like California, New York, and Colorado will see their EV infrastructure plans reinstated — for now. An appeal is underway, and many expect these funds to eventually be clawed back.

Still, the ruling doesn’t shift the larger momentum. Trump’s Department of Transportation has made its stance clear: the Biden-Buttigieg New Electric Vehicle Initiative was a failure — and it’s being dismantled.

Investor and Investment Media inquiries: 949-273-4990 ir@cetyinc.com Source: Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.","IRVINE, CA., July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company offering power generation, waste to energy, battery storage, and heat to power solutions to deliver affordable, scalable, and eco-friendly energy, clean fuels, and alternative electricity for a sustainable future, is pleased to announce that its technologies should remain fully eligible for federal clean energy tax incentives following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025.

Under the new legislation, projects utilizing CETY’s waste heat-to-power, biomass combined heat and power (CHP), and battery storage technologies should continue to qualify for the most Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and Production Tax Credits (PTC) established by the Inflation Reduction Act—up to 30% ITC or 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour PTC—provided they meet updated requirements for zero greenhouse gas emissions, prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards.

“This legislation reinforces our competitive edge, said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Unlike solar, wind, EV, or hydrogen projects, many of which face new limitations, our technologies remain fully supported. This positions CETY as a premier opportunity for shareholders seeking exposure to resilient, profitable clean energy solutions.”

The OBBBA retains incentives for technologies like CETY’s when:

Projects began construction by December 31, 2024, qualifying them under existing IRA-era credits.

New projects meet stricter requirements under Section 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Credit) and Section 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Credit), including:

Demonstrated zero or net-negative lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions

Compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship guidelines

Use of U.S.-sourced components to satisfy domestic content rules

No participation by prohibited foreign entities of concern

The updated tax credits will gradually phase down starting in 2033 and sunset by the end of 2035, creating a limited window for investors and developers to capitalize on these incentives.

“As the energy landscape shifts, our waste heat recovery, biomass CHP, power generation, and battery storage solutions are essential for industrial and commercial facilities aiming to cut emissions and operating costs,” Kam Mahdi added. “Whether it’s converting agricultural or forestry waste into clean energy through biomass systems, capturing waste heat from industrial processes to generate power, tapping geothermal resources for sustainable electricity, or providing reliable power and storage for high-demand applications like data centers and crypto mining operations, CETY stands ready to deliver cutting-edge technologies that meet—and exceed—the federal government’s latest standards. CETY also anticipates curing Nasadq price deficiency by Novenmber 3rd , 2025.”

To clean energy advocates in California and around the country, that means consumers will pay more and the environment will suffer.

The credit for used EVs in particular is a “lost opportunity to reduce transportation energy burden and help California families save thousands of dollars in fuel costs,” said Ingrid Malmgren, senior policy director at Plug In America, an education and advocacy nonprofit.

Conservatives have been eager to do away with the credit, saying it was little more than a subsidy for consumers who had no need for it.

“The hard-earned money of taxpaying Americans should not cover the cost for the luxuries of the nation’s elite,” said Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyoming.

The credits were enacted in 2022 as part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

The credits can help qualified buyers or lessees of electric vehicles, hybrid plug-in or fuel-cell-powered cars with a manufacturer’s suggested retail prices of $55,000 or less or vans, SUVs or trucks with an MSRP of $80,000 or less. The vehicle’s final assembly must be in North America.

Income limits on current tax breaks

The breaks are available on new vehicles to joint income tax filers with modified adjusted gross income under $300,000 and individuals with modified AGI under $150,000. The income limits to qualify for breaks on used vehicles are lower.

The bill had no Republican support, and many GOP lawmakers vowed to repeal it as soon as they could. They did just that in the Big Beautiful Bill, a sweeping tax and spending measure President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.

The repeal had strong backing from influential conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity.

“The Biden-era EV credits were a top-down policy that picked winners and losers, distorted markets and put upward pressure on consumer prices,” Faith Burns, the group’s energy policy fellow, told The Bee.

The Big Beautiful Bill, she said, “prioritizes unleashing American energy independence by reducing government overreach like these Biden-era credits for the wealthy.”

But Malmgren saw the repeal as putting pressure on California and other local governments.

“The repeal of the federal Clean Vehicle Tax Credits will increase the reliance on state and utility incentives to help consumers buy cleaner vehicles. This will particularly burden lower-income drivers and families since the federal incentives have been so successful at making electric vehicle purchase prices more affordable,” she said.

Would California backfill EV credits?

Weeks after Trump was elected, Gov. Gavin Newsom pledged to restart a statewide clean car rebate program if the new president yanked federal subsidies. Until 2023, the state offered up to $7,500 to purchase or lease electric, fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles.

But the governor has not laid out any specific plans and just signed a budget that closed a $12 billion deficit with no new money for EV incentives.

When asked for comment, Newsom’s office signaled that any new rebates would be tied to the governor’s push to reauthorize cap-and-trade, the program that sells emissions credits and reinvests the funds in climate projects.

“Pending these discussions, this could include new zero-emission vehicle incentives,” said Daniel Villaseñor, Newsom’s deputy communications director.

Sen. Ben Allen, D-Santa Monica, is skeptical.

“The challenge is that the cap-and-trade fund has been massively raided already,” said Allen, who chairs the Senate’s budget subcommittee on environmental spending. He pointed out Newsom shifted about $1 billion for Cal Fire funding from the General Fund to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund this year and wants to commit another $1 billion annually for high-speed rail.

“I’m very disappointed by the president’s decision” to end EV credits, Allen said. “I appreciated the governor’s initial reaction. At the same time, I’m also very cognizant of how limited resources are.”

During its 13-year lifespan, California’s clean car rebate program doled out nearly $1.5 billion in incentives, which helped residents buy more than 594,000 vehicles, according to state figures.

The rebate shut down two years ago as the state began prioritizing assistance for low-income households to purchase EVs.

The end of EV credits will “impact the market some,” said energy lobbyist Frank Maisano, but maybe less so in California where EVs have had a higher uptake than in other states.

“We are almost beyond the early adopters, especially in California, so incentives can be helpful to get new first-time EV owners, but it is still a struggle to get them in EVs because some people just don’t like the inconveniences that come with EVs,” he said.

The cost of a car

AAA has found that a new, compact EV costs about $600 more overall than a similar gasoline-powered car. It said the electricity needed to drive 15,000 miles annually in a compact EV costs an average of $546. A gasoline-powered car driven a similar distance would cost $1,255.

First looking at cost by using the same methodology as its annual Your Driving Costs study, AAA found that owning a new, compact electric vehicle was only slightly more expensive – about $600 annually - than its gas-powered counterpart. Although the overall costs are more, electric vehicles are lower in individual categories such as fuel and maintenance.

AAA found that because EVs don’t need as much maintenance – they don’t need oil changes, for instance – the cost for upkeep would be $330 less than the $949 annually a gasoline-powered car costs.

Their actions respond to numerous recent developments regarding NEPA, including President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” and the Council for Environmental Quality’s (CEQ) Interim Final Rule rescinding regulations purporting to implement NEPA. Their actions came days before the U.S. Congress revised NEPA as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which was signed into law on July 4, 2025.

Specifically, FERC issued Order No. 908, a Final Rule to remove references to now-rescinded CEQ NEPA regulations. It also released a Staff Guidance Manual on Implementation of NEPA (Manual) that outlines the updated procedures. The FERC Manual instructs the agency’s Staff and project applicants on:

Authorizations to adopt categorical exclusions (CatExs) approved by other agencies.

Submissions by natural gas and hydropower applicants on self-prepared Environmental Assessments (EAs).

Reliance by FERC on EAs and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) approved by other agencies.

Maintaining NEPA’s two-year EIS deadline.

Removing requirements to consider climate change and environmental justice in EAs and EISs.

While FERC’s rule changes in Order No. 908 are mostly ministerial, DOE published a more fulsome update to its NEPA implementing regulations in an Interim Final Rule, and requests comments by August 4, 2025.

FERC June 2025 NEPA Overhaul: Key Provisions

Order No. 908 follows the Interim Final Rule published by CEQ on February 25, 2025, to rescind its NEPA regulations,1 which fulfilled one directive in EO 14154, which also had directed federal agencies to streamline their permitting processes.2 Order No. 908 removes references in FERC’s regulations implementing NEPA to the rescinded CEQ regulations and adopts the Manual as the primary framework for NEPA compliance. Even though historically FERC treated executive orders and CEQ guidance as non-binding on it as an independent agency, it had treated CEQ’s published regulations as binding. FERC adopted Order No. 908 unanimously. The Manual introduces several procedural changes aimed at expediting environmental reviews, discussed below.

Deadlines

The Manual retains NEPA’s two-year statutory deadline for completing EISs. However, within a week of its publication, the U.S. Congress amended NEPA in the OBBBA to create an accelerated review process through payment of Project-Sponsor Opt-In Fees. Under Section 60062 of the OBBBA, project sponsors may fast-track NEPA review by paying CEQ a fee equal to 125% of the anticipated cost to prepare the EA or EIS. In return, EAs must be completed within 180 days of payment, and EISs within one year after the sponsor notifies CEQ of its intent to prepare an EIS. An expedited timeline potentially could limit opportunities for public comment and stakeholder engagement. Applicants should consider the possibility of expedited environmental reviews in financing, construction and parallel permitting plans.

Categorical Exclusions

The FERC Rule allows the agency to adopt other agencies’ CatExs, which exempt a class of actions from EA or EIS requirements based on a determination that the actions do not have a significant effect on the environment. To adopt other agencies’ CatExs, FERC must consult with the approving agency and provide public notice in the Federal Register. Current FERC CatExs provide streamlined permitting for projects such as water power projects, small conduit hydroelectric facility exemptions, and offshore platform abandonment, among others.3 Under the new guidance, we expect to see this list grow, particularly for routine or lower-impact infrastructure projects.

Applicant-Prepared Documents

Pursuant to the new rules, natural gas and hydropower applicants may prepare their own EAs or engage third-party contractors to prepare EAs or EISs to submit to FERC. This approach may lessen FERC’s internal workload, reduce backlogs and accelerate review times. It potentially allows applicants to have greater influence over the environmental reports.

Interagency Coordination

The Manual emphasizes early coordination with lead and cooperating agencies. It also allows FERC to rely on prior EAs or EISs prepared by other agencies or FERC staff when the proposed action is substantially similar, possibly accelerating review timelines. This approach may benefit projects that require multiple federal approvals by reducing duplicative reviews and fostering more consistency across agencies.

Climate Change and Environmental Justice

FERC no longer will consider climate change or environmental justice impacts in EAs or EISs, consistent with broader Trump administration policy.4 Several recent decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had scrutinized FERC’s review of environmental justice community impacts and this issue, along with greenhouse gas emissions upstream or downstream of the project footprint, had become a regular platform for challenging the agency review process, which Akin previously noted. For applicants, this change may ease permitting obstacles and expand the range of viable project locations.

DOE June 2025 NEPA Overhaul

The DOE Interim Final Rule rescinds many of the agency’s NEPA regulations and replaces them with NEPA Implementing Procedures. However, DOE retained regulations on CatExs, emergency circumstances and administrative exemptions from NEPA review. The Interim Final Rule also exempts Presidential permits from NEPA review, as such permits are “delegated Presidential action” and “Presidential actions are not subject to NEPA.” The Implementing Procedures aim to streamline environmental reviews by reducing EIS timelines from three to two years, limiting analysis to “reasonably foreseeable environmental effects,” adopting EAs, EISs and CatExs approved by other federal agencies and seeking to bypass the 30-day CEQ consultation for new CatExs when possible. The Interim Final Rule leans heavily into the May 2025 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, Colorado. As explained in a prior Akin client alert, the Court’s decision granted significant NEPA deference to agencies.

Next Steps

FERC’s revised NEPA framework complements FERC’s other recent efforts to expedite project approvals. These include actions taken by FERC in June to grant a one-year waiver of Order No. 871, which had implemented rules that delayed construction of natural gas facilities, and a two-year waiver raising the cost threshold for natural gas facility improvements requiring FERC approval.

Looking ahead, FERC’s revised NEPA procedures, along with changes made and proposed by DOE and other federal permitting agencies, are expected to accelerate project approvals, reduce administrative burdens and lower costs for both FERC and developers. While these changes signal a clear policy shift toward streamlining energy infrastructure development, project developers should still take steps to ensure that their permits are sufficient to withstand judicial scrutiny.

EU member states ask for cuts to deforestation rules

What’s the story?

Eighteen of the European Union’s 27 member states sent a letter July 7 asking the EU to scale back its upcoming deforestation rules, set to take effect in December. The countries argued the rules risked putting EU businesses at a competitive disadvantage.

Why does it matter?

The letter shows EU member states are divided over ESG rules and concerned that some policies may burden their economies.

According to Reuters:

Most European Union countries have demanded further changes to the bloc’s anti-deforestation law, saying some of its producers cannot be expected to meet its terms and face a competitive disadvantage, a letter seen by Reuters showed. …

Brussels has already delayed its launch by a year and cut back reporting rules following criticism from trading partners, including the United States, as well as from EU countries.

Of the EU’s 27 member countries, agriculture ministers from 18 wrote to the Commission on Monday, demanding the EU rules are not applied to countries deemed to have a low risk of deforestation. They should stick to national measures instead, they said.

European ESG investors seek alternatives to regulation

What’s the story?

Some European institutional investors—including Norwegian pension fund KLP—are promoting ESG through their asset allocations and potential legal action as the EU reduces regulations.

Why does it matter?

Investors are taking a larger role in promoting ESG standards, shifting influence from government oversight to the private sector.

According to Bloomberg:

Asset managers and asset owners based in northern Europe say they’re ready to cut allocations to companies they think are using a lack of regulations as an excuse to be less transparent about their ESG risks. In interviews with Bloomberg, they also say they’re ready to consider legal steps to protect their portfolios from climate change and human rights risks.

The development follows a major about-face in Europe, which has long been the biggest market for ESG, with more than 80% of the world’s sustainable fund assets. After taking an early lead on ESG, policymakers in the European Union are now significantly winding back earlier ambitions so that only a fraction of the companies once in scope still face sustainable reporting and due diligence requirements. …

Against that backdrop, European investors are now taking matters into their own hands. “We have engaged with several law firms to better understand how the changing political situation in the US will impact our rights as a minority shareholder and what potential risks we may face in exercising our active ownership efforts,” said Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at Norwegian pension fund KLP, which oversees about $114 billion.

Arkansas leads in anti-ESG laws

What’s the story?

Pleiades Strategy, a pro-ESG consultancy, published an annual report showing Arkansas led the nation in the number of anti-ESG bills passed since 2021.

Ballotpedia identified 12 anti-ESG bills enacted in Arkansas since 2021. Idaho, Louisiana, and Utah were tied for second with eight anti-ESG bills each.

On the other side, California had the most pro-ESG bills with nine, followed by Illinois with eight.

Why does it matter?

The 12 passed bills put Arkansas’ anti-ESG passage rate at about 71% (five bills have failed). Other states, including Missouri with 55 introduced bills and one enacted, have much lower passage rates.

The success rates indicate different levels of support for and different approaches to anti-ESG policies between states with Republican trifectas.

According to Arkansas Advocate:

The state has enacted seven anti-ESG measures, not including resolutions, since 2021. Connor Gibson, one of the report’s authors, said the ESG label is nebulous, but often takes aim at climate goals, social justice initiatives and culture war targets.

Much of the legislation that has moved through statehouses in the U.S. is based on model bills propagated by right-leaning think tanks like the Heritage Foundation, he said. The bills often prohibit state entities from giving contracts to or investing in businesses proponents believe discriminate against firearm manufacturers or fossil fuel companies, for example. …

The climate advisory group’s 2025 Statehouse Report highlighted the anti-ESG trends in legislatures across the country. Arkansas was one of the most effective states in passing such laws, said Gibson. While some states, like Missouri and Arizona, have proposed dozens of anti-ESG bills only to pass one or none, most of the legislation that’s gone before Arkansas lawmakers ended up becoming law.

Ohio legislature passes, North Carolina governor vetoes ESG-related bills

Two states took action on two ESG-related bills last week (since July 1).

An Ohio bill proposing to block the state board of deposit from directing the state treasurer to sell investments for the primary purpose of advancing ESG policy passed both chambers.

A North Carolina bill proposing to bar state and local governments from entering into contracts with private businesses that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives was vetoed.

According to Bloomberg:

At recent climate summits in London, representatives from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. were mingling with their European counterparts to discuss investment themes that have been vilified by the Trump administration. …

“We are an American bank, but especially being a highly regulated industry, we have to assess and evaluate what’s coming at us from all parts of the world,” Taylor Wright, head of operational sustainability at JPMorgan, said in an interview. “We see pressures on both sides.” …

Speaking at the City Week Net Zero Finance Innovation Summit, Cathy Shepherd, Citigroup’s global head of clean energy transition and the UK head of natural resources, said the current atmosphere in the US means clients concerned with transition finance are “really taking a pause on those investments.” That means that “money that’s sitting on the sidelines is starting to look elsewhere,” with Europe a “natural home” for those flows, she said.

AI energy needs complicate climate goals

What’s the story?

Google’s latest annual environmental report showed its overall emissions were up 51% since 2019 with rising AI and data center energy demands.

Why does it matter?

Google joins other big tech companies struggling to reach 2030 net zero emissions goals. Microsoft recently announced carbon capture investments as part of their effort to reach their end-of-decade environmental targets. The reports both highlight how AI energy demands are complicating corporate sustainability goals.

According to ESG Dive:

Google’s overall emissions are up 51% compared to a 2019 baseline, according to its latest annual environmental report. This jump in its overall carbon footprint comes despite the company’s progress in reducing its data center emissions and working towards its goal of powering operations on 24/7 clean energy last year.

The global tech and search engine conglomerate reduced its data center emissions 12% in 2024, despite rising energy demands due to artificial intelligence. Additionally, the company said it signed power agreements for 8 gigawatts of new clean energy generation and brought 2.5 GW of new clean energy online last year.

Google, which has a 2030 net-zero target date, called its climate targets “moonshots” and “ambition-based” in the latest report, both changes from its prior framing of the targets. The report documented an 11% decrease in year-over-year operational emissions — counting its scope 1 and 2 emissions — but when accompanied by a 22% increase in scope 3 emissions, the end result was an 11% increase in overall company emissions.",https://news.ballotpedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cropped-BP-logo-Initials-color-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-08 17:15:07.276727

What happens to power systems during extreme heat? Are blackouts inevitable as weather patterns intensify? What changes, if any, can help?

Eduard Muljadi, the Danaher Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializes in power systems resilience and shared his insights.

How do heat waves impact electricity demand and grid infrastructure?

Eduard Muljadi: When heat waves hit, electricity demand spikes—mainly because air conditioning units run harder and longer, not just in homes but in businesses and data centers. That increase puts a strain on the grid, particularly during peak hours in the late afternoon and early evening. At the same time, the grid’s infrastructure, especially transmission lines and transformers, is stressed by the heat itself. These components can overheat, lose efficiency and become more prone to failure. On the generation side, thermal power plants may have to reduce output because water supplies used for cooling are either too warm or too limited. Even renewables like solar and wind can see drops in performance during extreme heat, which further tightens the supply-demand balance.

What kinds of failures or bottlenecks are most likely during high-demand heat events?

Eduard Muljadi: It’s a combination of mechanical stress and mismatched supply. Transformers and substations can overheat after hours of sustained load, which leads to insulation breakdown or failure. Overhead lines can sag when they get hot, and if they contact vegetation, that can cause fires or outages. Underground cables face similar thermal expansion problems. Generation also suffers — thermal plants rely on cool water, and when it’s too warm or unavailable, output drops. Solar panels become less efficient at high temperatures. If generation can’t meet demand, you start to see voltage and frequency instability, which can lead to brownouts or rolling blackouts. Add to that outdated infrastructure and operational challenges — like forecasting errors or lack of regional coordination — and the system becomes extremely vulnerable.

Are blackouts inevitable in a hotter future, or can we engineer our way around that scenario?

Eduard Muljadi: Blackouts aren’t inevitable in a hotter future, but avoiding them requires bold engineering, smart policy and sustained investment. Without action, rising temperatures and demand will strain the grid beyond its limits. Modernizing infrastructure is key. Upgrading transmission lines with heat-resistant materials, reinforcing substations and deploying real-time monitoring can prevent failures. Upgrading overhead lines to underground lines and enhancing cooling systems also reduces heat-related risks. Expanding grid flexibility is equally vital. Utility-scale batteries, smart grid technologies and distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and storage can balance supply and demand. Virtual power plants and long-distance transmission lines improve resilience. Managing demand helps, too. Programs that shift usage away from peak hours, energy-efficient buildings and updated building codes reduce stress on the system. Time-of-use pricing can guide consumer behavior. Finally, supportive policies like streamlined permitting, market reforms and regional coordination are essential. With the right tools and commitment, we can engineer a future where blackouts are the exception, not the rule.

Are some types of power sources more resistant to extreme heat than others?

Eduard Muljadi: Yes, and it’s important to understand those differences. Traditional thermal power plants — coal, gas and nuclear — are very sensitive to heat because they need water for cooling. During a heat wave or drought, their output often drops. Solar panels produce less power as they heat up, sometimes losing up to 15 percent of their efficiency. Wind is more mixed. Hot air is less dense, which reduces power generation, but wind patterns vary. Hydropower is fairly heat-resilient but depends on water availability. Batteries are sensitive to temperature, too, but most are designed with thermal controls. The key takeaway is that no one source is immune to heat, which is why having a diverse mix and strong backup systems is crucial.

Are aging transformers and substations the weak link, or are transmission constraints more pressing?

Eduard Muljadi: It’s not one or the other — it’s both, and they’re interconnected. Many of our transformers and substations are operating well past their intended lifespan. They can’t dissipate heat as effectively under high loads, which leads to breakdowns. At the same time, transmission lines face their own limits. When lines heat up, resistance increases, and they sag sometimes dangerously close to vegetation. To prevent fires or damage, operators reduce how much power those lines can carry. That creates bottlenecks, especially when you’re trying to move electricity from one region to another. So, you’ve got aging equipment on one end, and limited flexibility on the other. Repairing one without the other doesn’t solve the problem.

What kinds of grid upgrades or policies are urgently needed to prepare for future extreme heat?

Eduard Muljadi: We need to build a grid that’s smarter, stronger and more flexible. That means investing in large-scale battery storage, improving transmission lines so they can handle higher loads and modernizing substations with better cooling systems and monitoring tools. Smart grid technologies like real-time metering and automated fault detection can make the system more responsive. On the policy side, we need faster permitting for new infrastructure, incentives for utilities to modernize and stronger demand-response programs. Updating building codes to improve insulation and reduce cooling needs is also key. On a broader level, regional coordination and domestic manufacturing of critical components will help build resilience across the board. We need a rapid and coordinated transformation because the risks are growing faster than we’re currently responding.

What can residents do to prepare or even help reduce the threat of grid failure?

For county officials, farmland loss is a growing national concern, with implications that stretch beyond the farm gate. Since 1997, the U.S. has lost more than 75 million acres of farmland to development, a trend driven by a surge of competing land use demands, including housing development, energy, and commercial and industrial growth, most recently from data centers.

As our use and reliance on new technologies – and subsequently energy demand – has grown, largescale renewable energy development has emerged as a rapidly growing driver of farmland loss. While these technologies hold promise for local economic development, community resilience and producers looking to diversify their income, it also raises urgent questions about the future of agricultural communities.

With authority over zoning, permitting and land use in many states, county leaders are charged with balancing long-term community needs with individual property rights. These decisions unfold within a complex web of federal, state, local and tribal policies, making land use one of the most layered and contentious policy arenas in county government.

The recent shift in federal focus toward securing U.S. energy dominance through expanded domestic energy production has further underscored the urgency for counties to develop balanced, locally driven strategies for energy development. Counties believe that local, state and federal policy must guide energy development in ways that support economic opportunity and energy resilience while protecting agricultural viability.

As frontline decision-makers, county governments are facing the challenge of shaping how energy and agriculture can coexist. With thoughtful planning, comprehensive engagement and adaptive policy tools, county officials can ensure renewable energy development strengthens, rather than supplants, the agricultural foundation of America.

KEY FINDINGS

Rapid Growth in Renewable Energy: The U.S. renewable energy sector is expanding rapidly, driven by technological advancements, public investment and surging electricity demand, particularly from high-intensity industrial uses like data centers. Solar energy is projected to account for nearly three-quarters of renewable electricity generation growth by the end of 2025.

Farmland at Risk: The U.S. has lost nearly onetenth of the nation’s total farmland since 1997, equivalent to the farmland in Iowa and Indiana combined. Utility-scale renewable energy development, particularly solar, represents a growing contributor to farmland conversion.

Counties at a Crossroads: County officials face unique challenges in balancing renewable energy projects with farmland preservation, including competing land uses, rights of property owners, broader community economic benefits (including local tax revenues), environmental impacts and complex regulatory landscapes.

Solar energy is cheap, fast to deploy, and produces virtually no pollution during its operation.

As the nonpartisan energy think tank RMI has argued, the world is in the midst of a transition from the Information Age, which the United States led by dominating the development of new software and information technologies, to the Renewable Age, in which the development and deployment of electric and renewable energy technologies will drive the global economy.

This transition is dominated by insurgent clean technologies, such as solar, wind, electric vehicles, and batteries, whose prices are falling rapidly and whose growth is exponential.

Chinese manufacturers have invested heavily in those technologies. To help the U.S. economy better compete in the clean tech sector, Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, in August 2022. That law included incentives to spur domestic manufacturing of these key clean energy technologies.

And it was working.

The U.S. experienced a clean energy manufacturing boom over the ensuing two years. But Republicans’ new budget reconciliation law, called the “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act,” guts those incentives and pulls the rug out from under nascent domestic clean energy industries.

On America’s birthday, President Donald Trump could not have given the Chinese economy a more generous gift.

Chinese manufacturers are dominating the EV market

The United States has the world’s second-largest car market, but EVs account for less than 10% of the country’s new auto sales. That can give U.S. residents the mistaken impression that EVs are unpopular.

In fact, more than one in five new passenger cars sold around the world in 2024 were electric. BloombergNEF, a market research firm, forecasts that this share will rise to about one in four new cars this year. That could rise to four out of every 10 by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. In other words, the global auto market is increasingly electric.

China has the largest domestic auto market in the world, and half the new vehicles sold in the country today are EVs. And Chinese automakers are dominating the global EV market, offering a wide array of affordable and advanced cars. The electric car giant BYD’s cheapest model, the Seagull, is priced at less than $10,000, dramatically undercutting U.S.-based companies like Tesla.

Ford CEO Jim Farley recently described Chinese EVs as “far superior to what I see in the West.” He added that if his company loses the EV market to Chinese automakers, “We do not have a future Ford.”

Former President Joe Biden placed a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs to protect the U.S. domestic industry. And U.S. demand for EVs was expected to grow rapidly in the coming years as the result of federal tax credits for American-made electric cars and U.S. tailpipe pollution regulations.

But Republicans’ new budget law will terminate the former on September 30, and the Trump administration has gutted the latter.

As a result, energy systems modelers at Princeton and BloombergNEF project that only about half as many U.S. residents will buy EVs over the next five years as previously expected. By 2030, only about 27% of new car sales in the U.S. are now expected to be electric, compared to 80% in China.

Chinese firms are winning the solar market, too

The story is similar for solar panels. Solar energy is cheap, fast to deploy, and produces virtually no pollution during its operation. It accounted for about 70% of all new global power generation capacity added in 2024, including nearly 60% in the United States.

Chinese firms control over 80% of the global solar panel manufacturing supply chain, according to the International Energy Agency.

The IRA aimed to bolster the U.S. solar manufacturing industry, in part through clean electricity tax credits. But as a result of the Republican budget law’s rapid phaseout of those incentives, the U.S. will deploy about 40% less clean energy over the next decade, according to modeling by experts at Princeton. Companies like U.S. solar manufacturer Talon PV have already begun pausing or canceling U.S. projects in anticipation of the clean energy tax credit repeals, as well as other uncertainties like Trump’s unpredictable tariffs.

When the IRA became law, there was a surge in planned battery, EV, and solar manufacturing investments, according to a project to track clean energy manufacturing announcements by a team at Wellesley College. That was followed by a steep decline since last November’s elections and associated threats to clean energy incentives.

Energy Innovation, a Yale Climate Connections content-sharing partner, anticipates that the repealed clean energy tax credits will cost 760,000 jobs by 2030 and reduce the country’s gross domestic product by nearly a trillion dollars.

The budget reconciliation law gives the Chinese economy other advantages

The big budget law will likely cause a tremendous number of other negative impacts. Because clean energy deployment will slow down at a time when power demand is rising rapidly and natural gas turbines are facing years of delivery backlogs, experts warn it will create energy scarcity. American companies will likely be left scrambling to find enough supply to meet rising power demand, which will lead to higher electricity bills and put U.S. artificial intelligence developers at a disadvantage in their high-stakes race against their Chinese competitors.

Increasing the country’s reliance on fossil fuels will also result in more air pollution and sicker U.S. residents, coinciding with at least 17 million people losing their health coverage and more than 300 hospitals facing the risk of closure, the result of other provisions in the GOP’s new law.

The Senate made the bill 25% less damaging to the climate

As harmful as the final law is, it was very nearly considerably worse for the climate. The version initially passed by the House would have effectively immediately gutted the clean electricity tax credits. It was so damaging that 13 House Republicans pleaded with their Senate colleagues to fix the bill they had all just voted for.

The Senate Finance Committee did indeed make some improvements, softening the requirements for clean electricity to qualify for the tax credits and significantly extending their timeline for sources other than solar and wind.

Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Chuck Grassley (Iowa), and John Curtis (Utah) reportedly negotiated a last-minute amendment to the bill that added a one-year runway for new solar and wind projects to begin construction and still qualify for the full clean electricity tax credits.

The Princeton modelers estimated that compared to the status quo, the House version of the bill would have added about 2.7 billion tons of climate pollution to the atmosphere while increasing average U.S. household energy bills by more than $2,000 over the coming decade. The final bill passed by the Senate and signed into law by Trump is projected to instead add 2.1 billion tons of climate pollution and cost U.S. households a bit under $1,700 in higher energy bills over the next decade.

That’s about 25% less costly than the House version – both to pocketbooks and to the climate.

But it’s considerably worse than the status quo of Biden-era policies and regulations, in which the accelerated deployment of cheap solar and wind energy was expected to reduce household energy bills by about $600 over the next decade.

And on its new course, the U.S. will exceed its 2030 Paris commitment by 7 billion tons of climate pollution, according to an analysis by Carbon Brief.

Given the slimmest of margins by which the bill passed the Senate, any Republican senator could have sent the bill back to the drawing board by simply voting no. Sen. Murkowski instead chose to cast the deciding vote after extracting a variety of concessions for her state and clean energy incentives, before pleading with the House to further fix the bill whose passage she had ensured.

A bill everyone dislikes, except Chinese manufacturers

Because of the sprawling nature of the big budget law, it has something for just about everyone to dislike. And indeed, polls have consistently found that Americans oppose the bill by a nearly two-to-one margin.

Whether it be higher energy costs, lost domestic manufacturing, jobs, and economic growth, the ballooning of the national debt, energy scarcity, drastic cuts to the social safety net, exacerbated income inequality, or an extra 2 billion tons of climate pollution, there may only be one group that loves the big budget bill. As Energy Innovation’s Senior Director of Modeling and Analysis Robbie Orvis put it:

“To sum it up, this bill is a GIFT to China, which must be smiling right now watching what’s happening. We are gifting them the industries of the future, making the U.S. an eminently harder place to invest in, and decreasing our energy security.”",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/725-big-beautiful-bill-climate-change-china-GettyImages-2223602541.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:14.424792

Plastic waste is a global problem that has challenged society for nearly 75 years.
NETL’s solution diverts plastics from waste streams into the manufacturing supply chain where the material can be used more beneficially and economically.
The newly funded process joins the Lab’s other patent-pending technology to upcycle plastic waste and use it as a manufacturing feedstock for making a range of high-value, solid-carbon materials, including supercapacitors.
“By producing solid carbon materials, such as graphite, from waste plastic, we can sequester the waste in a high-quality product with a longer service life than the single-use plastics it is produced from.","NETL has received funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Critical Materials Innovation Hub to expand research that transforms single-use water bottles, shopping bags and other waste plastic into a valuable, unconventional feedstock for manufacturing high-quality graphite.

“Graphite is a critical mineral needed by U.S. manufacturers to produce lithium-ion battery anodes for vehicles, military drones, backup power systems and more,” said NETL researcher Yuan Gao. “Working with partners through the DOE Critical Materials Innovation Hub will help establish a strong domestic supply chain of high-quality graphite while transforming polyethylene (PE) waste into a valuable resource.”

NETL’s unique process provides a simple method to turn PE into graphite that is comparable or higher quality than commercially available synthetic graphite.

The process diverts single-use plastics and other PE waste from the world’s oceans and landfills into the manufacturing sector, where it can be utilized for beneficial, revenue-generating purposes and help generate a strong domestic supply of a critical mineral needed to support U.S. national and economic security.

Funds awarded through the DOE Critical Materials Innovation Hub will enable NETL’s Carbon Materials Manufacturing team to continue a partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Ames National Laboratory and Ingevity, a global corporation headquartered in North Charleston, South Carolina.

The partnership was launched in January 2024 to convert PE waste and lignin (biomass generated by paper manufacturing and other plant-based industries) into pure and highly crystalline graphite suitable for energy-related applications, including battery anodes for fast-charging application in electric vehicles.

The goal of the upcoming work is to convert biomass-derived carbon and plastic waste-derived carbon char into graphite using a simplified chemical process that employs machine learning to screen process variables and determine the optimal value to use for each.

Plastic waste is a global problem that has challenged society for nearly 75 years. More than 7.8 billion tons of plastic have been produced since the 1950s, which is approximately one ton of plastic for every person alive. While some recycling methods exist, they are generally limited to waste streams that are relatively uncontaminated with food, dyes and additives.

Additionally, traditional recycling causes the deterioration of polymer properties. This deterioration means that plastics can only be recycled a few times before their technical and economic value is lost. Due, in part, to these limitations, only 6-7% of the plastic ever produced has been recycled.

NETL’s solution diverts plastics from waste streams into the manufacturing supply chain where the material can be used more beneficially and economically. The newly funded process joins the Lab’s other patent-pending technology to upcycle plastic waste and use it as a manufacturing feedstock for making a range of high-value, solid-carbon materials, including supercapacitors.

“By producing solid carbon materials, such as graphite, from waste plastic, we can sequester the waste in a high-quality product with a longer service life than the single-use plastics it is produced from. In the case of graphite used in batteries, the product can be recovered and reused at the end of device life, which extends the graphite service life even further,” said Christopher Matranga, a senior NETL researcher on the project.

The Critical Materials Innovation Hub was established in 2013 and is led by Ames National Laboratory as a sustained, multidisciplinary effort to develop solutions across the materials life cycle as well as reduce the impact of supply chain disruptions and price fluctuations associated with these valuable resources.

The OBBBA makes tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, in some cases with certain adjustments. The OBBBA also includes new tax provisions for individuals and businesses, and rolls back certain tax incentives adopted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

Below we summarize key business and individual tax provisions included in the OBBBA. Please note: This summary is based on a preliminary review of the bill, a lengthy and complex piece of legislation. This information will be updated as we continue to review the legislation and as new details emerge.

SALT Cap Temporarily Increased

The deduction cap for state and local taxes is increased to $40,000 for 2025 for taxpayers making less than $500,000 and will increase by 1% for each of the years 2026 through 2029 before reverting back to $10,000 in 2030. For taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $500,000, the $40,000 cap is phased downward (but not below $10,000) for years 2025 through 2029. No specific provisions regarding the application of pass-through entity tax were included in the bill.

New Deductions for Tip Income and Overtime Pay for Tax Years 2025 through 2028

The OBBBA provides new temporary deductions for tips and overtime pay. The new deduction for tip income is available to individuals regardless of whether or not they itemize their deductions, and applies to tips received from customers for services in industries where tips are customary. The deduction is limited to $25,000, with a phase-out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers). Those in a “specified service trade or business” are excluded — for example, those in the fields of health, law, accounting, actuarial services, performing arts, consulting, athletics, banking, financial and brokerage services, and farming cannot take advantage of the deduction.

Additionally, the FICA tip credit for employers is now expanded to include those in the beauty services and food and beverage industries.

The new deduction for overtime pay is also available to individuals regardless of whether or not they itemize their deductions. The deduction is limited to $12,500 of qualified overtime income ($25,000 for joint filers), with a phase-out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers).

Expansion of Business Expensing

The OBBBA permanently restores 100% bonus depreciation for certain qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025 (includes depreciable property with a recovery period of 20 years or less and qualified improvement property). The bill permanently restores the immediate expensing of domestic research or experimental expenditures for amounts paid or incurred beginning January 1, 2025, with an election to amortize certain expenditures over not less than 60 months. The Section 179 annual expense limit is increased to $2.5M, reduced by expenditures for §179 property that exceed $4M.

Other Major Highlights: What Tax Provisions are Included?

Makes permanent current individual income tax rates and brackets (with a top income tax rate of 37%), with inflation adjustments for the 10%, 12% and 22% brackets.

The standard deduction is permanently increased — it will be $15,750 for single taxpayers ($31,500 for joint filers) beginning in 2025.

Miscellaneous itemized deductions are now permanently eliminated (i.e., unreimbursed employee expenses, tax preparation fees, etc.), with a new exception for certain unreimbursed educator expenses.

Personal exemptions are permanently eliminated. Seniors (ages 65 and older) are allowed a deduction of $6,000 for years 2025 through 2028, to be phased out if modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 for joint filers).

Certain mortgage insurance premiums will now qualify as acquisition indebtedness for purposes of the mortgage interest deduction.

The casualty loss deduction is permanently limited, with a new exception for state-declared disasters.

The calculation for limitation of the business interest deduction is now permanent.

The 199A business income deduction is permanently extended, now with increased phase-in for income limits beginning in 2026, and a $400 (adjusted for inflation) minimum deduction for those taxpayers with a minimum of $1,000 of qualifying income from certain trades or businesses. The deduction limit phase-in range for specified service trades or businesses and other taxpayers subject to the wage and investment limitation is expanded to $150,000 for joint filers and $75,000 for single filers.

Noncorporate taxpayer’s limitation on excess business losses is permanently extended, with the income threshold for determining an excess business loss now adjusted for inflation.

Provides for a new temporary car loan interest deduction up to $10,000 for vehicles the final assembly of which occurs in the United States.

Dependent care assistant program flex-spending account limits are increased to $7,500.

The child tax credit is increased to $2,200, with annual adjustments for inflation.

Alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption is increased permanently to $1,000,000 for joint filers ($500,000 for single filers), indexed for inflation, and adjusts the phaseout exemption amount from 25% to 50% after 2025.

Beginning in 2026, taxpayers who do not itemize deductions are allowed a charitable contribution deduction of up to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers). For taxpayers who itemize deductions, charitable deductions are allowed in excess of 0.5% of the taxpayer’s contribution base (adjusted gross income, without taking into account any charitable gifts).

Revises the §1202 small business stock exclusion to allow a partial exclusion of 50% of gain from the sale of qualified small business stock issued after the date of enactment that is held for at least three years; 75% exclusion if held for at least four years; and a 100% exclusion if held for at least five years. The gross asset limitation to qualify is increased to $75M, and the per-taxpayer gain exclusion cap is increased to $15M.

Permanently extends Opportunity Zone tax benefits. Qualified Opportunity Zones will now be redesignated every 10 years beginning in 2026. Deferred gain on investments made after January 1, 2027, will be recognized on the earlier of five years or disposition of the investment. A 10% basis increase is allowed if held for five years. No tax is imposed on investment gains if the qualified investment is held for at least 10 years and up to 30 years.

Estate tax exemptions are increased to $15 million ($30 million for joint filers).

International tax updates include changes to rules applicable to controlled foreign corporations, the foreign tax credit and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) regime, and certain changes in rates and deduction percentages, beginning in 2026.

President Donald Trump signed wide-ranging tax legislation, P.L. 119-21 (the Legislation) on July 4, 2025.

The Legislation includes net tax cuts of $4.5 trillion and spending cuts of $1.2 trillion, for a cost compared with current law of approximately $3.3 trillion over the 10-year budget window.

The Legislation will affect nearly every sector of the economy and every type of taxpayer, including individuals, corporations, pass-through entities and tax-exempt organizations.

The race to remake portions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and to prevent expiration of certain Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions reached completion with Legislation signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025. The Legislation combines spending and policy priorities from 11 congressional committees and will reshape federal policy across nearly every sector of the U.S. economy.

With respect to taxes, notable provisions include the following: The Legislation makes permanent most of the expiring provisions of the TCJA; makes permanent changes to U.S. corporate international tax provisions; makes permanent the allowance for domestic research and development (R&D) expensing and bonus depreciation; allows immediate expensing for the cost of certain manufacturing facilities; phases out early or repeals certain Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) renewable energy credits; modifies the excess business loss calculation; permanently renews and expands Qualified Opportunity Zones, the New Markets Tax Credits and low-income housing credits; increases the investment credit for semiconductor manufacturers for certain new facilities; restores Section 958(b)(4) prospectively and in a modified manner; allows oil and gas companies to exempt intangible drilling and development costs when calculating their corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT); increases the maximum of a real estate investment trust’s (REIT’s) assets that may be held through taxable subsidiary corporations; treats spaceports like airports for purposes of the exempt-facility bond rules; increases taxes on net investment income of certain private college and university endowments; makes permanent (with certain limited enhancements) the 37 percent individual top tax rate; increases and makes permanent the child tax credit; increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for certain taxpayers through 2029; increases and makes permanent the standard deduction and Section 199A; adds on a temporary basis various provisions promised by President Trump on the campaign trail, including eliminating taxes on certain tips and overtime, allowing for the deduction of auto loan interest for certain new cars, and providing a bonus standard deduction for seniors to help offset the cost of taxation of certain Social Security income; establishes Trump investment accounts for children; permanently increases the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million; caps the value of itemized deductions at 35 percent and places a floor on itemized deductions of charitable contributions; adds a 1 percent floor on the corporate deduction of charitable contributions and a one percent remittance tax on certain transferors who send money abroad and tightens restrictions regarding the employee retention credit.

The Legislation did not make any changes to carried interest or the corporate or capital gains tax rates, did not reduce the corporate rate for U.S. manufacturing (but does allow full immediate expensing of certain manufacturing facilities), does not repeal the stock buyback tax or the corporate AMT, and contains no limitation on corporate deductions of state or local taxes. Unlike certain earlier drafts, the Legislation dropped the proposed Section 899 revenge tax, dropped the proposed attack on passthrough entity SALT deduction work-arounds, dropped the proposed 41 percent punitive tax on litigation funding, dropped the proposed excise tax on wind and solar projects that received certain assistance from foreign entities of concern (FEOC), dropped the proposed moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence, dropped proposals relating to sales of public lands, and dropped a proposed amendment to Section 7213 to increase criminal penalties in cases of unauthorized disclosure of certain private tax return information. The Legislation did not make the more taxpayer-friendly changes to Section 163(j) that were originally proposed by the House; Public Law 86-272 modernization protections relating to taxation by states also were not included in the Legislation. There is likely to be one or more additional reconciliation bills during late 2025 and 2026 and therefore additional opportunities for enactment of additional provisions, as well as changes and improvements to the Legislation. And the importance of engaging with the IRS and Treasury as they develop guidance to implement some of the more complex provisions cannot be overstated.

Bonus Depreciation

The Legislation permanently extends and modifies Section 168 first-year (bonus) depreciation, generally allowing 100 percent depreciation in the first year for certain property acquired and placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. The Legislation also makes permanent the percentage of completion method for allocation of bonus depreciation to long-term contracts.

Immediate Expensing for Qualified Production Property

To encourage domestic manufacturing and production, the Legislation contains a special provision for qualified production property that allows for the immediate expensing of 100 percent of the adjusted basis of the qualified production property, including 39-year factory (manufacturing) property.

Qualified production property means the portion of any nonresidential real property (1) used as an integral part of a qualified production activity; (2) placed in service in the U.S.; and (3) whose original use begins with the taxpayer. The construction of the property must begin after Jan. 19, 2025, and before Jan. 1, 2029. The property must be placed in service after the date of enactment and before Jan. 1, 2031. Qualifying production activities include manufacturing, production or refining of tangible personal property and agricultural or chemical production.

Increased Dollar Limitations for Expensing of Certain Depreciable Business Assets

The Legislation allows for immediate expensing under Section 179 of the cost of qualifying property up to $2.5 million, with a phaseout threshold that begins to reduce the deductible amount when costs exceed $4 million for property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2024. Under current law, up to $1 million may be expensed and the phaseout threshold amount is $2.5 million.

In general, qualifying property is defined as depreciable tangible personal property, off-the-shelf computer software and qualified real property that is purchased for use in the active conduct of a trade or business.

Research and Development

Since 2022, taxpayers have been required to capitalize and amortize U.S.-based research or experimental expenditures ratably over a five-year period and non-U.S.-based research or experimental expenditures ratably over a 15-year period. These include costs to develop or improve a product, including software. Examples of costs are the salaries of the persons engaged in the research or experimentation efforts, overhead incurred to operate and maintain the facility, and materials and supplies that are consumed in the course of the research or experimental activities. The requirement to capitalize and amortize these costs has been a source of contention since 2022.

The Legislation permanently suspends the capitalization of domestic research or experimental expenditures for amounts paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. However, a taxpayer may elect to capitalize and amortize the expenditures by filing an election with its tax return. This is an important election for some taxpayers, who benefit more from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) -- which permanently lowers their tax rate -- when they capitalize (a mere timing issue) R&D expenditures. Foreign research or experimental expenditures still must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period.

Business Interest Deductibility

Under the TCJA, Section 163(j) generally limited the amount of business interest that a taxpayer may deduct (1) business interest income, (2) to 30 percent of its “adjusted taxable income” (ATI) and (3) certain interest associated with vehicle inventory financing. The Legislation makes limited incremental adjustments to Section 163(j) by explicitly requiring the provision’s coordination with interest capitalization rules and by statutorily mandating that ATI will be computed without considering amounts related to offshore operations (e.g., subpart F or global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) inclusions). The changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

The Legislation marks a departure from the more taxpayer-friendly changes to Section 163(j) that were originally proposed by the House. In the House’s original text, the determination of ATI – which under the TCJA was essentially defined as EBITDA until calendar year 2023, and EBIT thereafter – would have brought back the “DA” by again equating ATI with EBITDA for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. The original House text also would have extended vehicle inventory financing benefits to recreational vehicle dealers for calendar years 2025 and beyond.

FDII (Renamed FDDEI)

The most substantive changes to FDII include (1) permanently modifying the FDII deduction rate to 33.34 percent (i.e., eliminating a scheduled reduction to a 21.875 percent deduction rate beginning in calendar year 2026), thereby making the effective rate of FDII approximately 14 percent, (2) eliminating the hurdle related to qualified business asset investment (QBAI) that taxpayers were required to overcome in order to enjoy FDII benefits, and (3) modifying the relevant computational rules so that interest and research expenditures are no longer allocated against FDII-qualified income. While the final bill modestly increases the overall rate applicable to FDII relative to the original House version, its targeting of certain key TCJA-related structural deficiencies that have plagued the FDII regime’s operation is very taxpayer friendly and is certain to further enhance the attractiveness of the regime. These FDII changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

The Legislation also makes changes to FDII that seeks to limit a taxpayer’s ability to benefit from the regime when offshoring intellectual property or other valuable assets. Historically, gains and royalties arising from outbound disposals of intellectual property to foreign affiliates (e.g., due to a sale or Section 367(d) contributions) could qualify for favorable FDII rates; however, this result arguably ran counter to FDII objectives aimed at encouraging U.S. multinationals to onshore intellectual property following the enactment of the TCJA. Accordingly, the Legislation eliminates the ability to claim FDII benefits for any disposals of intellectual property or other valuable assets to foreign affiliates, with effect for dispositions (including deemed dispositions) occurring after June 16, 2025. The Legislation does not include language contained in the earlier Senate version that would have made passive income – such as income of a type similar to foreign personal holding company income (for instance, certain royalties paid by a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) for local exploitation) – ineligible for FDII benefits. Such a limitation arguably would have been contrary to the objectives of FDII (e.g., to encourage holding intellectual property in the U.S.) and would have diminished the benefits of the FDII regime.

Finally, the Legislation changes the name of FDII to “Foreign-Derived Deduction-Eligible Income.”

The Legislation repeals the scheduled increase in the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which was scheduled to increase from 10 percent to 12.5 percent for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, and instead permanently adopts a slightly higher 10.5 percent rate that applies for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. The Legislation does not include “super” BEAT provisions – which would have increased the rate to 14 percent and made the provision applicable to more taxpayers – that were included in the Senate’s original legislative draft.

GILTI (Renamed Net CFC Tested Income)

The Legislation seeks to improve the operation of GILTI by making several modifications to the regime, including by addressing certain TCJA-related structural deficiencies that have plagued GILTI since its origin and by eliminating certain computational elements that might be perceived as incentivizing offshore (rather than onshore) manufacturing. The Legislation’s most substantive changes to GILTI include (1) permanently modifying the GILTI deduction rate to 40 percent (i.e., eliminating a scheduled reduction to a 37.5 percent deduction rate beginning in calendar year 2026), thereby making GILTI’s effective rate 12.6 percent (assuming GILTI earnings are not subject to foreign tax), (2) permanently reducing the GILTI haircut on deemed paid foreign taxes from 20 percent to 10 percent, with the result that GILTI-related earnings that bear a 14 percent effective rate of foreign tax should not be subject to residual federal income taxation, (3) eliminating the QBAI-related tax-free return that taxpayers had enjoyed following the TCJA, and (4) modifying the relevant foreign tax credit limitation provisions so that various expenses (particularly those associated with interest and research expenditures) are allocated and apportioned to U.S. source income rather than to income otherwise belonging to the GILTI basket. As with FDII, the Legislation operates to modestly increase the overall rate applicable to GILTI relative to the original House version; however, its targeting of various statutory deficiencies that have plagued the intended operation of GILTI generally is taxpayer friendly. While the elimination of the QBAI-related tax-free return may impact certain U.S. multinationals (e.g., energy companies where offshore CAPEX costs can be significant), many taxpayers may find the elimination of the QBAI benefit a relatively modest price to pay for the more significant improvements to the GILTI regime. These GILTI-related changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Implications Regarding Pillar 1 and Pillar 2

The Legislation and related tariff actions make clear, as expected, that the U.S. Congress and the Trump administration believe Pillar 1 is dead and have no intention of aligning U.S. tax laws with Pillar 2. Treasury officials have stated that the U.S. tax system is robust enough that other countries should refrain from applying the 15 percent global minimum tax (Pillar 2) to any income that the U.S. taxes. To make these points explicit, earlier versions of the legislative text from both the House and the Senate included a new Code Section 899, which was aimed at discouraging foreign countries from enacting and applying discriminatory, extraterritorial or similar taxes that disproportionately had a direct or indirect impact on U.S. persons. This new statutory provision specifically would have targeted foreign countries that enact undertaxed profits rules (UTPRs), digital services taxes (DSTs), diverted profits taxes and similar measures. When applicable, the provision would generally modify the regular U.S. tax rates applicable to the governments of, and individuals and companies tax resident in, such “discriminatory foreign countries” by incrementally increasing the rate by 5 percentage points each year (but capping the overall increase at 15 or 20 percentage points). The provision garnered significant attention, and despite its similarity to a UTPR (i.e., an in terrorem tax rule designed to encourage other countries to adjust their local tax laws to avoid its application), many Europe-based stakeholders complained that new Section 899 would significantly impact historic investments in the U.S. and would possibly impede future direct investment.

In late June 2025, after holding a series of negotiations with other countries, the U.S. Treasury Secretary made a request that the Senate remove Section 899 from the bill due to a pending G-7 agreement to permit side-by-side co-existence of Pillar 2 and the U.S. tax system (including GILTI, as currently configured, without country-by-country application). On June 28, 2025, representatives of the G-7 countries issued a statement confirming their commitment to this side-by-side agreement, and while precise details are not yet fully known the stated objective is that U.S. multinationals will not be subject to Pillar 2’s UTPRs or “income inclusion rules” in respect of U.S. and foreign source earnings. Given this agreement, the final bill does not include Section 899. While the side-by-side agreement must still be formalized and adopted by the OECD-led Inclusive Framework, the commitment made by the G-7 countries and the possibility for a second reconciliation bill in late 2025 should ensure that the agreement is made durable.

In late June 2025, Canada also agreed to rescind its DST in order to continue tariff negotiations with the U.S. After many delayed effective dates, Canada’s DST was first due on June 30, 2025, covering revenues earned since January 1, 2022. Taxpayers who filed and made payments with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) before the June 30th deadline and before Canada’s agreement to rescind the DST should receive refunds once Canada’s Parliament returns from its summer break in mid-September and formally repeals the DST. CRA has stated that it lacks legal authority to refund DST payments absent legislation.

Other International Tax Changes

The Legislation includes a number of other changes to U.S. international tax rules that were not in the original House text. The most notable international tax changes in the final bill include:

More Favorable U.S.-Production Sourcing Rules

The Legislation seeks to enhance the sourcing rules for U.S. produced inventory, by permitting up to 50 percent of the income associated therewith to be treated as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes notwithstanding the final sentence of Section 863(b) (which sources entirely based on location of production).

Reinstatement of Section 958(b)(4) and Enactment of New Section 951B

The Legislation reinstates Section 958(b)(4), which was repealed by the TCJA, on a prospective-only basis for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, and with modifications to the manner it will apply going forward. Before the TCJA, that section functioned to block downward attributions of stock ownership in the context of determining which corporations were CFCs. The Legislation enacts new Section 951B to implement the new and targeted approach, again prospectively only for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025. There were various winners and losers associated with the TCJA’s repeal of Section 958(b)(4) and Congress previously determined on numerous occasions not to reinstate Section 958(b)(4).

Elimination of the Section 898 One-Month Deferral Election

The Legislation eliminates the possibility of electing a one-month deferral for the required U.S. tax year of U.S.-owned foreign corporations (generally CFCs). The provision arguably seeks to eliminate on a going-forward basis tax year-end change planning that was prevalent following the adoption of the TCJA. It is effective for tax years of specified foreign corporations beginning after Nov. 30, 2025.

Permanent CFC “Look-Through” Under Section 954(c)(6)

The Legislation makes permanent the subpart F “look-through” rule for payments from related CFCs.

Modification of the Subpart F -- GILTI “Pro Rata” Rules

The Legislation makes significant changes to the subpart F and GILTI “pro rata” rules under Sections 951(a) and 951A. Most significantly, the revised rules no longer (1) trigger inclusions solely for U.S. shareholders that own a CFC on the last day of the CFC year, or (2) allow distributions to operate to reduce or eliminate taxable income. The changes arguably target Section 951(a)(2)(B) and similar planning techniques that were popular following the adoption of the TCJA, and because the changes are anti-abuse in nature there are transition rules relating to actual and deemed dividends that may have an immediate impact on current year tax results.

Foreign Tax Credit Limitations for Previously Taxed Earnings and Profits (PTEP) Distributions

The Legislation makes it clear that foreign taxes otherwise associated with the GILTI haircut (e.g., the 10 percent haircut applied to foreign taxes for deemed paid tax purposes) cannot be claimed on a subsequent distribution of PTEP. The changes arguably target foreign tax credit planning that may have been possible due to revisions to Section 960 made in connection with the enactment of the TCJA. Because the changes are anti-abuse in nature, they are effective for amounts distributed after June 28, 2025.

Except as otherwise noted above, these changes are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Modifications to Renewable Energy Provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act

The Legislation significantly modifies and in some instances repeals various renewable energy credits and provisions that were enacted as part of the IRA. These changes generated enormous amounts of revenue that were integral to offsetting the Legislation’s deficit generating provisions. The modifications include the adoption of “prohibited foreign entity” rules that prevent certain entities that either are owned or have commercial ties with persons from covered nations (i.e., China, North Korea, Russia and Iran) from claiming renewable energy credits contained in the IRA. The modifications also include the adoption of “material assistance” rules that prevent eligibility for certain credits where a prohibited foreign entity materially assisted with manufacturing or construction. What follows is a summary of the most significant changes and portions of an executive Order issued by President Trump on July 7th.

Prohibited Foreign Entities and Material Assistance

The prohibited foreign entity rules are the culmination of prior legislative attempts to restrict and prevent certain foreign owned or controlled entities from benefiting from U.S. federal income tax credits. In many respects, however, the enacted rules go beyond prior attempts by targeting not just certain foreign-owned entities but also commercial transactions and ties with certain foreign-owned companies. The rules broadly apply to renewable energy credits in three situations.

The first situation relates to “specified foreign entities,” which is generally defined as an entity that is related to or controlled (through stock or equity) by the government, companies, or individuals of covered nations (as defined above).

The second situation is for entities that are “foreign-influenced entities,” which targets ownership (similar to the definition of a specified foreign entity) and commercial transactions and relationships with a prohibited foreign entity. The definition generally causes an entity to be considered a foreign-influenced entity (and in turn a prohibited foreign entity) if a separate prohibited foreign entity has the ability to direct or decide matters affecting management or operations of the entity. Whether an entity is a foreign-influenced entity is subjective and requires an analysis of the entity’s capital structure (debt and equity), contracts for materials or manufactured goods, and other arrangements such as licensing agreements. The entity’s contracts and other arrangements must be analyzed to determine whether a prohibited foreign entity has the ability to exercise “effective control” over aspects of the entity’s management or certain business affairs.

The final situation involves whether an entity receives “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity. If an entity does receive “material assistance,” either products it makes will not qualify as eligible components under Section 45X or the facility that is being constructed will not qualify as a qualified facility for purposes of production and investment tax credits.

The Legislation adopted material assistance rules that analyze cost ratio thresholds for manufactured products and facilities. The cost ratio is calculated based on the total direct material costs paid or incurred by the manufacturer of an eligible component or developer of a facility to a prohibited foreign entity over the total amount of direct costs paid or incurred. If the ratio is above a statutorily defined threshold, the manufactured product or the facility are ineligible for certain renewable energy credits. The final legislation defines the relevant cost ratios and states that taxpayers may in the interim rely on existing IRS guidance relating to domestic content until additional guidance is issued.

The prohibited foreign entity rules take effect in the taxable year beginning after the enactment of the Legislation. The material assistance rules apply to facilities the construction of which begins after Dec. 31, 2025 and to eligible components produced in the taxable year beginning after the date of enactment.

Clean Fuel Production Credit – Section 45Z

The clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z would be modified by the Legislation to require that feedstocks be produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. Previously, there were no sourcing requirements with respect to feedstocks, and clean fuel producers were therefore able to import feedstocks such as sugar cane from abroad. The Legislation also contains amendments to the greenhouse gas emissions requirements for land use changes and emissions rates for animal manure used as a feedstock. Finally, the Legislation extends the clean fuel production credit to Dec. 31, 2029, which aligns it with the modified phaseout and expiration dates made to other credits.

Clean Electricity Production Credit and Investment Tax Credit – Sections 45Y and 48E

The Legislation terminates the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment tax credit for all wind and solar energy property placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027. However, in a last minute change to the Legislation, the termination provision was amended to be effective for property the construction of which begins one-year after the enactment of the Legislation. Thus, projects that begin construction within the next year are not subject to the Dec. 31, 2027 placed-in service restriction. This provision generated enormous controversy when the Senate returned the Legislation to the House, and it remains to be seen how it will be implemented by Treasury and the IRS, including in light of the Executive Order discussed immediately below.

As noted above, the prohibited foreign entity and material assistance rules apply to all types of facilities eligible for clean electricity production and investment tax credits (i.e., biogas, energy storage, geothermal, etc.).

July 7th Executive Order Regarding “Beginning of Construction” and “FEOC”

President Trump issued an executive Order on July 7th stating, in Section 3 in relevant part:

“(a) Within 45 days following enactment…, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built,” and

“(b) Within 45 days following enactment…, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions….”

Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit – Section 45X

The Legislation contains minor revisions to Section 45X, including amendments to the definition of “battery module,” revisions to the rules for integrated components and the ability to “stack” Section 45X tax credits, and adding phaseouts to Section 45X tax credits for the production of critical minerals starting in 2031. As noted above, the prohibited foreign entity rules also apply to prohibit any manufacturer that meets the definition of a prohibited foreign entity from claiming a Section 45X credit. The material assistance rules also apply to prohibit any property manufactured with the material assistance of a prohibited foreign entity from qualifying as an eligible component for purposes of Section 45X.

Other IRA Credits

The Legislation repealed the Section 25E credits for previously owned clean vehicles, the Section 30D clean vehicle credit, the Section 45W commercial clean vehicle credit, the Section 30C alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, the Section 25C energy efficient home improvement credit, the Section 25D residential clean energy credit, and the Section 45L new energy efficient home credit. The repeals have various effective dates of either Sept. 30, 2025 (25E credits, 30D credits, and 45W credits), Dec. 31, 2025 (25C credits and 25D credits), or June 30, 2026 (30C credits and 45L credits). The Legislation also moved the termination date for Section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credits from Jan. 1, 2033 to Jan. 1, 2028.

Credits for Semiconductor Manufacturers

The Legislation increases the advanced manufacturing tax credit, including for semiconductor manufacturers, from 25 percent to 35 percent for certain new facilities.

SALT Cap and Retreat from Attack on Most SALT Cap Work-Arounds

Prior to the changes made by the TCJA, individuals were permitted generally to take a deduction against their federal gross income for the full amount of state, local and foreign income taxes paid. Under the TCJA, an individual’s itemized deductions for state, local and foreign income taxes were capped at $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately), beginning in 2018. This so-called “SALT Cap” was scheduled to sunset at the end of 2025. During the years post the TCJA, 36 states enacted work arounds for individuals who are partners in partnerships or shareholders in S corporations. While each state’s law is different, the general approach provides a pass-through entity tax (PTET) mechanism that allowed a pass-through entity to elect to pay an entity-level state income tax and pass the resulting tax benefit along to its partners and/or shareholders. The IRS approved of the PTET SALT Cap work-around when it issued Notice 2020-75, 2020-49 I.R.B. 1453, which provided that the IRS intended to issue regulations clarifying that state income taxes paid by a pass-through entity would be allowed as a deduction by the entity. No regulations were ever issued.

The Legislation raises the SALT Cap to $40,000 for tax years beginning in 2025 and does not limit or otherwise explicitly affect the deduction for partners or shareholders of pass-through entities who avail themselves of the PTET deduction. For tax year 2026, the SALT Cap will increase to $40,400 and for years after 2026 and before 2030, the SALT Cap will be 101% of the dollar amount for the taxable year in the preceding calendar year. For years after 2029, the SALT Cap will revert to $10,000.

The SALT Cap is subject to a phase down by 30 percent of a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000 (or $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing separately) for tax year 2025. For taxable year 2026, the phase down begins at $505,000 and for years after 2026 and before 2030, the phase down begins at 101 percent of the dollar amount in effect for the taxable year of the preceding year. The SALT Cap will never go below $10,000.

Certain exclusions from gross income provided under the Code for U.S. citizens or residents living abroad, or for residents of Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands or Puerto Rico are added back to MAGI for purposes of computing the phase down.

State Income Tax Nexus Protection (Public Law 86-272)

Some were hoping that the Legislation would modernize and expand Public Law 86-272’s protections from state income taxes, which have remained unchanged since 1959. In short, Public Law 86-272 prevents states from imposing net income taxes on businesses whose only contact with the state is the solicitation of orders for tangible personal property. An increasing number of states have taken the position that Public Law 86-272 does not protect companies operating a modern website and conducting other virtual activities. Public Law 86-272 modernization protections likely were left out of the Legislation.

Qualified Small Business Stock

The Legislation amends Code section 1202 in three taxpayer beneficial ways. First, a partial exclusion from the sale of Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) now starts after a three-year holding period. Second, the amount of eligible gain that may be excluded is increased. Third, the definition of “qualified small business” is broadened to include businesses with gross assets of up to $75 million.

Code Section 1202 now provides for a partial exclusion of gain from the sale of QSBS acquired after the date of enactment and held for three and four years of 50 percent and 75 percent of eligible gain, respectively. The exclusion for eligible gain from the sale of QSBS held for five years or more continues to be 100 percent. Prior law allowed for a 100 percent exclusion of eligible gain, but only if the taxpayer held the QSBS for five years (although rollovers were permitted).

The amount of eligible gain that may be excluded is increased from $10 million to $15 million and for years after 2026, the eligible gain amount is indexed for inflation.

Under prior law, to qualify as a “qualified small business” the aggregate gross assets of the corporation could not exceed $50 million. The new law increases the amount of gross assets to $75 million, which also is indexed for inflation.

Section 199A Qualified Business Income Deduction

The Legislation makes permanent Section 199A, which provides a non-corporate taxpayer a deduction for up to 20 percent of “qualified business income,” including from passthrough entities, and certain other amounts. Prior to amendment, Section 199A was scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2025.

The Legislation makes two additional taxpayer-favorable changes:

By way of background, qualified business income includes certain income, gain, deduction and loss with respect to a “qualified trade or business,” but not a “specified service trade or business” (such as law, accounting, and consulting firms, as well as investment management and finance-related businesses). Also, the deduction cannot exceed certain thresholds based on the qualified trade or business’s W-2 wages and certain basis determinations. The specified service trade or business, W-2 wages, and basis limitations do not apply if a taxpayer’s income is below a specified income threshold adjusted annually for inflation ($197,300 for non-joint filers and $394,600 for joint filers in 2025), and they are phased-in if the taxpayer’s income is less than the sum of (i) the income threshold and (ii) $50,000 in the case of non-joint filers and $100,000 in the case of joint filers (the Phase-in Amounts). The Legislation expands the phase-in range by increasing the Phase-in Amounts from $50,000 to $75,000 for non-joint filers and from $100,000 to $150,000 for joint filers.

The Legislation provides a minimum (inflation-adjusted) $400 deduction for taxpayers having at least $1,000 of qualified business income from one or more “active qualifying trade[s] or business[es]” (generally any qualified trade or business in which the taxpayer materially participates within the meaning of Section 469(h)).

The amendments to Section 199A are effective for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Section 461(l) Limitation on Excess Business Loss

The Legislation makes permanent Section 461(l), which disallows a non-corporate taxpayer’s “excess business loss” (generally, net business loss exceeding a threshold amount adjusted for inflation; the threshold amount for 2025 is $313,000 for non-joint filers and $626,000 for joint filers). Disallowed loss generally is treated as a net operating loss and carried over to the succeeding taxable year. Prior to the Legislation, Section 461(l) was scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2028. An earlier Senate version included language, ultimately dropped, that would have treated carried forward excess business loss as excess business loss subject to the Section 461(l) limitation.

This amendment to Section 461(l) is effective for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2026.

Section 707(a)(2) Disguised Sale Rules

The Legislation amends the partnership “disguised sale” rules, apparently to clarify that they are self-executing.

By way of background, Section 707(a)(2) provides that certain transactions occurring between a partner and partnership may be recharacterized as occurring between (i) the partnership and a person who is not acting as a partner or (ii) two or more partners, none of whom is acting as a partner. The rules may apply when a partner performs services for the partnership or transfers property to the partnership and there is a related direct or indirect allocation and distribution from the partnership to the partner, and when a partner directly or indirectly transfers money or other property to the partnership and there is a related direct or indirect transfer of money or other property by the partnership to the partner. While final regulations on disguised sales of property are long-standing, Treasury and the IRS have not issued final regulations on disguised sales of partnership interests or on disguised payments for services.

Prior to amendment, Section 707(a)(2) began with the text “Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.” The Legislation modifies that text to state, “Except as provided by the Secretary,” resolving any uncertainty about whether the disguised sale rules apply in the absence of final regulations. The amendment is effective for services performed and property transferred after July 4, 2025, and states that it shall not be construed as creating any inference with respect to services performed or property transferred on or before July 4, 2025.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

The Legislation amends the 75-percent asset value test in Section 856(c)(4), which an entity must satisfy to qualify as a REIT, to increase permitted ownership of taxable REIT subsidiary stock from 20 percent to 25 percent. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Oil and Gas Intangible Drilling Costs

The Legislation allows oil and gas companies to exempt intangible drilling and development costs from their adjusted financial statement income when calculating their corporate AMT.

Exclusion from Gross Income of Interest on Loans Secured by Rural or Agricultural Real Property

The Legislation excludes from gross income 25 percent of interest income received from certain rural or agricultural real estate loans (including loans on certain farms, ranches and aquaculture facilities) made after the date of enactment of the Legislation by FDIC-insured banks and certain domestic entities owned by a bank holding company or insurance holding company, state or federally-regulated insurance companies or Farmer Mac. The Legislation includes a corresponding provision that operates to generally limit the ability of such lenders to deduct 25 percent of any interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to finance such rural or agricultural real estate loans. The exclusion from gross income (and related limitation on interest deductibility) is applicable for taxable years ending after the date of enactment of the Legislation.

Opportunity Zones

As background, the Opportunity Zone (OZ) program was created as part of the TCJA with the goal of increasing long-term investments in low-income communities. Under TCJA, the OZ program generally permits taxpayers to defer recognizing certain types of realized gains (and in some cases to permanently exclude from gross income a portion thereof) if they invest the amount of their gain into a qualified opportunity fund (QOF) within a 180-day period. The Legislation provides for the (OZ) program to become a permanent fixture of the Code.

New Opportunity Zone Designations

Beginning Jan. 1, 2027, there will be rolling 10-year OZ designations (i.e., every 10 years census tracts will be reviewed to determine if they still qualify for OZ designation, and the State governors will have the opportunity to re-designate OZs in their states based on the updated census tract information). The Legislation also narrows the eligibility criteria for designation as an OZ, including eliminating the ability to designate census tracts as OZs that by themselves do not qualify but that are “contiguous” to qualifying census tracts.

Modification of Current OZ Benefits

Under the current OZ program, if a taxpayer holds an investment in a QOF for at least five years, the taxpayer receives a basis step-up equal to 10 percent of the deferred gain (i.e., effectively providing the taxpayer with a permanent gain exclusion equal to 10 percent). If the investment is held for at least seven years, an additional 5 percent basis step-up is provided. The Legislation retains the ability of a taxpayer who makes an investment into a QOF after Dec. 31, 2026, to permanently exclude 10 percent of the deferred gain if the taxpayer holds his QOF investment for at least five years. The additional 5 percent basis step-up/ permanent exclusion for a seven-year hold included in the TCJA is not available for investments made after 2026.

Also under the current OZ program, if a taxpayer holds an investment in a QOF for at least 10 years, the taxpayer gets a basis step-up to fair market value (FMV) on the date the investment is sold or exchanged (i.e., effectively providing the taxpayer with full tax-free appreciation on the investment). The Legislation modifies this benefit for taxpayers that hold on to their QOF investments for more than 30 years by limiting their basis step-up to the FMV of their investment on that 30-year anniversary date.

The new “income recognition” date for investments made in QOFs after Dec. 31, 2026, is the earlier of (i) the date the investment is sold or exchanged, or (ii) the date that is five years after the investment in the QOF. Thus, unlike in the current statutory scheme where the “income recognition date” is a set Dec. 31, 2026 (unless the investment is sold earlier), every taxpayer investing in a QOF after 2026 will be able to defer its gain for a set five years as long as such investment is held for such 5-year period.

New Benefits for Investments in Rural Area OZs

If an investor holds an interest in a QOF that invests, directly or indirectly, in a sufficient amount of tangible property used in a “rural” OZ, the 10 percent exclusion attributable to a five-year holding period is increased to 30 percent. Additionally, the “substantial improvement” requirement for qualifying OZ property is relaxed for property located in a rural OZ.

New Reporting

The Legislation creates new annual reporting requirements for QOFs and qualifying entities in which QOFs invest (i.e., qualified opportunity zone businesses, or QOZBs) and institutes penalties for late filing. Among other items, information on the number of residential units held by, and full-time employees of, the QOF and/or QOZB will now be required to be reported annually. The Legislation also requires the Treasury to prepare publicly available reports summarizing information related to, among other things, the number and dollar value of investments in QOFs and the impact of such investments on the designated OZs.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

The Legislation makes the following changes to the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) under Section 42 of the Code:

State Housing Credit Ceiling Increase

The Legislation includes a permanent 12 percent increase to the annual 9 percent LIHTC allocation.

Expansion of Tax-Exempt Bond Financing Provision

Under the current LIHTC rules, if 50 percent or more of the aggregate basis of a building and land is financed with tax-exempt bonds that are subject to the state’s volume cap, that entire building would be eligible for 4 percent credits without an allocation from the state (as opposed to just the portion of the building financed with the bonds). The Legislation generally expands that favorable rule to buildings, at least 25 percent of the aggregate basis of which are financed with tax-exempt bonds.

New Markets Tax Credit

The New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program was created as part of the Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000, with the goal of encouraging investment in low-income communities (LICs). The program operates by having certified community development entities (CDEs) apply to the CDFI Fund for a NMTC allocation, which CDEs can then “award” to projects operating in LICs, generally based on each CDE’s chosen “economic development” criteria. An investor will thereafter make an equity investment into an affiliate of the CDE (the Sub-CDE), which will be combined with other project funds in order to arrive at the amount of the NMTC allocation awarded to the project. These combined proceeds will then be used by the Sub-CDE to make loans, with favorable terms, to the project entity. The result of this structure is an aggregate NMTC equal to 39 percent X the NMTC allocation, which is available to the investor over a seven-year period.

For each of the years 2024 and 2025, the total amount of NMTC allocations available to be awarded to CDEs is $5 billion. Awards for this $10 billion “double round” are expected to be announced in the fall of 2025. The program has never been permanent, but has always been extended in annual increments prior to any expiration date, with the most recent five-year extension coming in 2020. Without a legislative extension, the awards to be announced this fall would have been the final round and the NMTC program would have expired at the end of 2025.

The Legislation provides for a permanent extension of the NMTC program with $5 billion of allocations available to be awarded to CDEs on an annual basis beginning in 2026.

Information Reporting and Form 1099K – Repeal of Revision to De Minimis Rules for Third-Party Network Transactions

Under current law, third-party settlement organizations (TPSOs), such as online marketplaces, are required to report certain payment transactions for goods and services that exceed a minimum threshold of $600 to the IRS and to the sellers using their platforms (“participating payees”) on Form 1099-K. A TPSO is the central organization that provides a third-party payment network and has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) lowered the threshold for Form 1099-K reporting applicable to third-party payment network transactions to $600, effective for calendar year 2022. However, the IRS has repeatedly delayed full implementation of the $600 threshold. Prior to the change, a de minimisexception only required reporting if the gross amount of the payment transactions with respect to a participating payee for the year exceeded $20,000 and the aggregate number of such transactions exceeded 200. Due to the delays in implementing the change in reporting thresholds, for calendar year 2024, TPSOs were required to file a Form 1099-K for participating payees receiving gross payments exceeding $5,000, regardless of the number of transactions. This threshold decreased to $2,500 for calendar year 2025 and then to $600, as originally mandated by the ARPA, for calendar years after 2025.

The Legislation reverts to the previous de minimisreporting exception for TPSOs so that a TPSO would not be required to report with respect to payment transactions of its participating payees unless the gross amount of the transactions exceeds $20,000 and the aggregate number of such transactions exceeds 200. The reinstatement of the de minimisexception applies as if included in the ARPA and thus applies to returns for calendar years beginning after Dec. 31, 2021.

Increase in Threshold for Requiring Information Reporting with Respect to Certain Payees

The Legislation increases the information reporting threshold for certain payments made by persons engaged in a trade or business to another person (Code Section 6041(a)) and payments of remuneration for services (Code Section 6041A(a)) from $600 to $2,000 in a calendar year. The threshold amount would be adjusted for inflation in calendar years after 2026. No change is made to the information reporting threshold for direct sales (Code Section 6041A(b)). The increase in the information reporting threshold applies with respect to payments made after Dec. 31, 2025.

Employee Retention Tax Credit Provisions

The CARES Act created the Employee Retention Tax Credit (“ERTC”) in March of 2021. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 also included ERTC provisions. The ERTC provided a refundable tax credit for portions of payroll taxes that were paid during the COVID-19 crisis. The Legislation changes several provisions regarding the administration and enforcement of the ERTC as follows:

Statute of Limitations:

The Legislation disallows ERTC refund claims for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 filed after Jan. 31, 2024. The statute of limitations on assessments for those claims is extended to six years from several possible starting dates. Before passage of the Legislation, taxpayers had until April 15, 2024, to claim the ERTC for any applicable payroll taxes in 2020 and until April 15, 2025, for any applicable payroll taxes in 2021. The House version would have disallowed ERTC claims for all quarters filed after Jan. 31, 2024, but the Byrd rule prevents changes affecting Social Security from inclusion in reconciliation legislation. For the third and fourth quarters of 2021, ERTC claims were against Medicare taxes.

Enforcement Provisions Against Promoters:

The Legislation imposes penalties and reporting requirements on “COVID-ERTC Promoters.” A COVID-ERTC Promoter is any person providing “aid, assistance, or advice” to taxpayers in filing an ERTC claim and deriving a significant portion of their revenue from such assistance. Certified PEOs are explicitly excluded from qualifying as a COVID-ERTC Promoter. The Legislation requires COVID-ERTC Promoters to comply with certain due diligence requirements with respect to a taxpayer’s eligibility for the ERTC and imposes a $1,000 penalty for each failure to comply with such due diligence requirements.

Individual Tax Changes

With respect to individual taxes, the Legislation, among other items:

Makes TCJA individual tax rates and the standard deduction permanent, with some helpful adjustments; specifically, it permanently extends and increases individual tax bracket values and provides an additional year of inflation indexing

Makes the TCJA standard deduction increases permanent, retroactive to include tax year 2025;

Continues elimination of personal exemptions by permanently setting the deduction amount to zero, except provides a temporary $6,000 deduction for seniors (discussed immediately below);

Adds a temporary deduction of $6,000 under Section 151 (personal exemptions) for seniors for tax years 2025 through 2028 for those earning $75,000 or less ($150,000 for joint filers) with a phase-out for excess earnings up to $175,000 ($250,000 joint filers) to help offset taxation of Social Security income;

Permanently repeals miscellaneous itemized deductions (but restores deductions of unreimbursed educator expenses for teachers);

Caps the value of itemized deductions at 35 percent and places a floor of .5% on itemized deductions of charitable contributions;

Allows charitable contribution deduction for individuals who do not itemize deductions ($1,000 for single filers; $2,000 for joint filers);

Makes permanent the Section 199A deduction at 20 percent with modest beneficial changes (discussed above in greater detail);

Permanently increases the child tax credit by $200 to $2,200, effective for 2025 and indexes for inflation (also makes permanent the $1400 refundable child credit, indexed for inflation); subject to income phase-outs at $200,000 ($400,000 for joint filers); both taxpayers and dependents must have Social Security numbers in order to claim;

Makes permanent the $500 nonrefundable credit for dependents other than a qualifying child;

Establishes Trump investment accounts for children, which are eligible to receive contributions of up to $5,000 annually and also would receive $1,000 from the federal government for children born from 2025 through 2028 (more detail below);

Eliminates tax on tips for tax years 2025-2028, capped at a $25,000 federal income tax deduction, with phase-outs for those earning more than $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers);

Eliminates tax on overtime for tax years 2025-2028, generally limited to a federal income tax deduction of $12,500 ($25,000 for joint filers), with phase-outs for those earning more than $150,000 ($300,000 for joint filers);

Allow a deduction for certain new car loan interest (only if the vehicle’s final assembly occurs in the U.S.) of up to $10,000 for tax years 2025 through 2028 for those earning $100,000 or less ($200,000 for joint filers), with a phase-down thereafter;

Makes TCJA’s increased alternative minimum tax exemptions permanent at 2018 exemption phaseout levels of $500,000 ($1 million for joint filers) and indexes for inflation. Increases phaseout of the exemption amount to 50 percent (from 25 percent) of the amount by which a taxpayers AMT income exceeds the threshold amount;

Makes permanent TCJA limits regarding deductions of mortgage interest ($750,000 of acquisition indebtedness and no deductions relating to home equity lines); adds provision treating certain mortgage insurance premiums on acquisition indebtedness as qualified residence interest.

Extends and modifies limitations on wagering losses, limits the definition of annual wagering losses to 90 percent of actual losses and then allows deductions of those losses only to the extent of total annual wagering gains;

Eliminates Section 217 moving expense deduction except for members of the armed forces and certain members of the intelligence community;

Makes permanent and modifies (to include state-declared disasters) limitations regarding personal casualty losses (generally requiring itemization to claim and subject to floor of 10 percent of AGI).

Trump Accounts

The Legislation establishes a new type of custodial account for minors. Trump accounts would be a form of Individual Retirement Account (but not a Roth IRA) and would generally be treated in the same manner as an IRA. Key features include:

Eligibility and Characteristics: To be eligible for a Trump account, the account beneficiary must be below the age of 18 before the close of the calendar year in which the account is established and have a Social Security number. Trump account funds can grow tax-free until they are withdrawn but must be invested in mutual funds or ETFs that track the returns of a qualified index (such as the S&P 500 or other index funds that are primarily comprised of U.S. companies), do not use leverage, do not have annual fees and expenses of more than .1 percent of the balance of the fund investment and meet other criteria Treasury determines appropriate. Under the Legislation, Treasury could set up Trump accounts for individuals whom it identifies as eligible and for which no Trump account has already been established.

Contributions: The contribution limit for a taxable year is $5,000 (other than qualified rollover contributions) and is adjusted for inflation for taxable years after 2027. Contributions can only be made in calendar years before the beneficiary turns 18 and will not be accepted until 12 months after the date of enactment of the Legislation. U.S. federal, state, local, and tribal governments as well as charitable organizations could make “general funding contributions,” which would be contributions made to a specified qualified class of Trump account beneficiaries, and these contributions would not be subject to the $5,000 limit. No deduction is allowed for any contributions to a Trump account made before the first day of the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 18.

Employer Contributions: Employers may contribute up to $2,500 (adjusted for inflation for taxable years after 2027) to the Trump account of an employee or the employee’s dependent without it being taxable to the employee.

Distributions: No distributions are permitted before the first day of the calendar year in which the beneficiary turns 18 (other than distributions of qualified rollover contributions). The rules applicable to distributions from IRAs generally apply.

Pilot Program: Under a pilot program, Treasury will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 to the Trump account of each qualifying child born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, and who is a U.S. citizen and has a Social Security number.

Estate and Gift Tax Exemption Changes

Currently, the federal estate and gift tax exemption is an inflation-adjusted amount of $13.99 million per individual for 2025, though under prior law that amount was set to drop to an estimated inflation-adjusted amount of $7.14 million for tax year 2026. The Legislation permanently increases the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million per individual for tax years 2026 and beyond. The $15 million exemption amount is indexed for inflation, meaning for tax years after 2026 the $15 million exemption amount will be increased based on inflation adjustments. The federal generation-skipping transfer tax exemption is permanently increased by the Legislation to an inflation-indexed amount of $15 million.

Premium Tax Credit Limitations

The Premium Tax Credit, which helps lower-income individuals afford health insurance through the federal exchange, would be restricted by the Legislation to a narrower group of lawfully present noncitizens. Eligible individuals must either be lawful permanent residents, Cuban nationals with approved petitions awaiting visa availability or individuals lawfully residing under a Compact of Free Association.

Excluded from eligibility would be asylum seekers, parolees, Temporary Protected Status recipients, individuals granted deferred action or enforced departure, and those granted withholding of removal. These individuals, though lawfully present, would no longer qualify for the credit. Additionally, the Legislation proposes to repeal the provision that allowed noncitizens with incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty level to access the credit if they were ineligible for Medicaid due to immigration status. It also updates Affordable Care Act provisions to align with these new restrictions, including related subsidies and health program access.

New Excise Tax on Remittance Transfers

A new 1 percent excise tax would apply to certain international remittance transfers from the U.S. Such transfers would not include certain small-value transactions. If the excise tax is not paid by the sender, the provider would be required to collect and remit it. The Legislation provides two exceptions for U.S. citizens and nationals. Taxpayers may use a qualified provider that verifies citizenship (for example, by withdrawing funds from a bank account or charging the remittance to a credit or debit card) and also may claim a refundable tax credit by providing a Social Security number and proof of payment. Providers are required to report detailed remittance data, including sender information, amounts transferred, and taxes collected for credit-eligible individuals.

Social Security Number Requirement for Education Credits

The Legislation tightens requirements for claiming the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning education credits. A valid Social Security Number would be required for the taxpayer, spouse (if applicable) and any student for whom education expenses are claimed, replacing the more flexible taxpayer identification number requirement.

Exempt Organization Changes

Increased University Endowment Tax (Section 4968)

The Legislation increases the tax on college and university net investment income from 1.4 percent to 8 percent for institutions with a “student adjusted endowment” above $2 million. Schools with student adjusted endowments of between $750,000 and $2 million per student will see their net investment income tax increase from 1.4 percent to 4 percent. The Legislation also expands which institutions are subject to the tax, but it excludes smaller schools with fewer than 3,000 tuition-paying students. Assets and net investment income of related organizations are generally included in the income calculation, as are student loan interest and royalty income. The changes are estimated to cost universities $761 million over 10 years.

Significant Tax Increases: Institutions with large endowments per student face dramatic increases in excise tax liability.

Broader Scope: Many institutions previously not subject to the tax may become subject to it due to the expanded definitions and inclusion of student loan interest and royalty income from intellectual property developed by students and faculty members using federal funding, as well as related organizations’ assets and income.

New Compliance Burdens: Enhanced reporting and anti-avoidance rules will require careful review of endowment investments, royalty structures, and related entities.

Immediate Planning: Institutions should begin modeling the impact of these changes and consider how their endowment management, investment strategies and organizational structures may be affected and optimized.

Expansion of the Tax on Excess Compensation (Section 4960)

The Legislation expands the application of the tax paid by tax-exempt organizations on compensation over $1 million and certain severance payments. The definition of “covered employee” is broadened to include any employee (including any former employees employed on or after Jan. 1, 2017) of an applicable tax-exempt organization or any predecessor of such organization—not just the “high five” compensated individuals to which this section currently applies. This expansion significantly increases the number of individuals who will trigger the tax. The change is expected to cost tax-exempt organizations more than $3.8 billion over 10 years.

Modification to Charitable Contribution Deduction

The Legislation reinstates a partial charitable contribution deduction for individuals who do not itemize deductions ($1,000 for single filers; $2,000 for joint filers), at a cost to the federal government of $73.8 billion over 10 years. This cost is offset by a 0.5 percent floor on the deduction of contributions for those who do itemize, which is estimated to raise $63 billion. A similar 1 percent floor on corporate charitable deductions is estimated to raise $16.6 billion.

All of these provisions apply to taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Employer-Provided Benefits

The Legislation includes a handful of provisions that affect benefits provided by employers as well as provisions related to compensation paid to certain employees.

Health Savings Account Changes

Current health savings account (HSA) rules disqualify individuals from making contributions to an HSA under certain circumstances, and the Legislation liberalizes a few of these rules.

Telehealth

A COVID-era exemption previously allowed individuals to receive telehealth services without applying a deductible and maintain eligibility to make HSA contributions. The Legislation retroactively reinstates the exemption to when the original exemption expired and makes the exemption permanent.

Direct Primary Care Service Arrangements

The Legislation also allows an individual to remain eligible to make HSA contributions if the individual participates in a “direct primary care service arrangement,” which generally means an arrangement whereby the individual receives primary care services from primary care providers in exchange for a fixed fee. This eligibility rule does not apply if the fixed fee exceeds $150 per month ($300 per month if the arrangement applies to multiple individuals), and such amounts will be adjusted annually. In addition, direct primary care service arrangement fees are treated as medical expenses that can be paid using an HSA.

These direct primary care services arrangement changes apply to months beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Educational Assistance

Code Section 127 allows employers to offer certain amounts of educational assistance tax-free to employees. The definition of “educational assistance” was previously expanded to include assistance related to an employee’s student loans. The Legislation makes this expansion, which was set to expire at the end of 2025, permanent. The Legislation also adds language providing for an inflation adjustment with respect to the maximum tax exclusion (currently $5,250) for education assistance furnished in a calendar year.

Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account Contribution Increased to $7,500 ($3,750 for Married Individuals Filing Separately)

Employers may offer employees dependent care flexible spending accounts (DCFSAs), which generally allow employees to contribute wages to a DCFSA pre-tax and then use the DCFSA to reimburse, on a tax-free basis, dependent care expenses incurred by the employee. For many years, the maximum DCFSA contribution amount has been $5,000 ($2,500 for married individuals filing separately). The Legislation increases those amounts to $7,500 and $3,750, respectively, for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Commuter Benefit Programs

The ability to offer tax-free reimbursement for bicycle commuting expenses, sometimes called a “transportation fringe,” has been permanently eliminated under the Legislation.

Executive Compensation in Excess of $1 Million

Currently, public companies cannot deduct more than $1 million with respect to compensation for a small number of top employees (technically called “covered employees”). For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, the Legislation modifies the rule to apply it to “specified covered employees” in the public company’s controlled group. Specifically, (i) a specified covered employee’s compensation from all controlled group members will be considered; and (ii) in determining who the specified covered employees are, identifying the five highest-paid employees would be determined by analyzing the entire controlled group’s employee population. Other than the criteria above, specified covered employees will be determined by the other three existing criteria used for identifying “covered employees,” which would still apply based solely on the public company’s employee population.

The Code contains a corollary provision for nonexempt organizations in the form of an excise tax on compensation exceeding $1 million, which the Legislation modifies. This modification is addressed above, in the “Exempt Organization Proposed Changes”section.

Deduction for Employer-Provided Meals

Effective for amounts paid or incurred after Dec. 31, 2025, the TCJA added a prohibition on deductions for certain expenses related to (1) meals provided to employees and their spouses and dependents by the employer on its premises, and (2) an employer’s operation of an eating facility for employees (including food and beverage costs). The Legislation retains this deduction prohibition but adds a small carve-out. Specifically, the deduction prohibition will not apply if the expenses relate to (i) a good or service for which the employer receives adequate consideration in a bona fide transaction, or (ii) food or beverages provided on or at certain commercial vessels, oil or gas platforms, and fishing vessels or fish processing facilities.

Miscellaneous Items

Qualified Sound Recording Productions Eligible for Expensing and Bonus Depreciation

The Legislation adds a new category, “qualified sound recording productions” to the special expensing rules that already apply to qualified film, television and live theatrical productions under Section 181 of the Code. A qualified sound recording production is a sound recording (as defined under U.S. copyright law) produced and recorded in the U.S. Sound recording production costs of up to $150,000, in total, in the taxable year would be allowed as a deduction. However, as with qualified film, television and live theatrical productions, the Section 181 deduction only applies to qualified sound recording productions that commence before Jan. 1, 2026. Consequently, the Section 181 deduction will be of limited benefit since only sound recording productions commencing in taxable years ending after the date of enactment of the Legislation and before Jan. 1, 2026, will be eligible for the Section 181 deduction.

The Legislation also makes qualified sound recording productions placed in service in a taxable year eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) of the Code. A qualified sound recording production will be considered placed in service at the time of initial release or broadcast. The bonus depreciation amendments apply to qualified sound recording productions commencing in taxable years ending after the date of enactment of the Legislation.

Reduction of Excise Tax on the Transfer or Manufacture of Certain Firearms

The National Firearms Act, codified in Chapter 53 of the Code, generally imposes a $200 excise tax on each transfer or manufacture of a firearm (the excise tax is $5 for weapons capable of being concealed). The Legislation eliminates the transfer tax and manufacture tax on most firearms (excise tax is reduced to zero) and imposes a $200 transfer tax and manufacture tax only on machine guns and destructive devices. The reduction in excise tax is effective for calendar quarters beginning more than 90 days after the date of enactment of the Legislation.

Reduction in CFPB’s Mandatory Funding Structure, and Similar Items

The Legislation reduces the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB or Bureau) mandatory funding structure. Established by Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act (PL 111-203), the CFPB’s funding does not come from Congress through the annual appropriations process. Rather the Bureau’s funding comes from the Federal Reserve’s operations. The Dodd-Frank Act provided that the CFPB requests funds directly from the Federal Reserve, up to a statutory limit. However, the Dodd-Frank Act did not establish a minimum CFPB funding level. The Legislation reduces the maximum limit from 12 percent to 6.5 percent but does not alter the CFPB’s statutory functions and duties, including the semi-annual testimony by the CFPB Director to Congress. The Legislation also eliminates the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Reserve Fund, established by Title IX, Section 991, of the Dodd-Frank Act. The SEC had used the Fund for technology investments. On Oct. 1, 2025, the Legislation requires the SEC to transfer both the obligated and unobligated balance in the Reserve Fund to the Treasury Department and closes the Fund. Finally, the Legislation rescinds the unobligated funds of the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Green and Resilient Retrofit Program established by the Inflation Reduction Act. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) noted that the Legislation will “deliver on President Trump’s mandate to cut waste and duplication in our federal government and save hardworking taxpayer dollars” and House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR) stated, “I am proud of the House Financial Services Committee's contributions to the meaningful spending reductions in this bill.”

Conclusion

With this first Trump Administration budget reconciliation bill enacted, taxpayers should determine the expected impacts on their business plans, transaction pipelines, anticipated restructurings, operational affairs and estate plans and consider adjustments as appropriate.

Some of the proposed changes and spending cuts that were dropped solely because the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that inclusion would have violated the “Byrd Rule” that governs the reconciliation process may be revisited during the FY 2026 appropriations process and through standalone legislation during the remainder of the 119th Congress. With respect to provisions included in the Legislation, taxpayers should turn their focus toward offering input as the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service develop and issue implementing regulations and related guidance.

There is likely to be one or more additional reconciliation bills during late 2025 and 2026 and therefore additional opportunities for enactment of additional provisions, as well as changes and improvements to the Legislation.

Soybean oil futures were up the limit and soybean futures jumped more than 25 cents.
If finalized, the rule removes one element of uncertainty clouding soybean oil and soybean demand.","The use of soybean oil to produce renewable diesel is critical to soybean demand and its potential growth. Soybean oil usage for biofuel production is projected at 13.9 billion pounds in marketing year 2025/26 (Sept. 1, 2025-Aug. 30, 2026) and accounts for approximately 45% of soybean oil usage in the U.S. Left to the private market, there would be no demand for renewable diesel because of its cost compared to conventional diesel. However, the renewable volume obligations (RVOs) set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the renewable fuel standard (RFS) help overcome the cost difference by mandating biomass diesel fuel usage. Low carbon fuel standards (LCFS) adopted by California, Oregon, and Washington have also boosted demand.

Because demand for renewable diesel is driven by government policy it is effectively capped at the mandated amount. Scott Irwin, an agricultural economist at the University of Illinois, last year pegged the cap at 4.0-4.5 billion gallons, yet production capacity has been estimated around 7.0 billion gallons. Thus, soybean growers, processors, and biofuel advocates have been lobbying the EPA to increase the RVOs when setting the mandates under the RFS for 2026 and 2027. The industry sought an RVO of 5.25 billion gallons and has lobbied to restrict imports of renewable diesel or foreign feedstocks, like used cooking oil from China, to protect domestic sources.

Thus, it was a pleasant day for the sector when on June 13 the EPA announced a proposed rule to raise the RVOs for biomass-based diesel (biodiesel and renewable diesel) to 5.61 billion RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers) for 2026 and 5.86 billion for 2027, levels exceeding what the industry was seeking (Figure 1). According to Faith Parum, an economist for American Farm Bureau, RINs are credits based on the production of biofuels. Each gallon of renewable fuel produced is assigned a RIN. Aaron Smith, an economist at the University of California-Berkley, says that depending on the level of imports, the new rule will require the usage of between 4.45-5.7 billion gallons next year. Smith also noted the new rule specifies that imported fuel and fuel made domestically with imported feedstocks can earn only half the credits of domestically-produced fuel, giving a leg-up to domestic fuels and feedstocks. The EPA says the proposed rule sets the highest volume requirements ever under the RFS.

Their NextCycle Michigan pitch sought funding for a Food Waste Diversion Director position and to train and deploy three more food waste team members.","As the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) pursues the state’s bold goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and a 45% recycling rate by 2030, food waste reduction and composting have emerged as key strategies where these goals can be addressed simultaneously. Specifically, the Michigan Healthy Climate Plan calls for cutting food waste by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030.

In a Planet Detroit article, Julie Staveland, assistant division director for EGLE’s Materials Management Division said, “EGLE is investing in this issue because reducing food waste is one of the lowest-hanging fruit we can address to help us reach our climate goals, as identified in the MI Healthy Climate Plan.”

NextCycle Michigan is one of the primary programs EGLE is using to address food waste management. The NextCycle Michigan Accelerator program advances on-the-ground projects that will reduce waste or increase reuse, recycling, or composting in Michigan.

In just the first four years of the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator, nearly two dozen teams took advantage of the program to take their food-recovery-related projects to the next level. This article highlights six teams and one NextCycle Michigan network partner.

Redirecting surplus food

Both the U.S. EPA and Michigan EGLE have published guidance on sustainable food waste management activities ranking food waste prevention and food surplus donation and upcycling as preferred strategies to reduce environmental impacts. NextCycle Michigan alum team Metro Food Rescue and network partner Make Food Not Waste operate, and cooperate, in this space.

Metro Food Rescue is a food rescue organization in metro Detroit serving as a link between businesses with food to donate—bakeries, manufacturers, farmers, caterers, event centers, and the like—and pantries and soup kitchens which provide food to people in need. In 2023 they provided nearly two million meals to their neighbors while simultaneously cutting greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 4,000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E). Working with mentors and consultants provided by NextCycle Michigan, Metro Food Rescue explored revenue models and built partnerships with more food generators and pantries. They are on track to grow their impact to 15 million meals per year by 2027.

Make Food Not Waste (MFNW), a NextCycle Michigan Partner, is one of the organizations that receives donated food from Metro Food Rescue. They use the food at their Upcycling Kitchens—located at a Presbyterian church and a Salvation Army center that provides services for those suffering from addiction—to create delicious, nutritious, and complete meals for the community.

Danielle Todd, executive director of MFNW said, “Metro Food Rescue is one of our favorite partners and one that we recommend all of the time to potential food donors. We know we can count on them to respond right away and to make the rescue work not only for food donors but also for people like us who rely on regular food donations to serve the community.”

Food waste composting in cities and townships

Ferndale (Oakland County)

The City of Ferndale, in Oakland County, managed a popular pilot food-waste drop-off composting program serving both residential and commercial customers with support from the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator program. With NextCycle’s mentors and consultants, they estimated food waste production and recovery potential, analyzed growth options, researched composting technologies, projected costs, identified grantors, and honed their pitch for further funding.

Building on the success of the pilot, they joined the a second NextCycle Michigan cohort to get help in developing a composting system within the city to process the collected organics.

Claire Dion, former Zero Waste Program Coordinator at the City of Ferndale said of the benefits of the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator, “Having our pitch deck and having completed all of the data collection we were able to do, it really is going to set us up for success in applying for grant opportunities.”

Beaver Island – Saint James & Peaine Townships (Charlevoix County)

Saint James and Peaine townships located in Charlevoix County—which, together, encompass Lake Michigan’s Beaver Island—are also worked with NextCycle Michigan to create a composting system for their residents, visitors, and businesses. Beaver Island is the most remote inhabited island in the Great Lakes. It has a year-round population of roughly 600 residents and a summer peak of a few thousand people. There is no regular curbside collection of garbage or recyclables; island residents and businesses must drop it all off at a transfer station and recycling center (TSRC) jointly run by the two townships.

Their location 40 miles from the mainland’s barge dock makes managing materials expensive for the islanders. The island’s property owners pay for waste and recycling services in three ways:

Fees charged when they drop off waste or bulky items at the TSRC,

Townships property taxes allocated to support and run the TSRC, and

Charlevoix County’s recycling millage.

All the island’s recyclable materials and garbage are shipped by barge to the mainland, then a contracted waste hauler moves the waste to a landfill and processes and markets the recyclables. The TSRC pays for the shipping and management of the trash while the county recycling millage pays for the recyclables.

In two preliminary rounds of technical support -- one under an EGLE MICROS grant and another under a federal Economic Development Administration (EDA) Build-to-Scale grant sponsored by NextCycle Michigan and facilitated by the Centrepolis Accelerator at Lawrence Technological University—existing waste and recycling practices were analyzed and opportunities identified for improvements. They found that food-waste composting offered a win-win-win opportunity to

Save money by decreasing the amount of waste hauled off-island,

Reduce the climate impact of managing their organic waste, and

Improve the island’s sandy soil while reducing the amount of compost shipped to the island.

A NextCycle Michigan team from the island then took part in the another Accelerator cohort, working with their NextCycle Michigan coaches and subject matter experts to determine the best composting system for their unique island. They decided on a home-composting model with an estimated implementation cost of $56,000. Municipal food-waste drop-off alternatives they considered came with equipment, facilities, and site costs between $147,100 and $347,100 and annual operating expenses of $40,000 a year or more. Questions about the availability of workers to run and maintain such a composting site on a part-time basis and markets for the finished compost also weighed against these options.

The islanders’ home composting plan puts education out front, beginning in the summer of 2024, followed by implementation of a pilot program with 50 households in Summer/Fall 2024. The 50 pilot households would include 20 renters and 30 owner-occupied units. Each pilot household would receive a 0.75-gallon caddy for collecting compostables in the kitchen, a 65-gallon composting bin for outdoors, and further education. After evaluating the opportunities and challenges identified through the pilot, a full roll out to the remaining 218 occupied households is anticipated in Winter/Spring 2025. The team calculated the potential diversion from disposal of 110 tons a year.

Collaboration for compost benefits

Detroiter Renee V. Wallace, a longtime process and change consultant serving a variety of businesses and nonprofits, has been following a calling to grow food-scraps composting systems for the benefit of the city for over 15 years. In 2021 she received the prestigious H. Clark Gregory Award from the U.S. Composting Council for outstanding service to the composting industry through grassroots efforts.

Wallace brought together multiple partners to develop a sustainable, equitable system to compost food waste from Wayne State University (WSU) and improve composting at the Georgia Street Community Garden (GSCC). This initiative was assisted by the NextCycle Michigan Accelerator. Renee, along with Mark Covington, president and co-director of GSCC, and the WSU Office of Campus Sustainability (OCS) worked together to get the system up and running.

“We built a program in such a way that it was about integrating two communities, a city, and a campus community,” said Wallace.

Students taking part in the OCS’s Green Warriors program educated WSU students and staff about composting and collecting the compostables from dining halls and other participating campus locations.

Leaders at WSU’s Dining Services Department developed efficient systems to collect pre-consumer food scraps for composting.

The WSU Grounds Services department hauls leaves to GSCC to be blended with the food scraps.

Covington and his GSCC team manage the composting process.

Both GSCC and Wayne State use the finished compost.

Through her consulting service, Doer’s Edge, Wallace also supports NextCycle Michigan’s team recruitment and programming.

Autonomous food waste collection

Scrap Soils is a nonprofit organization offering food waste collection service to households and restaurants in City Council districts 4, 5 and 6 of Detroit. They compost this food waste at hyper-local farm partner locations. Scrap Soils and Orange Sparkle Ball (OSB) developed a pilot project using Ottonomy robots to collect food scraps in the Corktown neighborhood.

Explains Ricky Blanding, founder and CEO of Scrap Soils, “Scrap Soils and OSB had a growing partnership in terms of advisory support and goals for the community. OSB was working on autonomous mobility, and together, we conceptualized their first pilot: using robots to pick up food scraps as part of Scrap Soil’s collection service. We continued together, developing the formation of the project, along with the pilot design and funding strategy.”

The four-week pilot, launched in mid-June 2024. It was funded by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) and ran in the City of Detroit’s Transportation Innovation Zone. The robots delivered the food scraps to Brother Nature Produce’s urban farm where the Scrap Soils team composted them.

Looking back on their NextCycle Michigan Accelerator experience, executive director Ricky Blanding appreciated that Scrap Soils was chosen to take part based on prioritizing equitable access and the team’s demographic appeal to the people in the neighborhoods they serve, despite the organization having limited infrastructure. Once the Accelerator was underway, the regular meetings with their mentors helped clarify the strengths each Scrap Soils team member brought to the table. Knowing this helps Blanding to more accurately delegate to everyone on the team. They also gained experience using project management platforms like Airtable which have proven valuable in extending their workflows.

Orange Sparkle Ball was one of the teams that pitched at the NextCycle Michigan 2025 Summer Showcase in June. Its pitch was about “Penny Pickup”, the app that manages the autonomous robots that pickup and deliver the “waste” materials for reuse/recycling/composting. While it did not win one of the judge’s or people’s choice awards, it did receive a $5,000 Harvest Grant from EGLE.

Education is essential

SEEDS Ecology and Education Centers is a nonprofit established in 1999 to implement environmental solutions locally using intersecting expertise in ecology, education, and design. In 2018 SEEDS convened the Northwest Michigan Organic Waste Diversion Advisory Partners (NWMI OWDA). As EGLE began directing Renew Michigan funds toward this arena, implementing NextCycle Michigan, and requiring counties to prepare Sustainable Materials Management Plans—which must address organic wastes—SEEDS has leapt at every opportunity.

In 2021 they commissioned a market assessment covering 10 counties from Missaukee County north to Emmet County and west to Lake Michigan. The report was funded by Rotary Charities of Traverse City and EGLE’s Recycling Market Development grant program. At the same time, SEEDS took part in a NextCycle Accelerator cohort to further develop their community-scale food-waste drop-off model and prepare to access funding to expand capacity across the region to collect, haul and process organics.

The 134-page market assessment report was released early 2022 and provides all stakeholders with a rich understanding of food scraps, yard waste and woody debris generated in the region; existing diversion efforts and infrastructure from food rescue to composting; the ecosystem of stakeholders; and value-added marketable opportunities.

Next steps identified for the six core NOMI OWDA partners are well underway. Their goal for the region of cutting food waste by 30% by 2030 parallels EGLE’s goal of reducing wasted food by 50% by 2030. SEEDS is continuing with their convening and educational roles, for example by developing a demonstration and training center. Their NextCycle Michigan pitch sought funding for a Food Waste Diversion Director position and to train and deploy three more food waste team members. At the recent 2025 Summer Showcase, they pitched the process of connecting supply and demand for food and wood rescue, compost, and biochars across northwest lower Michigan. While it did not win an award, it did receive a $5,000 Harvest Grant from EGLE.

Large scale composting

NextCycle Michigan Partner Denali is an organics management company with over two dozen locations across the United States. Denali has been active in Michigan producing and selling compost and mulch in partnership with the city of Grand Rapids since 2020 and at the City of Ann Arbor compost facility since 2011.

Denali’s Ann Arbor operation grew with the city program when Ann Arbor began offering food-scraps collection in 2014. Today the city offers single-family residential properties a free 64- or 96-gallon compost cart for yard and food wastes, while commercial entities can subscribe for food-waste collection with fees based on the number of carts and frequency of pick up. As of 2020 17% of total waste generated in Ann Arbor—roughly 12,000 tons—was diverted through composting.

Filling the gaps

NextCycle Michigan Accelerator teams and network partners are making inspiring progress toward meeting the need to recover good food and make the most of unusable food. But this is just the beginning: there is vast opportunity to collect, redirect, and process food scraps in Michigan.

The Michigan Food Waste Roadmap released in March 2024 by the Michigan Sustainable Business Forum reported that to reach the State’s goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2030, “...the amount of donated food in the charitable food system must double, while not distracting from efforts to address root causes of food insecurity.” The roadmap also found that “…substantially more surplus food is managed through Michigan charities than through its commercial compost facilities.” Similarly, the 2023 NextCycle Michigan Gap Analysis indicates that over 100 more composting sites are needed to process organics to meet the state’s goals.",https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Images/MMD/Food-Waste/Metro-Food-Rescue-NFL.jpg?rev=35bb65c6a606493eb4a918a21c54cff9,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:40.693192

However, tax credits for other sources of low-emission electricity, including nuclear power, hydropower and geothermal energy, will remain available until 2033.","Cuts to clean energy spending in the bill President Donald Trump signed into law on 4 July could lead to billions of tonnes of additional CO2 emissions over the next decade, according to early estimates. The US was already behind on its Paris Agreement pledge to cut emissions in half by 2030, and the slowdown will leave the country – the world’s second-largest emitter after China – even further off track.

“While other countries are benefiting from accelerated investment in the clean energy economy, the US is taking a step backwards,” David Widawsky at the World Resources Institute, an environmental advocacy group, said in a statement.

The sweeping legislation – known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” – contains more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and $350 billion in new spending for immigration enforcement and the military.

Republicans in Congress included funding cuts to clean energy, along with larger cuts to affordable healthcare and food programs, to offset that spending. Over the next few years, the law will end hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of tax credits aimed at boosting low-emission energy sources and uses established by the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed under the Biden administration.

Researchers at Princeton University modelled how the policy change would affect the US energy system and emissions over the next decade. They found the law substantially slows the decline in US greenhouse gas emissions that were expected under the Biden administration’s policies, effectively repealing the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since a peak of about 6.6 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in 2005, US emissions have declined by about 17 per cent and were set to fall by about 25 per cent by 2030. Under the new law, the decline is expected to be 20 per cent in 2030, a difference of hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2.

The difference is even more stark in 2035, when more clean energy projects were anticipated to have been built. Under Biden’s policies, emissions were set to fall as much as 44 per cent by then relative to 2005, according to the researchers. Under the new law, they would fall just 25 per cent, a disparity of half a billion tonnes of CO2 per year.

The slowdown would leave US emissions behind its former pledges under the Paris Agreement by about 2 billion tonnes in 2030. In 2035, US emissions would be around 2.5 billion tonnes higher than an emissions trajectory consistent with reaching net zero by mid-century.

The bill includes ending tax credits for electric vehicles this year and phasing out credits for low-emission renewable energy, such as wind and solar, in 2026. Credits for energy efficiency upgrades, such as heat pumps and home insulation, also now end in 2026. The bill cancels the remaining funding for clean energy-related research and development programs.

However, tax credits for other sources of low-emission electricity, including nuclear power, hydropower and geothermal energy, will remain available until 2033. The bill also maintains support for more speculative technologies favoured by the fossil fuel industry, including a tax credit for low-emissions hydrogen production that lasts until 2028 and credits for capturing or removing CO2 from the atmosphere.

Climate advocates decried the passage of the bill for its emissions consequences, as well as ways it could run counter to the Trump administration’s agenda to lower the cost of energy and expand American manufacturing.

“We urgently need more clean, affordable energy, but this measure would bring the renaissance in American clean energy production to a halt and send good, domestic manufacturing jobs to our foreign rivals,” Manish Bapna at the US-based advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement.",https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08191406/sei258255741.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:19.084315

The grant program, created and funded by Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to provide critical support to communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change. Attorney General Clark and the coalition argue that EPA’s abrupt and unlawful termination of the program and cancellation of grants have already caused widespread harm across their states, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, and are urging the court to block the program termination while the lawsuit continues.

In the brief filed today in Appalachian Voices v. EPA, Attorney General Clark and the coalition emphasize that by terminating this grant program, the federal government is inflicting serious, lasting harm on vulnerable communities already grappling with disproportionate pollution burdens and the escalating effects of climate change. These communities, which are often low-income, communities of color, indigenous, or in rural areas, face overlapping environmental and public health crises.

The attorneys general explain that these challenges have only been made worse by historical discriminatory policies including racial segregation, redlining, and a systemic lack of investment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These communities are often under-resourced with limited access to vital needs like clean drinking water and are less equipped to recover from devastating weather-related events or to mitigate the increasing impact of climate change within their communities.

In 2022, Congress created the grant program under the Inflation Reduction Act, mandating that EPA distribute $3 billion in funding specifically to help address these disparities. Now, the sudden termination of these grants has forced grantees to lay off staff, halt programming, and freeze hiring.

Attorney General Clark and the coalitionnote that EPA’s mass cancellation of the environmental and climate justice grant program violates clear congressional mandates and fundamental constitutional principles. Congress directed the EPA to distribute these funds using mandatory language in the Inflation Reduction Act, leaving the agency no discretion to unilaterally withdraw support.

The coalition is urging the court to grant plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and ensure that the environmental justice grants remain available for the communities that so desperately need them.

The EPA, the chief environmental organization of the United States, has faced enormous pressure in recent years as global warming has fueled more frequent extreme weather events and environmental disasters, and now the Trump administration has impacted the EPA even more.

The EPA Great Lakes Tracker is organized into several key categories useful for understanding and tracking the work and policies of the EPA in the Great Lakes region. Four of these categories relate to the direct work of the EPA: Beach grants; Superfund Sites; Brownfields; and PFAS (“forever chemicals”). The other four categories are unique to the Trump administration’s EPA, including: Regulatory Rollbacks; Employee Firings and Office Closures; and the President’s Budget. This tracker is being released at a critical time in the EPA’s history as the agency faces existential threats and weakened capabilities.

The tracker highlights ways in which the Trump EPA is at odds with itself. Despite EPA claims that emphasize environmental protection and human health, the agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, has gutted many of the programs that achieve these goals and rolled back limits intended to protect American lives. Even in areas that the EPA has held up as accomplishments, such as the cleanup of Superfund and Brownfield sites, the Trump administration is also proposing budget cuts that would undermine those programs in the future.

BEACH Act Grant Program

Last updated: July 1, 2025

The BEACH Act Grant Program funds water quality monitoring, communication in the event of unsafe conditions, and other public health initiatives at over 4,500 beaches nationwide, including those along the Great Lakes. These funds are used to determine if elevated levels of illness-causing bacteria make swimming unsafe and if so, to prevent the public from beachgoing until further notice. Under President Trump, the EPA continues to fund the program with $9.7 million in grants for 2025. The funding is authorized by the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act. Rep. David Joyce, Co-Chair of the Great Lakes Task Force, introduced legislation earlier this year that would reauthorize the program through FY 2029 at $30 million per year, equal to the current authorized level. Appropriated funding is currently on par with prior fiscal years. The FY 2026 President’s Budget for the EPA, however, would eliminate the BEACH Grant program, along with other Categorical Grants totaling nearly $1 billion.

Superfund

Last updated: July 1, 2025

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, or Superfund) mandates the EPA to clean up sites across the US contaminated by hazardous waste. Through this program, the areas are slated for cleanup and redeveloped into commercial, recreational, residential, and ecological spaces, such as shopping centers, parks, and more. This work is largely funded by the entities that polluted the areas in the first place. The Trump EPA has touted expedited Superfund cleanup as one of its major accomplishments. In 2025, Superfund sites from Rhode Island to Illinois have undergone major cleanups in an effort to combine environmental revitalization projects with economic development. As of May 1, 2025, $296 million in cleanups were confirmed across the US so far this year, addressing 700,000 cubic yards of contamination. The President’s Budget, however, would cut funding for the Hazardous Substances Superfund account in half, from $537 million in FY 2025 to just $282 million.

Brownfields

Last updated: July 1, 2025

Brownfield sites, former industrial sites that have been contaminated with hazardous substances or carry a risk of such contamination, are an important part of the EPA’s work in environmental restoration and offer incredible benefits for local economies and communities when redeveloped. On May 16, 2025, $267 million in Brownfields Grants were announced for selection to communities across the United States aimed at combining efforts in environmental stewardship and economic growth. This includes $224 million in funding for Brownfields Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup (ARC) Grant programs; and $42 million in supplemental funding to 34 existing Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) Grant recipients demonstrating successful brownfield site cleanup and redevelopment. However, current threats to EPA funding, namely the proposed 54% cut to the organization’s budget for FY 2026, would slow down projects and the success of brownfield redevelopment. A March 11 hearing held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on the Environment emphasized the importance of this program and concern about how these cuts might affect brownfield revitalization. Namely, these cuts would deepen administrative delays and barriers, and disproportionately affect disadvantaged communities. The administration’s budget for FY 2026 cuts funding for the Brownfields Projects State and Tribal Assistance Grant from $98 million to $80 million and would completely eliminate funding for the Brownfield Categorical Grant program, funded at $46 million in FY 2025. Cuts to the EPA’s payroll for its staff have also delayed the acquisition of grants and made it difficult to get in contact with individuals from the agency.

With the Brownfields Program, the Trump administration illustrates that its agenda is continuously at odds with itself. Although the current EPA emphasizes the importance of environmental revitalization programs, the administration’s actions fail to align with this priority, and in fact gut the very programs that make revitalization possible.

PFAS

Last updated: July 1, 2025

PFAS, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as “forever chemicals,” are chemical substances used in a wide variety of consumer products from clothing to cookware. PFAS break down very slowly in the environment, allowing them to accumulate in the environment, most worryingly in soil and drinking water sources. PFAS have been linked to negative health outcomes such as cholesterol increases, lower birth weight, reduced immune response, fertility issues, and kidney, prostate, and testicular cancers.

The EPA has continued its emphasis on addressing the contamination of natural environments by these chemical substances. Proposed efforts under Administrator Zeldin in late April, including the formation of an agency focused on PFAS, the creation of effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) to prevent them from entering drinking water systems, the strengthening of cleanup efforts in water supplies impacted by PFAS contamination, and procedures for holding polluters accountable through investigations and liability frameworks. A complete list of proposed EPA actions for combatting PFAS contamination can be found here.

The Trump EPA also partially rolled back Biden-era PFAS drinking water limits. While the EPA has maintained limits on PFOA and PFOS, enforcement is delayed until 2031. Additionally, the agency removed and weakened regulations on other forms of PFAS on May 14. Specifically, the EPA “is also announcing its intent to rescind the regulations and reconsider the regulatory determinations for” PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA. The MCL for those PFAS had been set at 10 ppt. The EPA will also do away with a hazard index that would measure and regulate those three PFAS plus PFBS collectively even if their individual concentrations were not above 10 ppt. These changes are likely to see legal challenges because of the Safe Drinking Water Act’s “no backsliding” provision preventing EPA from weakening its rules. Separately, the Trump EPA has been granted more time to decide whether it wants to defend the Biden-era rules in court cases dating back to before the Trump administration began. The latest extension runs out in late July. Regardless of that decision, the court will still need to rule on the legality of the rule, though more delays could come.

A ProPublica investigation has also revealed that the EPA has cancelled grants for research into PFAS. This comes in direct conflict with the EPA of Trump’s first term which stressed the importance of understanding forever chemicals and their effects on the environment. It also conflicts with claims made by Administrator Zeldin in April that the EPA will go through great lengths to ensure air, land, and water are clean from PFAS. Grant cancellations combined with potential cuts to the agency’s budget could undermine the EPA’s ability to protect Americans from PFAS.

Regulatory Rollbacks

Last updated: July 1, 2025

Perhaps the most prominent and consequential of the Trump administration’s government efforts is its regulatory rollbacks. Under the leadership of Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has focused much of its attention on repealing and reducing regulations, and cutting spending deemed “wasteful,” including diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental justice programs.

In early February, Zeldin announced the agency’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, consisting of five pillars to guide the EPA’s work. Of these, pillars 2, 3, and 5 focus on regulatory rollbacks. Pillar 2 aims to “restore American energy dominance,” language echoing Trump’s campaign promise to maximize petroleum and gas as key energy sources. Pillar 3 aims to stimulate investment by streamlining permit processes. Finally, pillar 5 focuses on bringing back American auto jobs, and calls for the streamlining and development of “smart regulations” that may loosen environmental protections. This pillar also takes aim at Biden-era policies designed to reduce emissions from gas-powered cars. These regulatory cuts once again exemplify the current administration’s dissonant policy approach, as it permits environmentally destructive practices on one hand while claiming to support clean air and water on the other.

March 12 was what Zeldin called “the greatest and most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history” for the EPA. Administrator Zeldin announced the rollback of 31 Biden era actions ranging in focus from electric vehicles to air pollution. Many of these were reconsiderations or revisions of major regulations, including regulatory flexibility for oil and gas wastewater usage and reviewing wastewater regulations for coal burning power plants. It also included attempts to scrap the Clean Power Plan 2.0 regulation that would require all coal plants and new natural gas plants to use carbon capture technology to capture 90% of their carbon dioxide emissions by 2032 if they planned to be operational in 2040. Three rules that focused on setting stricter standards for gas-powered cars and encouraging emissions reductions technologies are also under review.

Zeldin also announced a review of the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) after the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. United States to limit the bodies of water that the EPA has jurisdiction over. Particularly, the Court found in Sackett that wetlands without “a continuous surface connection to bodies of water of the United States in their own right,” are not covered. The Biden EPA rewrote the rule in 2023 to comply with Sackett while maintaining the administration’s priorities around clean water protections, though conservatives charged that the rule was unclear and did not properly implement the ruling. The EPA wants to ensure the revised rule “follows the law, reduces red-tape, cuts overall permitting costs, and lowers the cost of doing business in communities across the country while protecting the nation’s navigable waters from pollution,” the agency wrote in a press release.

Significantly, the EPA will embark on “a formal reconsideration” of the 2009 endangerment finding. This finding was an EPA determination based on the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA that the agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as a public health hazard. The attempt to reverse this finding, which will invite legal challenges, could unravel all of EPA’s existing climate regulations and prevent the agency from imposing regulations in the future.

In June, EPA Administrator Zeldin announced two proposals to “restore American energy dominance.” The first plan proposes repealing “all greenhouse gas emissions standards for the power sector under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act.” More specifically, this means the emission guidelines for existing power plants, and carbon capture and sequestration/storage-based requirements for new combustion turbines and modified coal plants. The EPA claims this proposal would ensure reliable energy supplies and drive down costs in manufacturing, farming, transportation, heating, and utilities. The Biden EPA claimed that the rules would limit pollution “without disrupting the delivery of reliable electricity,” and would provide annualized net benefits of $19 billion per year. The second plan proposes repealing amendments to the 2024 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) that limited emissions from coal-fired power plants. The EPA touts that a reversal would save roughly $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade, though when the amendments were originally announced, the agency estimated that enacting the stricter MATS standards would save $24 billion per year. MATS has been highly effective in protecting public health and the environment, having decreased mercury emissions by 86 percent, acid gas hazardous air pollutants by 96 percent and non-mercury metals by 81 percent between 2010 and 2017. Administrator Zeldin argues that these facilities contribute little to climate pollution globally and that regulations are only harming Americans via the price of lower energy production capacity.

Employee Firings and Office Closures

Last updated: July 1, 2025

The Trump Administration, through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has removed federal employees en masse. In February, nearly 25,000 probationary federal employees were laid off, including 419 at the EPA. These employees have fewer civil service protections than other federal employees and have been at their job for one or two years or fewer. This does not necessarily mean that these employees are inexperienced; on the contrary, among the firings are longtime employees who were recently promoted, putting them on probationary status. Probationary employees were reinstated in mid-March as a result of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by a federal judge in Maryland. However, by mid-April the administration resumed these firings after a preliminary injunction in Maryland was struck down and another in California was invalidated. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has emphasized goals for staff totals to return to levels last seen under former President Ronald Reagan, although has not communicated concrete employment goals.

Documents reviewed by Democratic staff on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology reveal EPA plans to lay off as many as 1,155 scientists, 75% of the agency’s research staff. These plans also included calls to dissolve the EPA’s Office of Research and Development, which, as of March, had 1,540 positions. Remaining staff are to be reassigned to other agency offices “to provide increased oversight and align with administration priorities.” For the Great Lakes region, this may significantly impact EPA labs in Cincinnati and Duluth. The Andrew W. Breidenbach Environmental Research Center in Cincinnati is the second largest in the US and 7.7.17.pdf"">employs hundreds of individuals in the Greater Cincinnati area while providing the research basis for many decisions that keep ecosystems and humans healthy and safe from environmental pollutants. The Great Lakes Toxicology and Ecology Division (GTLED) Lab in Duluth employs over 130 scientists, contributes over $15 million to the economy, and is vital in keeping Lake Superior clean and healthy. Minnesota Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tina Smith (D-MN) have 94.2025.04.02-zeldin-letter-ajk-edits-template-clean-final.pdf"">written to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to express their concerns and call on him to protect the GTLED Lab. Amid these firings, however, the EPA also announced the hiring of at least 130 scientific, technical, bioinformatic, and information technology experts to the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) with the goal of working on the backlogs of over 504 chemicals and over 12,000 pesticides needing review.

In carrying out the Trump administration’s executive order calling for an end to government diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, the EPA announced the termination of the agency’s DEI and environmental justice arms. To carry out such action, the EPA began a Reduction in Force (RIF) for approximately 280 DEI and environmental justice employees. Additionally, the EPA is in the process of dismantling its Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights. This included placing 11 employees in DEI and 160 in environmental justice roles on administrative leave. Administrator Zeldin also intends to reorganize and eliminate offices of environmental justice at all 10 EPA regional offices and the agency’s DC office. These offices address the disproportionate levels of pollution and contamination affecting low-income and minority communities, and their closures would end much of the work aimed at reducing the burden of environmental injustices.

The President’s Budget

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines.
And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.
“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email.
Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.","President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday that he said will “end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources” such as wind and solar.

But it’s not clear whether the order will have much of an effect other than to underscore the president’s antipathy for those power sources. Some observers speculate this action is fulfilling a promise to hardline conservative House members in order to win their votes last week for the massive budget reconciliation bill.

The order is titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.” It directs the Treasury department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits” as specified by the bill.

The legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed on July 4, says that projects must begin construction by mid-2026 or be placed in service by the end of 2027. This is a rapid phaseout compared to the previous law that had a phaseout that was to begin in 2032.

The executive order advises the Treasury department to allow no wiggle room on the new deadlines. It also says the department must take prompt action to follow the bill’s new limits on tax credits going to entities with ties to China.

In addition, it says the Department of the Interior must revise any policies or practices that give solar and wind power preferential treatment compared to other energy sources.

The Treasury and Interior departments also must make reports within 45 days about how they are complying with the order.

Analysts, lawmakers and officials from renewable energy industry groups had mixed reactions about the significance of the order.

But they do not downplay the effects of the bill that has become law. It is a gutting of incentives from President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act that will reduce federal government support for renewable energy, electric vehicles and manufacturing of those products and related components. The result, according to reports from Rhodium Group, Princeton University’s REPEAT Project, the think tank Energy Innovation and the Clean Energy Buyers Association, is likely to be a decrease in U.S. jobs and an increase in electricity prices.

And yet, the executive order is likely to have minimal additional effect, said Pavel Molchanov, a managing director for the investment firm Raymond James.

“Contrary to the EO’s headline, the EO does not abolish any tax credits,” he said in an email. “To state the obvious, only Congress can change tax law—which, in fact, is what Congress did last week via the budgetary megabill.”

He expects little or no practical effect from the Interior department provision

“It is worth noting that, under the Federal Power Act, the government cannot favor one type of power generation over another,” he said. “Thus, the EO simply restates existing law in that regard.”

Derrick Flakoll, a senior policy associate for BloombergNEF, sees much greater potential for harm to the wind and solar industries.

“It’s a big deal, but how big a deal it is we don’t know,” he said.

He explained that the order is attempting to create uncertainty around the 2026 deadline, which is a crucial deadline for projects to have a smooth path to qualifying for tax credits.

“It could push a lot of projects out of eligibility or into such an uncertain state of eligibility that it becomes hard to build and finance them,” he said.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, offered this statement:

“This executive order appears to target long-standing and well-established tax standards that allow for realistic financing timelines for all sorts of energy projects—including solar, wind, carbon capture and hydrogen projects,” she said. “We will continue to make the case that business certainty, predictability, and even-handedness are bedrocks of federal policy that cannot be undone by the stroke of a pen. We expect the Treasury Department to follow the law.”

Rep. Sean Casten (D-Illinois), who has a background running clean energy businesses, said the order is about helping the market for fossil fuels by harming competing sources of electricity.

“Donald Trump doesn’t hate renewable energy because it is clean,” he said in an email. “He hates it because it’s cheap. His latest executive orders are about making it harder for Americans to access cheap and reliable energy to ensure he keeps profits up for his friends in the fossil fuel industry.”

Taylor Rogers, an assistant press secretary for Trump, pushed back on concerns that the president’s actions would lead to higher energy prices.

“No one takes disingenuous cost concerns seriously from ‘clean energy’ groups that supported a $200 billion tax hike on the American people to fund the Green New Scam,” she said. “The One Big Beautiful Bill will continue to unleash America’s energy industry, dropping electricity costs that increased dramatically due to Joe Biden’s climate agenda.”

She listed the many aspects of the bill that increase oil and gas production and reduce regulations, which she said will cut costs for consumers.

Her response to questions did not include any comment about whether the executive order was part of a commitment made to Congressional Republicans.

The budget bill passed the House on Friday, 218-214, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting against it. Several fiscally conservative House members initially balked at the spending levels in the bill, but most of them ended up voting for it after meeting with Trump.

Asked about how Trump had earned their votes, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told CNBC on Friday that the president had told members he would use executive powers to stop renewable energy sources from being able to use subsidies.

“A lot of these subsidies won’t remain in effect from here on out,” Norman said.

He posted on Facebook on Tuesday that the order was “a pledge [Trump] had made, and one he kept.”

He added, “I proudly support an all-of-the-above energy approach—ensuring coal, gas, nuclear, hydropower, and yes, responsibly advanced renewables can compete in an honest market. THIS is how you make energy policy work for everyday Americans, not special interests.”

It’s not much of a stretch to see a connection between Norman’s comment on CNBC and the executive order, said Glen Brand, vice president of policy and advocacy for Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that works to expand access to rooftop solar.

“I assume that this is the direct response to that promise,” he said.

He said it’s difficult to predict the ramifications of the order without knowing how federal agencies will choose to respond.

“It all depends on how Treasury interprets the guidance. It could be nothing. It could be a lot,” he said.

Brand believes the order’s intent was to increase uncertainty and discourage companies from using the tax credits, which it may succeed in doing even if it doesn’t lead to any substantive changes in the way the credits work.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2198226868-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:28.683263

It’s unclear how much demand there is for new development.

New coal leasing in the nation’s top producing coal region has been under a moratorium imposed by the Biden administration late last year, largely based on its contribution to climate change. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) adopted that wording to resource management plans for its Buffalo and Miles City field offices in late November. The agency estimated existing mining activity would dry up by the end of 2040.

Shortly after in December, Montana and Wyoming sued. Industry leaders and Wyoming politicians have voiced that they think the BLM’s November decision was an attack on Wyoming’s top money maker.

Then in April, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) held up a sparkly, black rock before his fellow lawmakers.

“This is Wyoming coal,” he said. “We need more of it, not less of it to power our nation.”

That belief was echoed in several of Pres. Trump’s executive orders, including some signed in April.

“It’s part of this bold plan the administration has to restore American energy dominance,” said Barrasso.

Those orders are helping to amend the BLM’s Powder River Basin resource plans. The agency announced this week it’s considering reopening coal leasing, specifically tying the choice to Trump’s plan for “Unleashing American Energy.”

The BLM’s official notice of intent document was published July 8. It outlines two options for the future amendment. The first action is a no action/current decision, which would keep the area closed to new coal leasing. The second option is the “proposed action,” which would open the 1,214,380 acres “for further consideration for coal leasing.” The public has until August 7th to weigh in.

A 30-day public comment period for this type of plan amendment is “not normal,” according to conservation group Earthjustice. They added that prior to this, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations required 45 days. However, the Trump administration is dismantling the federal act, which was signed into law in 1970. It intended to protect the environment as much as possible and involved the public along the way.

A White House press release said they’re streamlining the act to “simplify this overly burdensome process and ensure efficient and timely environmental reviews.” This is also in support of the administration’s plan to Unleash American Energy.

“We will end the government bias against coal and we’re going to unlock the Defense Production Act to turbo charge coal mining in America,” Trump said in an April press conference where he signed several executive orders. “They made it impossible.”

Trump said Democrats have hampered the coal industry. However, coal has continued to decline under both Republican and Democratic presidents, including during Trump’s first presidency.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b8a6a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd9%2F45%2F0e03f3274348bc8e3045734de79d%2Fcoal-powder-river-basin.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:17:04.817799

But the other thing is, if you have a bad front trunk experience, which could be both [that] its very small, or you don't have cinching, meaning you have to push, like if you've had a rear-engine car like a Porsche, it's always very weird to push down in the hood. You do it, and you can feel the hood bow a little bit every time you do it, and the whole experience makes you feel like, ""I don't want to do that."" And in R1, it powers up [and] powers down, so it's very different. In R2, it doesn't power down, but it cinches. You just get it close enough, and it pulls it in. But not having to push on a Class A surface, we think, is a big deal.

And even with, like, I've owned multiple Teslas, I'd say it's one of the things that deterred me from using the front trunk on my Model Y, that I never went to dent the hood, pushing them. But the data for us has been very compelling.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/automakers-that-claim-owners-dont-use-ev-frunks-are-probably-lying-or-just-make-bad-frunks-says-rivian-ceo-rj-scaringe/l-intro-1752001044.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:14:09.197130

Planet Detroit’s Voices column includes opinion pieces from our community of partners and readers.","Detroit is facing extreme heat. Last month, it was unhealthy air quality due to wildfire smoke layered onto local pollution. Over the winter, an entire neighborhood suffered the effects of a cold snap coupled with severe water infrastructure failure.

In Detroit, we are constantly preparing for storms on both political and climate fronts as we weather increasingly devastating levels of rainfall amidst decades of disinvestment, overwhelming our infrastructure and flooding our basements and streets.

Additionally, forceful storms and extreme heat interact with heavy industry and outdated systems to exacerbate the financial and health impacts of weather emergencies, according to The New York Times. Here, as elsewhere, we see the strength of unanticipated storms impacting generations to come.

With the current presidential administration, those of us invested in community development and climate planning are already underwater from the impacts of a new era of scarce federal support as Trump’s team slashes funding, dismisses climate crises, and belittles communities most at risk.

In this critical absence of federal resources, which exacerbates preexisting inadequacies and insufficient oversight, Detroit and other American cities must embrace a hyperlocal approach to climate adaptation that supports neighborhood health and wellness.

Community-led strategies must drive neighborhood climate response, meeting immediate needs and in turn informing local policy measures and resource distribution.

Local expertise and resident networks are critical to climate response. I say this as a community-engaged architect and planner with years of experience addressing climate issues at the local level and working alongside residents to elevate community voices in the decision-making that impacts their neighborhoods.

Detroit stormwater project, resilience hubs highlight community climate response

In the last two decades, I have worked with community design practices in the Mississippi Gulf Coast, Lower Rio Grande Valley, and Detroit to design spaces and develop adaptive strategies that leverage local assets, respond to the environment, and prepare for the next storm.

These resident-driven design and planning solutions lead to more responsive, grounded and equitable climate action, which ought to inform top-down decisions tied to relief resources and infrastructure investment.

On Detroit’s east side, community leaders have envisioned green stormwater infrastructure that manages heavy rains via planted landscapes and meets multiple local needs including land stabilization and beautification as well as flood reduction tied to climate change and aging infrastructure. This work proposes an alternative to pricey underground water infrastructure while pushing for policy change that would enable community-level landscape solutions.

More recently, neighborhood organizations and resident leaders have launched a network of resilience hubs that serve Detroiters in times of climate emergency. The resilience hubs leverage social networks and a dispersed infrastructure of existing, trusted community spaces across the eastside.

Philanthropy and city staff committed to community sustainability are supporting and enabling these efforts. Simultaneously, community groups are urgently advocating for reliable regulation that will ensure healthy water, air, and infrastructure for the city’s next generation. Much of this work is led by the highly engaged and productive Eastside Community Network, and other allied groups.

Both grassroots and policy solutions needed to weather climate change

Critically, social networks strengthen the local infrastructure that supports community resilience. The importance of social capital in disaster response is well documented as the single-most impactful element in recovery (see the work of Daniel Aldrich).

The community-led processes and spaces that are alive and well in Detroit reinforce place-based networks that build community connections. Along these lines, the MIT Healthy Neighborhoods Study emphasizes that “when it comes to building healthy communities it’s not just what is built, but the sense of power, control, and direct benefit that residents of those communities have over what is built that matters for health,” making the case for increased community input in planning for climate infrastructure for health outcomes at the local level.

Without a doubt, to meet increasing need and adequately support communities to prepare, adapt and respond to climate emergencies, solutions must operate at both the grassroots and policy level. Climate strategies must balance professional and community expertise and integrate infrastructure systems with fine-grained interventions.

Community networks with local knowledge and lived experience are best positioned to respond in times of crisis and are integral to local action that ought to drive policy decisions. And in the absence of climate leadership at the federal level under Trump, we must act locally, as poignantly called for by climate activist and author Ayana Elizabeth Johnson.

Community engagement in infrastructure planning and climate response that derives from the hyperlocal context is imperative to build equitable systems and policies that work.

Residents should not have to advocate to be heard, or for their own health and safety, as they seek to weather storms caused by climate change. The recognition of and support for community expertise and strategies will more effectively and equitably meet local needs during climate catastrophes and result in exponential and tangible benefits with citywide implications.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-07-08 19:05:13+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Controversial Ford battery plant 'on track' to remain eligible for key federal support,The Detroit News,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/08/ford-battery-plant/,"WASHINGTON — Ford Motor Co. confirmed Tuesday that its multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan remains “on track” to qualify for a crucial federal tax credit, despite new federal restrictions on sourcing from China.
The credit in question, also known as the 45X credit, targets battery producers and upstream industries.
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford originally said ineligibility of the production tax credit would “imperil” the $3 billion plant expected to create 1,700 jobs.
The executives underscored that if EVs are going to be affordable, the company needs the advanced Chinese battery technology, and if it cannot build those cells economically in the United States, it will have to source from elsewhere.
Detroit-based General Motors Co. plans to do so, as well, until it can domestically produce lithium manganese-rich batteries, a technology Ford also is developing.","WASHINGTON — Ford Motor Co. confirmed Tuesday that its multibillion-dollar battery plant in south-central Michigan remains “on track” to qualify for a crucial federal tax credit, despite new federal restrictions on sourcing from China.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” company spokesperson Robyn Jackson said in a statement. “BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit — a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

The Marshall, Michigan, plant has been controversial because of Ford’s agreement to license technology from Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. at the new facility, an arrangement that sparked backlash and threatened business plans with some 60% of construction complete.

The new federal restrictions came via Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive tax cut and spending package that President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend. An earlier U.S. House version of the bill would have torpedoed Ford’s eligibility for the federal Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, but an all-out lobbying effort helped the Dearborn-based automaker secure favorable changes in the U.S. Senate.

The credit in question, also known as the 45X credit, targets battery producers and upstream industries. Battery cells, which store and release energy needed to power EVs, are each eligible for a credit of $35 per kilowatt-hour of energy they can store and $10 per kilowatt-hour for battery modules or pack assembly. The Marshall plant’s capacity is 20 gigawatt-hours per year.

Ford’s company statement uses careful language to describe its tax credit status, as the U.S. Department of the Treasury still needs to finalize implementation guidelines based on the congressional directive. Those guidelines will more firmly determine the plant’s eligibility.

Ford CEO Jim Farley has called the credit “critical for our industry,” but the House bill explicitly excluded components made as a product of licensing agreements with prohibited foreign entities — a designation that applies to CATL. The final Senate version removed that language.

Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford originally said ineligibility of the production tax credit would “imperil” the $3 billion plant expected to create 1,700 jobs. Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of technology platform programs and EV systems, later clarified that the automaker planned to “stick behind” Marshall, but said losing the credit could delay production and hiring.

The executives underscored that if EVs are going to be affordable, the company needs the advanced Chinese battery technology, and if it cannot build those cells economically in the United States, it will have to source from elsewhere.

Renewable Energy Batteries The new law requires that any renewable energy storage facility obtain a permit from LDENR prior to battery installation.","Louisiana has a new renewable energy law on the books, Act No. 279, set to take effect on August 1, 2025. It provides for the regulation of solar facilities, renewable energy batteries, and onshore wind projects, all under the permitting authority of the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources (LDENR). The solar facility piece of the legislation comes in response to several parishes grappling with recent divisions over large-scale solar project proposals. Act No. 279 is notable in that it grants the state permitting authority and mandates solar project siting requirements, yet it carves out an exception whereby parish governments may elect to impose their own, potentially more restrictive, siting requirements. A summary of the new requirements for each renewable energy category is as follows.

Solar Facilities

Any solar power generation project with a footprint of 75 acres or more must obtain a permit from LDENR. In addition, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries may weigh in and comment on the project permit.

The new law also contains siting requirements related to setbacks and noise levels that apply to solar facilities with a footprint of 75 acres or more and that begin construction after January 1, 2026. However, there are notable exceptions to these siting requirements:

Parish governments that create their own siting requirements can opt out of the state siting requirements.

Facilities located completely within an industrial-zoned area or a Louisiana Economic Development-certified site are excepted from the siting requirements.

Residential property owners may opt out of certain siting requirements under a written agreement with the solar project’s operator.

The new law’s setback requirements are generally 300-feet from adjacent residential property lines; 100-feet from the ordinary low watermark of natural and navigable waterways; and 50-feet from the edge of public roads. Additional vegetative barrier requirements were also adopted. In addition, the act prohibits noise levels greater than 10 A-weighted decibels (dbA) above the pre-project operation ambient noise level at the project’s property line.

Renewable Energy Batteries

The new law requires that any renewable energy storage facility obtain a permit from LDENR prior to battery installation. Proof of financial security and a decommissioning plan are also required. LDENR has been directed to promulgate rules to implement these requirements by August 31, 2026.

Onshore Wind Energy

The new law prohibits the construction or completion of any onshore wind project without a permit from LDENR. Proof of financial security and a decommissioning plan are required as part of the permitting process. LDENR has been directed to promulgate rules to implement these requirements by August 31, 2026.

You talk about how one of the challenges in the EV industry is that consumers only have a few choices for a sub-$50,000 EV, e.g., the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y.
You're going to see these big networks emerge in much the same way that gas station and that infrastructure was built out.
Having more companies focused on the US auto industry would be much better for the US auto industry, much better for the US as a country, and certainly better for my kids.","Much has changed for the EV industry in the past half-decade, let alone in the 16 years since Rivian, the California-based electric vehicle maker, was founded.

Legacy automakers, from GM to Volkswagen, have begun to build out their EV platforms. The Biden administration introduced unique measures to supercharge EV adoption, and China has emerged as a dominant electric vehicle player.

Yet, EVs remain a brutal business.

Sales have slowed worldwide. Tesla and Rivian are two of the few all-electric US automakers with any skin in the game, and the second Trump administration has moved to put the previous administration's EV push to a screeching halt.

The Big Beautiful Bill, which cuts EV tax credits introduced by the Biden administration, was signed into law on July 4.

Rivian's CEO, RJ Scaringe, has maintained that the EV credits will have minimal impact on his company. However, the CEO recently told reporters that the current administration's posture could be bad for the overall US auto industry.

""I think that the move away from some of the tailwinds that were previously in place for electric vehicles is actually good for Rivian, it's good for Tesla, it's bad for the US auto industry, and it's bad for my kids,"" he said.

Rivian invited media outlets to preview the company's latest quad-motor platform for its second-generation R1 truck and SUV, which is priced from $116,000 to $126,000, in South Lake Tahoe, California.

During a roundtable interview on June 25, Business Insider asked Scaringe for his thoughts on Trump's Big Beautiful Bill, what hurdles lie ahead for the industry, and why Rivian wants to produce a $120,000 truck and SUV as average consumers look for cheaper vehicle options.

The following, which only includes questions from Business Insider, was edited for length and clarity.

You talk about how one of the challenges in the EV industry is that consumers only have a few choices for a sub-$50,000 EV, e.g., the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y. Where does a $120K quad-motor vehicle fit into that equation?

Well, the quad is a flagship powertrain and a flagship vehicle. It's great for the brand, but it's sort of an exercise in unnecessary capability. It's so quick, it's so capable off-road. The torque factoring characteristics are remarkable and it's well beyond what one would need, but it's great for building awareness and brand. There are a lot of customers, particularly R1 customers, that just want the best of what we can make. And so it's for that customer.

But it's not a high-volume product, whereas R2, with a starting price of $45,000, will be very, very high volume. It's a totally different customer demographic and totally different trade-offs we have to make at the product level, but it needs to feel cohesive and consistent with the brand and the way we approach solving the technical problems in the vehicle.

Rivian is unveiling a lot of features in the quad, like the real auto dynamics tuner. I'm curious when you look at what the Jeff Bezos-backed Slate company is doing with a simple, bare-bones truck and the general direction of the market — I'm curious if you see that and think, ""Do we need all this? Do we need all these fun features?""

Again, I think it's awesome that there are different teams of people that come up with different answers to the question of how you design a car. So we're obviously building a software-forward vehicle. It's very tech-forward. The existence of a concept like Slate, of course, doesn't challenge our perception of how we're approaching inserting technology and having a really software-rich environment. But they're going to go for a different customer, and the market needs lots of choices. So I think it's good to see that.

On the way up, I spoke with a Rivian owner who said the biggest barrier for her right now is finding an available fast-charging station. We've been talking about EVs for decades. Here, we have a very capable EV car, but we're still dealing with basic things like finding a working charging station. How do you react to that?

I 100% agree. If you'd asked me six or seven years ago, I would've said emphatically that charging is going to get built out. You're going to see private investments flow into it. You're going to see these big networks emerge in much the same way that gas station and that infrastructure was built out. We went from zero gas stations to 100,000 gas stations in like 10 years. Today, there are about 160,000 gas stations in the United States.

But charging stations have been woefully underinvested in such that you have one dominant strong network with Tesla. It's a great network, with outstanding performance and high uptime. We've partnered with them to allow access to version three or newer chargers. But outside that, all the networks are really, honestly quite awful because the uptime is terrible. So you go to a charging location, and you expect it to work, but two of the three chargers, or four of the six, don't work. You have to queue for the ones that are working. Because of that, we decided to build our own network as well — something we call the Rivian Adventure Network (RAN).

It's small. I mean, it's 4% the size of Tesla's network, but it's growing rapidly. And importantly, it's one of two networks in the United States that have uptime north of 99% — obviously, Tesla being the other.

We designed all the hardware ourselves and then built it all ourselves. We build it all in our plants in Normal, Illinois. And so we're going to be continuing to build that. And again, I never would've imagined we'd be building one of the strongest networks in the United States. I didn't think we'd need to do that. But as it's playing out, I think there's going to be far fewer networks than we ever expected. Today, I'd say there are two networks that are great if the metric is uptime. There are maybe four or five networks that have more than, call it, 600 or 700 chargers. But it's really, really underbuilt. And so we're actively building that out. New RAN stations are popping up, a couple every week. So it's a big focus for us and a huge spend category for us as well.

The current administration is a little more hostile to EVs. We have the Big Beautiful Bill, for example. Mike Murphy, a GOP operative and CEO of the EV Politics Project, told The New York Times that the bill was a ""big win for China and bad for American manufacturing."" Do you share that sentiment?

I agree. I think that policy changes, in the end, don't change anything. We're going to electrify. And it's really important the United States continues to lead there, and I think that the move away from some of the tailwinds that were previously in place for electric vehicles is actually good for Rivian, it's good for Tesla, it's bad for the US auto industry, and it's bad for my kids.

Having more companies focused on the US auto industry would be much better for the US auto industry, much better for the US as a country, and certainly better for my kids.

We're basically on an island fighting all the other OEMs. They would never say this publicly, because publicly they're pro-EVs — but the biggest adversaries against electrification are big OEMs. So we fight that hard. It's so frustrating to see companies talk out of both sides of their mouth when they say they're pro-electrification, but they're just gloves off on the policy side. So anti-EV. I think the challenge is, in the short term, that will maximize profits; in the long term, when you have a completely different set of leaders in place in the 2030s, it's going to be really challenging for these companies that under-invest in this space.",https://i.insider.com/6869f230f748d8c055f507a8?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 16:16:07.367346

Background

In December 2024, the Biden Administration’s Department of Energy (DOE) published a long-awaited update to the agency’s analysis of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The multi-volume analysis, termed the 2024 LNG Export Study, represents the most comprehensive government assessment to-date of the energy, economic, and environmental impacts of U.S. LNG exports.

Key findings

Major proposed LNG projects would fail to achieve the “climate neutrality” benchmark put forward by a 2024 federal analysis (“2024 LNG Study”) to inform the review of LNG export applications under the Natural Gas Act.

As a result, pending LNG export applications appear to be inconsistent with the U.S. public interest and would drive up global greenhouse gas emissions. This finding is robust across policy/technology assumptions that the U.S. government included in the 2024 LNG Study.

Even if major steps were taken to clean up the gas supply chain, U.S. exports would be inconsistent with the 1.5ºC climate goal. This is because LNG expansion drives up energy demand and displaces renewable energy in importing markets, according to the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) that underlies the government study.

LNG projects are a risky investment. They take years to build and decades to pay off, and the Natural Gas Act authorizes the U.S. government to rescind export authorizations that are deemed inconsistent with the public interest.

LNG expansion harms communities and working families. The massive growth in LNG infrastructure along the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast is already having significant public health impacts, and threatening coastal communities and ecosystems in the process.

termination of 7 clean energy tax credits in 2025 or 2026

On July 7, 2025, the President issued a related Executive Order (the “BOC Order”) regarding the rapid termination of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar. This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (“BOC”) by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that “[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An “advanced nuclear facility” is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner’s credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.”

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a “specified foreign entity,” a “foreign-influenced entity,” or an entity that receives “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity.” Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A “prohibited foreign entity” (“PFE”) is defined as either a “specified foreign entity” (“SFE”) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (“FIE”).

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a “foreign-controlled entity” (“FCE”) or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a “foreign entity of concern,” a “designated foreign terrorist organization,” or a “Chinese military company operating in the United States.” An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A “covered nation” is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an “effective control” test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an “eligible component” under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute “effective control.” These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that “within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives “material assistance” from a PFE. Whether “material assistance” has been received is determined by comparing the “material assistance cost ratio” for such property to a “threshold percentage.”

The material assistance cost ratio (“Cost Ratio”) of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and “material assistance,” the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this “freeze” of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President’s direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide “new and revised” guidance regarding the meaning of “beginning of construction” for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with “effective control” over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 45U—Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 45V—Clean Hydrogen Production Credit None None None Section 45X—Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

“Eligible components” do not include any property which includes material assistance from a PFE for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but “effective control” test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit

No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

The following is a summary of some of the key provisions from the BBBA:

BUSINESS TAX PROVISIONS

Some of the key provisions impacting businesses include the following:

1. Extension of Deduction for Qualified Business Income, REIT Dividends and MLP Income. Under pre-BBBA law, an individual generally may deduct 20 percent of qualified business income from a partnership, S corporation, or sole proprietorship, as well as 20 percent of certain real estate investment trust dividends and publicly traded partnership income. For taxpayers with taxable income in excess of certain specified threshold amounts, the deduction for qualified business income is in most cases limited based on (1) the W-2 wages and unadjusted basis of tangible, depreciable property of each relevant business and (2) whether each relevant business is a specified service trade or business. This deduction was set to expire for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA makes the deduction permanent and makes relatively minor modifications to the manner in which the limitations are phased in for taxpayers with taxable income above the threshold amounts for such taxable years, as well as including a minimum deduction of $400 (plus inflation adjustments) for certain taxpayers.

2. Extension of “Bonus” Depreciation Allowance for Certain Property. The BBBA permanently extends the “bonus” depreciation provisions in the TCJA allowing taxpayers to immediately expense 100% of the cost of qualified property (including most equipment and machinery) acquired after January 19, 2025.

3. Increased Dollar Limitations for Expensing of Certain Depreciable Business Assets. Under pre-BBBA law (IRC section 179) a taxpayer may elect to expense the cost of qualifying property, rather than to recover such costs through depreciation deductions, up to a maximum amount of $1 million (plus inflation adjustments) for the taxable year. This $1 million limitation is reduced by the amount by which the cost of such property placed in service during the taxable year exceeds $2.5 million (plus inflation adjustments).

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the BBBA increases the $1 million limitation and $2.5 million phase-out threshold to $2.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively, adjusted for inflation.

4. Deduction of R&E Expenditures. Pre-BBBA law requires that qualifying domestic research and experimental expenditures be amortized over 5 years. The BBBA allows taxpayers to (1) immediately deduct domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 and (2) accelerate the deduction of remaining unamortized domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2025. Notably, however, there is a specific exclusion for and, thus, immediate deductibility does not apply to, any expenditure paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas). Additionally, certain small business taxpayers are permitted to apply these changes retroactively for domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021.

5. Special Depreciation Allowance for Qualified Production Property. The BBBA provides for an immediate deduction for 100% of the cost of certain depreciable real property used as an integral part of a qualified production activity if, among other things, (i) the property is placed in service in the U.S. or any possession of the U.S., (ii) the original use of the property begins with the taxpayer, (iii) the construction of the property begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029 and (iv) the property is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031. A “qualified production activity” generally means the manufacturing, chemical or agricultural production, or refining of tangible personal property. An activity generally does not count as a qualified production activity unless it results in a substantial transformation of the property comprising a product.

6. Modified Calculation of Adjusted Taxable Income for Purposes of Business Interest Deduction. Under pre-BBBA law, the deduction for business interest expense for a taxable year is generally limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s ""adjusted taxable income” (plus the taxpayer’s business interest income and “floor plan financing interest”) for the taxable year. “Adjusted taxable income” generally corresponds to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

The BBBA modifies the “adjusted taxable income” definition for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 so that it (1) is computed without taking into account deductions for depreciation, amortization, or depletion (which generally corresponds to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)) and (2) excludes global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) and income inclusions under IRC section 951(a) and IRC section 78 (and the portion of the deductions allowed under IRC sections 245A(a) (by reason of IRC section 964(e)(4)) and 250(a)(1)(B) by reason of such inclusions).

7. Renewal and Enhancement of Opportunity Zone Tax Benefits. Pre-BBBA law provides tax benefits for investments in qualified opportunity funds (“QOFs”), which generally are funds which invest in qualified opportunity zones. These tax benefits include temporary deferral of taxation of existing capital gains that are invested in a QOF, tax basis step-up, and exclusion of certain taxable gain ultimately realized on the QOF investment. These were set to expire at the end of 2026.

The BBBA provides for a second, permanent, round of QOFs beginning on January 1, 2027, with rolling ten-year qualified opportunity zone designations, subject to narrower eligibility requirements. The second round of QOFs would have similar but modified benefits, including temporary deferral of taxes on existing capital gains, tax basis step-up (including an increased basis step-up for investments in “qualified rural opportunity funds”) and exclusion of certain taxable gain ultimately realized on the QOF investment.

8. Expansion of Qualified Small Business Stock Gain Exclusion. Under pre-BBBA law, 100% of the gain from the sale of qualified small business stock (“QSBS”) by a noncorporate taxpayer is excluded from taxable income if certain conditions are satisfied, including that the QSBS was held for more than five years. A taxpayer’s QSBS exclusion for a taxable year with respect to a single corporate issuer is subject to a limit equal to the greater of (i) the remaining portion of a lifetime exclusion limit of $10 million ($5 million in the case of a separate return of a married individual) with respect to such corporate issuer and (ii) ten times the aggregate adjusted bases of QSBS issued by such corporate issuer and disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year. A corporation generally cannot qualify as a “qualified small business” when it issues stock if the corporation’s aggregate gross assets exceed $50 million at any time after 1993 through the moment immediately after the stock issuance.

The BBBA relaxes the holding period requirements that must be met in order for gain from QSBS to be excluded from taxable income. In particular, under the BBBA, 50% of the gain would be excluded for QSBS stock held at least three years, 75% for four years, and 100% for five years or more. The BBBA also increases the lifetime exclusion limit for QSBS gains from a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million (which is halved in the case of a separate return by a married individual) and raises the gross asset limit for a corporation to qualify as a ""qualified small business"" from $50 million to $75 million. Both thresholds are indexed for inflation beginning in 2027. These changes generally apply to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, with respect to QSBS issued or acquired after July 4, 2025.

9. Increase in Threshold for Requiring Information Reporting With Respect to Certain Payees. Under pre-BBBA law, the reporting threshold for payments by a business for services performed by an independent contractor or subcontractor and for certain other payments is generally $600.

The BBBA generally would increase the threshold to $2,000 for payments made after December 31, 2025, and adjust the threshold for inflation for calendar years after 2026.

10. Limitation on Individual Deductions for State and Local Taxes. Under pre-BBBA law, in the case of an individual, the itemized deduction for state and local taxes is capped at $10,000 ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) (the “SALT cap”) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026.

The BBBA increases the SALT cap to $40,000 ($20,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2030, subject to a phasedown in the case of taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income above specified thresholds (with the SALT cap not being reduced below $10,000, or $5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return). The BBBA also generally increases the SALT cap by 1% each year for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026, and before January 1, 2030. Finally, the BBBA provides for the SALT cap to permanently return to $10,000 ($5,000 for a married taxpayer filing a separate return) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2029. Notably, the BBBA does not include the provisions in prior versions of the bill which in some cases would have denied deductions for state and local taxes paid under pass-through entity tax, or “PTET”, regimes of states and localities.

11. Limitation on Excess Business Losses of Noncorporate Taxpayers. The BBBA makes permanent the limitations in effect under pre-BBBA law on deductions for “excess business losses” and continues to permit any excess business losses to be carried forward as NOLs in subsequent taxable years.

12. 1% Floor on Deduction of Charitable Contributions Made By Corporations. The BBBA limits the deduction of charitable contributions by corporations for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025 to only that portion of such contributions which exceeds 1% of the corporation’s taxable income for the taxable year. If such contributions exceed 10% of the corporation’s taxable income for the taxable year, then any charitable contribution deductions disallowed by the 1% floor generally can be carried forward for 5 taxable years.

13. Substantial Changes to Clean Energy Tax Incentives. The BBBA makes substantial changes to the clean energy tax credits enacted, extended and expanded as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. Please click here for a more detailed discussion of these BBBA provisions.

14. Payments from Partnerships to Partners for Property or Services. Under pre-BBBA law (IRC section 707(a)(2)), certain payments or transfers to partners from a partnership for property or services may be treated as transactions between the partnership and a non-partner “[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Secretary.” The BBBA makes IRC section 707(a)(2) self-effecting “[e]xcept as provided” by the Secretary for services performed by or property transfers to partners after July 4, 2025. The BBBA further provides that this change “shall [not] be construed to create any inference with respect to the proper treatment under section 707(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to payments from a partnership to a partner for services performed, or property transferred, on or before the date of the enactment of this Act.”

15. No Carried Interest Provisions. The BBBA does not include any provisions directly changing the taxation of carried interests.

16. Expansion of Publicly Traded Partnership Qualifying Income. The BBBA would expand the definition of “qualifying income” under IRC section 7704 for publicly traded partnerships to include certain income from an electricity generating facility that satisfies certain carbon capture requirements, as well as certain income from the production of electricity at certain nuclear facilities, the production of electricity or thermal energy from geothermal or hydropower facilities and the operation of geothermal or geothermal heat pump property, and would restore to “qualifying income” status the income from transportation or storage of two products that were inadvertently eliminated by TCJA.

INTERNATIONAL TAX PROVISIONS

Some of the key international tax provisions include the following:

1. Changes to FDII (now “FDDEI”) and GILTI (now “NCTI”) Rules. Under pre-BBBA law, a U.S. corporation was allowed a deduction equal to 37.5% of its foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and 50% of its inclusions with respect to GILTI. Each of FDII and GILTI were generally determined by reducing the income base by an amount equal to a deemed tangible income return of 10% (DTIR). The FDII and GILTI deductions were scheduled to be reduced to 21.875% and 37.5%, respectively, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA (1) renames the FDII and GILTI provisions as foreign-derived deduction eligible income (FDDEI) and net CFC tested income (NCTI), respectively, (2) eliminates the DTIR reduction utilized in determining a U.S. corporation’s FDII (now FDDEI) and a U.S. shareholder’s GILTI (now NCTI) inclusion, and (3) limits the allocation and apportionment of interest and other deductions to GILTI (now NCTI) for foreign tax credit purposes.

The BBBA also permanently sets the deduction amount for FDDEI and NCTI to 33.34% and 40%, respectively, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, resulting in effective tax rates of 14% and 12.6%, respectively. However, because the BBBA increases the allowed foreign tax credit for NCTI inclusions from 80% to 90% of foreign taxes, a local tax rate of 14% on NCTI is required to offset the effective U.S. tax rate of 12.6%.

2. Change in Base Erosion Minimum Tax (“BEAT”) Amount. Under pre-BBBA law, BEAT applies to corporations with annual gross receipts in excess of $500 million and base erosion payments above a certain threshold and imposes an additional tax to the extent that 10% of an applicable corporation’s modified taxable income exceeds its regular tax liability (reduced by certain specified tax credits). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, under pre-BBBA law, the 10% rate was scheduled to increase to 12.5% and the corporation’s regular tax liability would be reduced by all allowable credits (rather than just certain specified credits).

The BBBA permanently sets the BEAT rate at 10.5% and retains the pre-BBBA treatment of tax credits for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

3. Non-Enactment of Revenge Tax. The BBBA does not include the IRC section 899 “revenge tax” that was included in prior versions of the bill. Section 899 was removed from the bill in conjunction with the G7 countries announcing they will provide guidance on how the U.S. tax system and Pillar II will operate side-by-side in the coming months including to materially reduce compliance burdens for U.S. parented multinationals.

4. Section 954(c)(6) “Look Through Rule” Extension Made Permanent. The BBBA makes permanent the “look-through rule” in IRC section 954(c)(6) which exempts from foreign personal holding company of a controlled foreign corporation (“CFC”) income dividends, interest, rents, and royalties between related CFCs to the extent that such items are not attributable to subpart F income or income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business of the payor.

5. Limitations on Downward Attribution of Stock for CFC Purposes. The BBBA (1) restores the limitation on downward attribution of stock ownership from a foreign person to a U.S. person, former IRC section 958(b)(4), when applying the constructive ownership rules for purposes of the CFC rules, but (2) adds a new IRC section 951B to allow for downward attribution from a foreign person to a U.S. person in more limited cases involving foreign-controlled U.S. shareholders. These rules apply to tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2025.

6. Deferral Election Repealed. The BBBA repeals the IRC section 898 one-month deferral election for taxable years of specified foreign corporations beginning after November 30, 2025. The election previously permitted a CFC to elect a taxable year beginning one month earlier than its majority U.S. shareholder.

7. Subpart F Treatment of Partial Year CFCs and U.S. Shareholders. The BBBA provides that, if a foreign corporation is a CFC at any time during its tax year, each US shareholder that owns stock in that corporation during such tax year is required to include in gross income such shareholder’s pro rata share of the corporation’s subpart F income for the CFC year. Similar modified pro rata share rules would apply in the calculation of a US shareholder’s GILTI inclusion. This rule would apply to tax years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, 2025.

TAXATION OF INDIVIDUALS

Some of the other key provisions impacting individuals include the following:

The BBBA makes permanent the reduction in the individual income tax rates made by the TCJA.

The BBBA increases the estate and lifetime gift tax exemption amount to $15 million (plus the unused exclusion amount of a deceased spouse), indexed for inflation going forward, for estates of decedents dying and gifts made after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA makes permanent the increased individual alternative minimum tax exemption amounts and reverts the exemption phase-out thresholds to their original 2018 levels under the TCJA, while indexing them to inflation. Such exemption amounts and phase-out thresholds were otherwise set to expire for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

The BBBA makes permanent the elimination of deductions for miscellaneous itemized deductions made by the TCJA and which currently exists.

The BBBA reduces other itemized deductions of individual taxpayers who have taxable incomes in excess of the dollar amount at which the 37% rate bracket begins ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly in 2025). The reduction equals 2/37ths of the lesser of:

(1) such amount of itemized deductions; or

(2) so much of the taxable income of the taxpayer for the taxable year (determined without regard to this section and increased by such amount of itemized deductions) as exceeds the dollar amount at which the 37 percent rate bracket under section 1 begins with respect to the taxpayer.

This reduction applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Like solar and wind power, this energy is clean and renewable. But unlike solar and wind, it is also “firm”: available day in and day out, no matter the weather.

Geothermal is one of the few mature energy technologies (along with nuclear and hydroelectricity) that can offer firm power without producing climate-warming greenhouse gases. Although geothermal provides a tiny fraction of the world’s energy today, new technologies are swiftly expanding where and how we can harness the Earth’s heat.

The heat beneath our feet

The Earth’s core contains radioactive metals that constantly give off heat. Where this heat reaches the surface, it can fuel roiling hot springs or erupt in explosive geysers.

The first geothermal power plants were built on these natural sources of steam. Steam from hot springs turned a turbine to power a generator, just like in a coal-fired power plant.1

Modern geothermal plants find or make steam deeper underground. A pair of wells is drilled into the Earth, up to around 3 kilometers (nearly 2 miles) deep, where the rock is boiling hot.2 Water is pumped into the first well to seep into pores and cracks in the rock below. As the water heats up, it emerges from the second well and becomes steam that turns a turbine. Water can be continuously recycled through this system, making electricity all the while.

These power plants must be built on a very specific geology, with permeable rock and high heat near the Earth’s surface. This has mostly limited geothermal power to regions with lots of tectonic activity, like California, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Central America.

Widening the map

In small countries with rich underground heat, geothermal can be an important part of the power mix. Kenya gets almost half its electricity from geothermal,3 and Iceland uses geothermal for 30% of its electricity and nearly all its home heating.4 But globally, only around 0.3% of electricity comes from geothermal.5

Modern drilling technology is pushing these limits. As the cost of drilling falls, several countries have explored building geothermal power outside tectonically active areas, in places where the high heat needed lies deeper underground.

“Enhanced geothermal systems” (EGS) are also tapping heat from new kinds of rock formations. Engineers use horizontal drilling, pressurized water, and perforation guns to create fissures in rock that would otherwise be too solid for water to seep through. While only a few EGS plants are running today, projects in the western United States have broken records for how quickly EGS wells can be drilled—at costs that suggest geothermal energy could soon compete with coal, gas, wind, and solar across much of the world.6

Geothermal technologyDescriptionDry steam plant

The simplest type of geothermal power plant, a dry steam plant is built over the porous rock of a natural underground reservoir. Steam from this reservoir rises through a producer well.

This steam turns a turbine to make electricity. After making power, the steam passes through a condenser where it becomes liquid water. Finally, the cooled water is piped back underground through an injection well to be used again.

Flash steam plantIn a flash steam plant, the water piped from underground is under such high pressure that, even at super-hot temperatures, some or all of it remains liquid. The mix of water and steam that reaches the surface must pass through a low-pressure separator (or be “flashed”) to send a pure stream of steam to the turbine. Afterwards, the water is condensed and reinjected, just as in a dry steam plant.Binary cycle plantA binary cycle plant can make power from only moderately hot water. Instead of going to a turbine, the water passes through a heat exchanger. Here, it heats up a second fluid with a lower boiling point than water. It is this second fluid that becomes a vapor and turns a turbine to make power, in a self-contained loop that allows it to be recycled.Enhanced geothermal systems

An enhanced geothermal system accesses geothermal energy in places where the rock is not naturally permeable.

During the drilling process, high-pressure water is injected into the wells, fracturing the surrounding rock. As water seeps through these cracks, it absorbs the underground heat of the rock. The fractures also let water pass between the injection and producer wells, just as it would in a natural reservoir.

An enhanced geothermal system can use either flash steam or binary cycle technology.

Beyond electricity

Geothermal heat can be used for more than turning turbines. Boise, Idaho, which sits on a geothermally heated underground river, has been piping its naturally hot water into buildings to heat them for over 100 years.7 This kind of geothermal district heating is also found in cities like Izmir, Turkey; Munich, Germany; and most of Iceland. It can even use the same hot water that circulates in a geothermal power plant, providing heat and electricity together.

Geothermal energy is also used in paper mills, milk pasteurization, greenhouse farming, and other industries that need steam or moderate heat.

Geothermal heat pumps

Most geothermal technologies rely on deep drilling and rich underground reservoirs. But ground-source heat pumps, the most efficient way to heat and cool buildings today, can be built almost anywhere.

A heat pump acts like a sponge for heat, capturing it from one place and moving it to another. The best-known type of heat pump is an air conditioner, which soaks up heat from indoor air and pumps it outside. Reversible heat pumps can also warm buildings, by shuttling in heat from the outside. Because they move heat, rather than make heat, heat pumps are more energy efficient than natural gas or heating oil, create far less climate pollution, and in most American homes, also lower heating costs.8

Geothermal energy makes heat pumps even more efficient. A ground-source heat pump takes its heat not from the air, but from the earth. Pipes are drilled into the ground, to a depth where there are steady temperatures all year—typically around 50 °F (10 °C).9 A liquid circulates through these pipes, exchanging heat with the ground. In the winter, the system absorbs the ground’s heat and brings it inside; in the summer, it moves heat the other way.

Thanks to the constant moderate temperature, ground-source heat pumps are almost twice as efficient as air-to-air systems. Most importantly, they use only about 25% as much power when it really counts—during the coldest or hottest hours of the year. This is crucial, because if all homes are heated with electricity, power grids could be overwhelmed during these extreme weather hours. Many utilities and state agencies offer financial incentives to help people install ground-source heat pumps that put much less strain on the grid.

While geothermal heating is still rare, it is growing, especially in municipal buildings such as schools. Home systems are also becoming more common, helped by drilling and efficiency improvements that continue to boost performance and lower cost.

Geothermal in your neighborhood

Adding a ground-source heat pump to a building requires land, and installing it is costly.

As an alternative, some communities are putting in geothermal networks: a network of pipes with the holes drilled in convenient locations, to bring everyone in the area the benefits of ground-source heat pumps. These systems have been built on several college campuses around the United States, and utilities have started building them for entire neighborhoods, including in Boston, Massachusetts, Brooklyn, New York, and Washington, D.C.

Geothermal networks offer fairer access to this clean source of heat, while sharing the costs of drilling across many buildings. Today’s pilot projects will help show whether, and where, geothermal networks can provide heat as cheaply as natural gas, giving utilities a clean way to heat whole neighborhoods or cities when gas pipes reach the end of their useful life.

Evergy Kansas Central customers will see bills increase about 8.6% to build the new plants, KCC filings said.

EKC, the subsidiary of Evergy Inc. that serves Kansas customers, will be 50% co-owner of the two 710-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plants and 100% owner of the Kansas Sky solar facility, to be built in Douglas County. The Viola gas plant will be built in Sumner County, and the McNew gas plant will be in Reno County.

Cost of construction is estimated to be $788.75 million for the Viola plant and $800.52 million for the McNew plant, according to EKC’s filings. The solar field is expected to cost $228.1 million.

The other half of the two natural gas plants will be owned by Evergy Missouri West, but only if the Missouri Public Service Commission — KCC’s Missouri counterpart — approves the construction.

The Missouri commission’s staff has recommended against pre-construction approval because too many costs in the proposal were uncertain, according to Missouri Public Service Commission filings.

Rate concerns

The decision to build the natural gas plants was opposed by the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, industrial consumers and environmental groups, among others. In general, most agreed with building the solar plant, according to documents filed at KCC.

Commissioners also made note of their concerns about Evergy rates.

“The commission is concerned and troubled by the frequency and magnitude of rate cases, and strongly encourages Evergy to focus on pacing its proposed investments to better align those investments with actual load growth and the mitigation of large rate increases,” said Commissioner Dwight Keen at Monday’s virtual hearing.

Keen said that while the commission approves the addition of generation capabilities to meet the needs of Kansans and ensure stability of the power grid, they remain concerned about rate increases. Evergy currently has a separate rate case at KCC, asking for as much as a 15% hike to residential rates, which would be on top of the increase from building the plants.

Evergy last received a $41 million rate hike in 2023.

“The commission understands that from time to time, new investment in electric capacity is needed to support reliability and economic development in Kansas,” he said. “However, affordability and genuine maximum capacity needs must be major priorities and proactively pursued as Evergy addresses a seemingly endless list of ostensibly justifiable projects and initiatives.”

His words were matched by opponents to building the natural gas plants.

Opponents

Jim Zakoura, president of the Kansas Industrial Consumers Group, said Evergy has enough generation to meet electricity demand if current electricity systems, such as coal plants, are not retired before the end of their useful manufacturing life.

“Evergy’s plans to retire coal facilities early, while those facilities continue to provide electric service at costs which are far lower than new gas-fired generation, is not related to increased electric demand,” Zakoura said in a statement. “It is simply trading low-cost generation for high-cost generation to serve the same level of demand. Retail ratepayers get no greater value for their money — only higher prices.”

KCC staff and commissioners don’t agree.

“The oldest of the Jeffries units was commissioned in 1978 and will be over 50 years old if the proposed Viola combined cycle gas generation plant comes online in 2029,” Keen said. “It is impossible to know the exact timing of when coal units will retire. Load growth may require their lifespan to be extended, or environmental policy changes or technological advances may shorten their lives.”

Keen said an October 2022 fire at the Jeffrey Energy Center in Pottawatomie County caused that unit to be out of service for more than a year.

Officials with the Sierra Club, which testified in the Missouri Public Service Commission case for Evergy’s proposed plants and not in the Kansas case, said ratepayers are being asked to take on costs and subsidize a billion-dollar industry.

“Governor Kelly and KCC Commissioners supported and approved these gas plants, and now they have the opportunity to ensure that utilities and data centers pay their fair share, because the alleged new demand for electricity is from data centers, not Kansas families or existing businesses,” said Zack Pistora, director of the Kansas chapter.

Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, expressed concerns that natural gas prices are difficult to predict.

“I am really worried that we are going to push ourselves into a really risky position with fossil fuels,” she said. “I obviously am concerned about the climate impacts of adding fossil fuels, right? But secondarily, gas prices are so volatile. We saw that with Winter Storm Uri. It’s supply and demand.”

Winter Storm Uri brought arctic weather to the Midwest in February 2021, resulting in increased utility prices for most customers after natural gas prices shot high because of production problems and high usage.

Costs of natural gas are a “straight pass-through” from the utilities, she said. She referred to Empire District Electric, which in 2007 served southeast Kansas.

“They were heavily invested in gas and people couldn’t pay their bills,” Barnett said. “They were one of the first utilities that began to invest in wind in Kansas.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) risks erasing earnings from carbon credit sales. Also, Elon Musk’s recent political endorsement rattles investors, and Canada has frozen $40 million in aid over environmental concerns tied to Tesla’s projects.

Together, these developments supersede typical market volatility and signal a potential turning point. Let’s examine each of these instances and consider their impact on Tesla.

OBBB Bill Could Erase Billions in Carbon Credit Profits

In 2024, Tesla generated a record $2.76 billion by selling regulatory credits (carbon credits), which is nearly 39% of its net income ($7.09 billion) that year. These credits allowed other automakers—unable to meet emissions standards—to avoid penalties by purchasing Tesla’s excess credits. Over time, Tesla has earned more than $10 billion from credits since 2017.

However, the OBBB threatens to overturn this revenue stream. The bill removes clean energy and EV tax credits. This includes credits linked to emissions performance. It also ends federal penalties for vehicles that do not comply.

With this policy shift, analysts warn Tesla could lose as much as 80–90% of its U.S. carbon credit income, which could result in a loss of more than $2 billion in annual revenue.

RELATED: Tesla’s Carbon Credits Crash in Q1 2025: Earnings Drop and EV Sales Fall

Tesla aims to close this gap by boosting vehicle production and cutting costs. However, the electric vehicle (EV) industry faces challenges. Global EV sales hit 17 million units in 2024, and they could exceed 20 million in 2025. However, growth might slow down due to changes in policy.

The global EV market is now valued at $1.33 trillion. It is expected to grow to $6.5 trillion by 2030, showing a 32.5% annual growth rate. However, some analysts predict a more conservative growth rate of 14.5%, estimating it will reach around $1.66 trillion by 2030.

Investor Concern Mounts After Musk’s Political Endorsement

Tesla’s stock fell sharply in early July following Elon Musk’s public endorsement of a conservative politician. While credit sales had buoyed Tesla’s earnings, market analysts say that “more backlash could affect demand among politically sensitive consumers”.

Market experts also warned that this move could threaten TSLA’s value. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, noted:

“Very simply Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story.”

The stock dropped by ~15% since early 2025, partly due to OBBB concerns and Musk’s activism. Investors are now recalculating Tesla’s value without carbon credit income: P/E ratios may fall significantly.

Why Canada Hit Pause on $40M in Tesla Aid

This decision further comes from concerns about not consulting Indigenous groups and potential environmental risks. Canadian officials have tied funding release to Tesla’s compliance with strict environmental standards and local partnership agreements.

This move is more than financial; it signals stronger scrutiny of Tesla’s global operations. As Tesla plans new battery or vehicle manufacturing in Canada, this aid freeze raises potential execution risks and reputational exposure.

Global EV Landscape and Tesla’s Expanding Competition

Tesla, once the undisputed leader, is facing growing competition. China continues to dominate, accounting for two-thirds of EV sales and holding nearly 60% of global EV production.

Meanwhile, BYD overtook Tesla in global EV market share (16% vs. 14%). The Chinese carmaker continues to gain ground in international markets, including Europe and Southeast Asia.

Tesla’s competitive edge is being challenged not only by Chinese automakers but also by legacy carmakers. These include Volkswagen, Hyundai, and GM, which are accelerating their EV rollouts.

Hyundai-Kia, for example, now holds nearly 7% global EV share, and Volkswagen has committed to launching 30+ new EV models by 2030. Startups like Rivian and Lucid are also carving out niche segments.

Despite positive long-term trends, the U.S. EV market is slowing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its forecast for U.S. EV market share to 41% by 2030. This is a drop from nearly 50%. They point to fading subsidies and rising EV prices as reasons for this change.

BloombergNEF agreed, saying that policy uncertainties might slow EV adoption. This could affect over $150 billion in planned battery investments.

Can Tesla Weather the Storm?

Given the various challenges Tesla is facing, can it surpass all these and regain investors’ trust once again? Here are the top concerns to watch out for in the EV leader’s future.

1. Will vehicle sales make up for lost credit revenue?

Tesla needs to significantly boost sales. However, its 2024 deliveries — 1.78 million EVs — marked the first decline year-over-year. Its path forward relies on a balanced mix of new models (Cybercab, affordable versions) and global rollout, but competition and policy delays remain risks.

2. Does Musk’s political play threaten brand appeal?

CEO visibility impacts Tesla’s brand. With a growing political rift among its consumer base and investors, Tesla may lose market traction unless it separates its business strategy from divisive rhetoric.

3. Will Canada’s compliance push stall expansion?

The Canadian aid freeze sets a precedent. Grant applications, potential program abuse, environmental oversight, and community engagement would be crucial to Tesla’s growth plans.

4. Can diversification maintain growth?

Tesla’s energy and AI segments suggest diversification. Its Powerwall and Megapack storage deployments reached 16.7 GWh in 2024, and its Supercharger network now exceeds 65,000 stalls. Expanding charging infrastructure, AI vehicle updates, and energy offerings could partially offset credit and auto earnings gaps.

Tesla faces a mix of policy, political, and operational pressures. These challenges threaten its profits from carbon credits. While the company has built resilience through innovation in energy, AI, and scale, reversing or adapting to policy reversals will be critical.

Success depends on Tesla’s ability to grow in volume, cut costs, and expand globally. In the meantime, the OBBB, Musk’s spotlight, and Canada’s freeze combine to make this a critical moment for the EV pioneer’s future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2275471993.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 15:13:51.606317

As an additional benefit, household energy upgrades offer a particularly low-cost form of emissions abatement.
Recommendations Federal and state governments should commit to halve household energy bills over the next decade.","The rapid rise of abundant low-cost solar is driving Australian wholesale electricity costs to record low levels in the middle of the day. However, Australian households continue to see rising energy bills, due to factors including increasing coal and gas prices, outages at ageing power stations and network cost rises.

The policy debate on how to address rising energy costs has largely focused on the wrong solutions. This includes one-off power bill subsidies, and deliberation over whether to slow down the rollout of large-scale renewables in favour of alternatives (which more often than not would actually increase power prices).

These debates ignore the fact that energy bills are a product of not only the price of energy, but the amount of energy we consume. And reducing the energy that households consume from the grid (and using it more smartly) is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy costs.

Households that burn gas in their homes are wasting significant amounts of energy to meet their basic needs, as are those in poor thermally-performing homes, and those who rely on inefficient electric appliances.

Furthermore, while many Australian households now have rooftop solar, this can’t be put to its full potential when energy demand is concentrated in the evening, or met by burning gas.

This report presents the results of new IEEFA modelling, which finds that household energy upgrades including efficient electric appliances, rooftop solar and batteries could slash household energy bills by more than 90% in many regions.

These savings are based on a typical, representative household in each capital city. While each household’s situation and energy consumption patterns are different, the findings show that deep energy bill reductions can be enabled through household energy upgrades. These upgrades could form the core of a strategy to halve household energy bills.

Household energy upgrades also benefit other energy users, by cutting gas demand in constrained periods, and reducing peak electricity demand on the grid. This can result in lower generation costs and, in theory, lower network costs.

As an additional benefit, household energy upgrades offer a particularly low-cost form of emissions abatement. The upgrades modelled in this report would not only see overall energy consumption fall, but would shift electricity consumption to periods where solar is abundant, and the emissions intensity of electricity production is lowest.

In some regions such as Victoria, a poorly managed transition from gas to efficient electric appliances could result in a long-term increase in winter electricity demand. While shifting households off gas is highly beneficial in reducing expected gas supply gaps and greenhouse gas emissions, it also creates a need to consider how to manage peak demand in winter. Batteries, thermal shell upgrades and pre-heating are effective options to manage this.

Many household energy upgrades are highly cost-effective for households today – particularly where they are supported by federal or state rebates.

While residential batteries have longer payback periods than other upgrades, a combination of new federal rebates and expected future cost reductions will make them increasingly attractive. They will become even more cost-effective if their contributions to the grid during peak times are fairly valued.

Utilising the battery capacity in electric vehicles is a particularly significant untapped opportunity, if vehicle-to-home and vehicle-to-grid capabilities are unlocked via the right standards and regulations.

Homes with thermally efficient building shells offer the lowest running costs and the greatest opportunities to reduce peak demand. This includes through pre-heating and pre-cooling their home, which delivers some of the benefits of a battery at a fraction of the cost.

Despite the financial attractiveness of household energy upgrades, many households including renters or those on low incomes have no ability to undertake upgrades. Furthermore, even consumers who can invest in household energy upgrades are subject to “bounded rationality”

– a barrier that is often overlooked by energy efficiency policies.

Increasing minimum energy performance standards to encourage a shift from gas or inefficient electric appliances to efficient electric alternatives is a compelling solution. New legislation to phase out gas hot water systems in Victoria presents one example of an approach to achieve this, and there is an opportunity to reinvigorate the federal Equipment Energy Efficiency programme.

In the near term, financial incentives play a critical role to reduce the upfront cost hurdle for consumers and scale up the industry capacity to deliver upgrades. However, the current approach to incentives is piecemeal.

Victoria and New South Wales have implemented broad-based incentives for household energy upgrades, but there is a case for more comprehensive national versions of these schemes to be rolled out, which could be complemented with specific state government schemes where they would bring further benefits.

Pricing reform is not the sole solution, but it is nonetheless critical to ensure consumers have access to fair electricity plans that reward their contributions to the grid, without imposing unrealistic expectations on consumers to become energy traders.

Finally, household energy upgrades will have material consequences for gas and electricity distribution networks – potentially reducing the overall reliance on both networks, while presenting opportunities to use electricity distribution networks more efficiently.

This offers an opportunity to reduce network costs for consumers. However, a first-principles review of electricity network regulation is necessary to ensure those benefits can translate to better consumer outcomes.

Recommendations

Federal and state governments should commit to halve household energy bills over the next decade.

This should be based on a roadmap to roll out the technologies discussed in this report, accompanied by a policy pathway to deliver them.

Minimum energy performance standards should be expanded and increased to discourage installation of gas or inefficient electric appliances, and encourage installation of efficient and flexible electric appliances.

A comprehensive, national incentive scheme for energy upgrades should be implemented.

This could involve expanding the Victorian and/or New South Wales incentive schemes nation-wide, or by expanding and extending the federal Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme.

The scheme should support demand flexibility measures, extend beyond 2030, and consider the wide range of equitable funding approaches.

Fairer electricity pricing structures should be provided for consumers that offer reasonable rewards for efforts to reduce peak demand.

This should include improved tariffs, and well-designed, well-regulated Virtual Power Plants that support the interests of consumers and the grid. This should be considered as central to the Australian Energy Market Commission’s ongoing electricity pricing review.

A first-principles review of the economic regulation of gas and electricity networks should be undertaken.

This should be led by an independent panel with expertise in economic regulation, competition policy and consumer energy resources.

The review should re-evaluate the cost recovery approach for energy networks to fairly reflect the diminishing value of some assets (such as the gas distribution network asset base), while providing the right incentives to support wider uptake of consumer energy resources.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/aus-solar-shutterstock_1015544242.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 15:14:06.404808

The Executive Order shouldn’t come as a surprise. Last week, it was reported that House conservatives were assured by the Trump administration that it would crack down on renewable energy tax credits and projects in exchange for their vote.

Renewable energy companies face a crucial question: What comes next? Are renewable energy tax credits doomed? Will there be another reconciliation bill next year, and if so, will Congress attempt to delay the phase-out schedules for wind and solar projects? Will they seek to extend the “beginning of construction” language that barely made it into the last package?

Trump's sprawling domestic policy bill will bring major cuts to food assistance, Medicaid, student loans, and clean energy programs to offset the costs for tax cuts and other GOP priorities, including border security, defense, and deportation.

While some aspects of the law will take effect later this year, others won't be implemented until after midterm elections in 2026, The Hill reports.

One of the most contentious parts of the bill was reforms to Medicaid, the joint federal and state program that provides health insurance coverage to low-income Americans. By 2034, roughly 16 million people could lose their health insurance due to Medicaid cuts and changes to the Affordable Care Act, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

New work requirements also put Americans at risk of losing their coverage. Beginning no later than December 31, 2026, adults between the ages of 19 and 64 will be required to work at least 80 hours a month to qualify for Medicaid coverage barring certain exceptions.

Medicaid funding changes aren't scheduled to take effect until 2028.

Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" also adds new work requirements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the country’s largest food assistance program. The rules apply to most adults ages 19 to 64, with limited exemptions, including for parents with children under 14.

It's unclear when the new work requirements will take effect, but a spokesperson for the Senate Republicans said there's no ""delayed implementation in the law.""

Tax cuts that Trump enacted during his first term in 2017 are now permanent, effective immediately. Under the law, Americans living in high-tax states like New York and California will receive larger tax deductions for state and local taxes beginning this year.

The administration stated that the measure aims to support energy independence and fiscal responsibility by focusing on energy sources considered reliable and dispatchable. The White House characterized the removal of clean electricity production and investment tax credits as a response to what it called the 'Green New Scam.'

The Order outlines a policy change by instructing the Secretary of the Treasury to end clean energy incentives and strengthen restrictions on foreign entities considered potential national security risks. It also directs the Secretary of the Interior to revise regulations, removing preferential treatment for wind and solar energy and placing them on equal footing with fossil fuel resources, which the administration views as more reliable and cost-effective. This shift could impact the United States' energy landscape and the growth of the renewable energy sector.

Asserting the presidential commitment to ""unleashing American energy"" and preventing U.S. taxpayer dollars from supporting expensive, unreliable energy policies, the administration argues for the need to dismantle the fiscal burden of green subsidies. The White House believes that reliance on so-called ""green"" subsidies compromises ""America's electric grid"" and detracts from the country's landscape beauty, as well as potentially threatens national security by increasing dependency on foreign supply chains.

While the White House purports that ending these subsidies is crucial for energy dominance, national security, and economic growth, critics argue that the elimination of green incentives could derail the fight against climate change and compromise the burgeoning renewal energy sector.

Summary

Constellation Energy is uniquely positioned to benefit from the AI-driven data center boom, thanks to its dominant, zero-emission nuclear fleet and long-term PPAs.

The pending Calpine acquisition will make Constellation the largest independent US power producer, diversifying its portfolio, and boosting EPS and free cash flow.

Premium valuation is justified by unmatched revenue visibility, downside protection from nuclear PTCs, and exclusive, multi-decade contracts with hyperscalers, like Microsoft and Meta.

I reiterate a Strong Buy rating, with a $380-385 target, seeing 25% upside, as the market underappreciates Constellation’s growth, stability, and irreplicable competitive moat.

Why Constellation Is the Holy Grail of Energy for the AI ​​Age

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-08 18:13:48+00:00,Evergreen Action,Here's How Republicans' New Federal Budget Affects You | Evergreen Action,Not Available,,,,,https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/heres-how-republicans-new-federal-budget-affects-you,"Here’s what you need to know about how it will affect your energy costs, home affordability and efficiency, clean energy jobs, and climate pollution.
Families living below the poverty line already spend anywhere between one-sixth to over one-fourth of their income on their energy bills.
Tax credits created under the Biden-Harris administration, which ranged up to $7,500, are now being eliminated by Congressional Republicans on September 30, 2025.
Prioritizing individual greed, MAGA loyalty, and oil exec donors over their own constituents, Republicans cut popular, effective climate and clean energy tax credits in the budget.
The very same investments that led to billions of dollars in clean energy spending and jobs that overwhelmingly flowed into their districts.","There will be thousands of unnecessary deaths every year in exchange for billions of dollars of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Billionaires and Big Oil CEOs funded Trump’s election, bought access to him and his MAGA sheep, and now are exploiting the public for their profit.

The GOP’s budget will impact all of us. Republican lawmakers knew how bad it was, and voted for it anyway. Now, they are counting on the fact that most Americans haven’t read the text closely enough to notice who is at fault (Trump and the GOP) and what is on the chopping block (nearly everything the rest of us care about).

That’s why we compiled answers to some common questions about Trump’s big, bad budget bill. Here’s what you need to know about how it will affect your energy costs, home affordability and efficiency, clean energy jobs, and climate pollution.

Congressional Republicans decided to get rid of energy sources, not add to them. And that will raise your bills, not lower them. Not only did they decide to minimize the supply of energy, but they are also cutting the fastest-growing and most affordable energy sources—renewables, like solar and wind.

The GOP budget rapidly phases out tax credits for wind and solar, which will make the grid less reliable by cutting back 50 percent of new clean energy capacity over the next decade. This is all at a time when artificial intelligence and data centers are demanding more energy.

Biden-era provisions, now cut by the GOP spending plan, were making it more affordable for families to install solar panels to lower utility bills. Those provisions helped families pay their bills, and brought down the overall cost of energy. Trump’s budget also cut building energy efficiency credits, which have collectively helped millions of Americans reduce their monthly energy bills $1,250 each year, while creating a quarter-million jobs.

Instead, the GOP budget is projected to:

Increase wholesale electricity prices by 25 percent by 2030 and 74 percent by 2035

Cause electricity rates for customers to increase between 9-18 percent by 2035

Increase overall household energy costs by $170 annually by 2035

Eliminate 760,000 jobs by 2030

These changes will harm low-income households the most. Families living below the poverty line already spend anywhere between one-sixth to over one-fourth of their income on their energy bills. With Republicans cutting off the last of the fraying threads of our social safety net, families who were already making impossible decisions between heating and eating will be further crunched to make ends meet.

If you want to work on a home improvement project to make your home more energy-efficient and healthier, and receive a tax write-off for it, your project would need to finish by the end of this year, thanks to GOP lawmakers. The new budget eliminates credits for installing solar panels, water heating, and heat pumps. It also eliminates a $1,200 credit for weatherization and insulation to make your home less drafty and more resilient to weather events and wildfires.

To access energy-efficient home and commercial building incentives, developers would have to start construction by June 30, 2026. This is the same credit that supported the construction of nearly 350,000 efficient new homes in 2024 (PDF) and cut homeowner energy bills by about $450 per year.

All together, Trump’s megabill will make it more expensive to make important home upgrades to heating, lighting, hot water systems, insulation, and home resilience. That not only means higher energy bills and a home that is built to decades-old standards now, but also lowers the value of your home if you decide to rent or sell it in the future. In a time where extreme weather events like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods are becoming all too common, the GOP is making it harder for residents to keep themselves and their homes safe.

On top of this, the GOP bill will add trillions of dollars to the federal debt, which risks raising already elevated interest rates. Higher interest rates will make it more expensive for people to finance their purchase of a home. Couple that with the fact that climate inaction is also fueling rising insurance costs, and the cost of homeownership could become more expensive, less safe, and more difficult for everyday Americans.

The Trump administration’s actions add literal fuel to this fire by intensifying the climate crisis, driving up pollution, and cutting off funds from FEMA and other agencies and programs that support resiliency.

Interested in buying an EV? It’s about to get a lot more expensive. Tax credits created under the Biden-Harris administration, which ranged up to $7,500, are now being eliminated by Congressional Republicans on September 30, 2025. GOP lawmakers also put an end to tax credits for commercial clean vehicles and fueling infrastructure, which support U.S.-based industry, cut pollution, and create jobs.

Many states and businesses have experienced a manufacturing boom, specifically in electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar energy, and their supply chains, thanks to a credit (45X) that is now being phased out by the GOP budget.

Investing in electric vehicles, industry, and charging networks translates into consumer savings at the pump, high-quality U.S.-based jobs, and cleaner air for communities that have faced deadly air pollution for far too long. But this progress is all being brought to a screeching halt by the GOP spending plan, undermining $200 billion in new investment. Driven by Trump’s EV vendetta, the U.S. will effectively cede the American auto industry to overseas competitors (specifically China), make it harder for people to afford used or new EVs, and drive up pollution across the country.

Republicans Voted for a Bill They Knew Was Bad

Congressional Republicans knew the budget would enrich Big Oil CEOs and billionaires, undermine growing American industries, rip healthcare away from millions of Americans, and raise our electricity bills. But they voted for it anyway.

They voted for policies that are unpopular across party lines, and for a budget bill that is not in the interest or the wishes of the vast majority of Americans. But look at the numbers, and it’s plain to see who Trump and the GOP designed this budget for.

We are looking at the largest wealth transfer from working-class people to the ultra-wealthy in history. Projections suggest that:

The lowest-earning Americans, those earning less than $16,999, would lose about $820 a year—or a 5.7 percent reduction in median income

The richest 0.1 percent, earning more than $4.3 million, would gain a whopping $390,000, or the equivalent of five median household incomes combined

Despite cutting essential funds from healthcare, clean energy, and food assistance, the deficit is expected to balloon to an eye-popping $3.3 trillion within a decade, thanks to all the giveaways to the ultra-wealthy.

The GOP Chose Greed and Loyalty to Trump Over Their Constituents, Jobs, and the Economy

In what is practically a Disney movie cast of villains, fossil fuel industry trade associations, including the National Mining Association, American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, and the American Petroleum Institute, all praised this budget. It should come as no surprise: Linked arm-in-arm with bought-out Republicans, the oil and gas industry represents a handful of the few that stand to benefit from the new spending plan. They will receive an estimated $18 billion in handouts in the coming decade (PDF), lower royalty rates, and expanded drilling access to treasured places.

Prioritizing individual greed, MAGA loyalty, and oil exec donors over their own constituents, Republicans cut popular, effective climate and clean energy tax credits in the budget. The very same investments that led to billions of dollars in clean energy spending and jobs that overwhelmingly flowed into their districts.

Only a handful of Republicans put up a half-hearted effort to save portions of these investments, and in the end, nearly all of them ended up sacrificing their voters and the broader public by voting for the bill.",https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/og-image/one-big-beautiful-bill-follow-up-blog-hero-og.jpg?1751996083,N,,2025-07-08 15:14:02.287465

The Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that Gutierrez did not have standing to sue because the courts could not provide him with a remedy.
The brief states that it is now ""undeniable"" that the district court may hear the case.","A group of young climate activists seeking to revive their lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) argued in a new court filing that a legal opinion by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito bolsters their right to proceed in court.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs cite a dissenting opinion by Alito filed last year, challenging the Court's decision not to hear a case about whether a Wisconsin school district is legally allowed to conceal a student's gender identity from their parents.

""Some federal courts are succumbing to the temptation to use the doctrine of Article III standing as a way of avoiding some particularly contentious constitutional questions,"" Alito wrote.

Why It Matters

Genesis B. v. EPA is one of several cases of environmental litigation involving youth plaintiffs as the debate over United States climate policy continues. The outcome could impact both how courts handle youth-led constitutional climate claims and the EPA's regulatory reach.

The activists' efforts come as federal courts, including the Supreme Court, have increasingly weighed the scope and limits of agency authority over environmental matters.

What to Know

Attorneys for the 18 plaintiffs involved in Genesis B. v. EPA filed their opening brief on July 2, 2025, with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. They called on the court to overturn a previous district court ruling that dismissed their case on the grounds that they lacked standing to sue.

The plaintiffs claim the EPA discriminates against children by undervaluing the long-term benefits of pollution regulations, and that recent Supreme Court precedent strengthens their argument that federal courts have the authority to hear their claims.

U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald first dismissed the lawsuit in May 2024, but allowed the plaintiffs to submit an amended complaint. Fitzgerald cited the plaintiffs' failure to demonstrate how a favorable court ruling would redress their alleged injuries.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs refer to two Supreme Court rulings decided after the lower court's order. In Diamond Alternative Energy v. EPA, the Court ruled that a lower court had improperly blocked a challenge to an EPA waiver that allowed California to set more stringent car pollution rules.

In that case, the Court said that a decline in gasoline sales could hurt fuel producers and that ""those monetary costs 'are of course an injury.'""

The second recent case cited by plaintiffs is Gutierrez v. Saenz, a case that dealt with a death-row inmate's right to challenge state laws on DNA testing.

The Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that Gutierrez did not have standing to sue because the courts could not provide him with a remedy. The plaintiffs in Genesis B. v. EPA argued that this shows ""they are not required to prove that a favorable decision would result in different regulatory outcomes.""

The brief states that it is now ""undeniable"" that the district court may hear the case.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs said that, if their claims are upheld, the courts possess the power to ""redress their unequal treatment and ensuing constitutional injuries.""

Youth-led climate litigation has gained attention in recent years, with notable wins in state courts.

For example, in 2023, young plaintiffs in Montana succeeded in obtaining a ruling that climate impacts must be considered before issuing permits for fossil fuel projects. In June, Hawaii agreed to a settlement with young people to decarbonize its transportation system by 2045.

What People Are Saying:

Attorneys for the plaintiffs, in a brief: ""The district court erred in denying Plaintiffs standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief for Defendants' unequal treatment and resulting economic, physical, and mental health harms these constitutional violations cause Plaintiffs personally.""

U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald, in a February order: ""Plaintiffs failed to present the Court with any authority for the proposition that dealing with a societal problem—albeit one of great magnitude—for a longer period of time transforms a generalized grievance into a particularized harm.""

What Happens Next

The federal government is expected to file its own brief in the case by August 4.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2679038/justice-samuel-alito.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:14:02.669499

The truck doesn't include things like built-in infotainment, but its lower price tag is drawing notice.

The first question Lauren Gregory’s 7-year-old son, James, had about the Slate pickup parked inside the MOTO gathering space in Ferndale, Michigan, spoke volumes about what the electric truck is not.

“He said when he got in, ‘Where’s the TVs?’” Gregory said, standing beside the truck as intrigued guests filtered through the room. “It’s very simple on the inside.”

The truck, the creation of a Jeff Bezos-backed electric vehicle startup with an office in Troy, Michigan, is not a typical pickup.

The version shown on June 29 was a prototype, so not ready for production, but the model potential customers hope to see next year won’t include many of the accoutrements — infotainment systems being a notable absence — that modern-day car buyers have come to expect. Those additions, the folks at Slate noted, also help drive up the cost of new cars, a key gripe of many consumers and something that this vehicle is designed to address, with a price tag expected to be in the mid-$20,000s.

Gregory, 41, of Beverly Hills, unlike some other folks who spoke to a Free Press reporter — part of the USA TODAY Network — has not placed a $50 refundable reservation for the truck, but she indicated she’s intrigued because it’s billed as highly customizable. In fact, the vehicles would start as two-seater trucks but offer kits to transform them, with seating for five possible. The options include a squareback or fastback SUV, open air or cargo.

Gregory said her son “loves the idea it’s a Mr. Potato Head,” one of the best-known customizable children’s toys.

Some consumers, she noted, might find the hand-cranked windows to be “non-negotiable,” but not Gregory.

“I feel like everything’s done for us these days,” she said, noting that a hand-cranked window would be “perfectly fine.”

That was the assessment from a number of folks, remembering with some nostalgia the cars of past eras before electronics took over. One man sounded genuinely surprised that the crank actually worked on this model.

Craig Woods, 65, of Allendale, near Grand Rapids, drove from western Michigan specifically to see and touch the two-seater truck. It reminded Woods of his old Ford Ranger, a smaller truck than the version on the roads today.

“I was always looking for a small pickup,” not “beastly” like other available models, Woods said. “Overall, the vehicle looks like it’s going to be a good, solid, entry-level EV.”

Woods, who put in his $50 reservation a couple of months ago, drives a Kia Soul with a trailer to handle his towing needs currently. If he’s able to purchase a Slate, it would be his first EV, hitting a price point that makes going electric attractive.

Woods said he wants to do his part for the environment, but even beyond that, he said he believes EVs represent the future direction of transportation.

The rear-wheel-drive Slate will offer two battery options, of up to 150 miles or 240 miles of range. The vehicles will be built in Warsaw, Indiana, and Slate said it intends to sell directly to consumers.

The truck is expected to have a towing capacity of 1,000 pounds, with a cargo bed that’s 35.1 cubic feet and 5 feet long. The frunk (where the engine would normally sit in non-electric vehicles) is 7 cubic feet, according to the company.

The vehicles will come in a basic gray, with color customization through wraps. The company said it will have wrap kits starting at about $500.

The model on display on Sunday had a blue wrap with orangish-yellow striping along the lower sides, with a couple of palm tree silhouettes.

Derek Ochodnicky, 38, of Berkley would probably be OK with the stock color (he loves gray). Michigan winters had him wondering about the longevity of a wrap.

He’d brought his daughter, 2-year-old Dani, along to see the Slate. She loves cars, he noted. Ochodnicky, who likes to “mod cars,” indicated he’d be looking at the SUV option, as a two-seater “probably won’t cut it” with Dani and an expected future sibling.

If the price is in the $20,000-$25,000 range, that would appeal to him.

Ochodnicky wasn’t sold, however, on the exposed bolts on the sides of the vehicle, a possible invitation he thought for a passerby with nefarious plans. He said he’d be “interested to see what the fit and finish is when it reaches production.”

A Slate agent on site, Kylee Flake, indicated that the bolts would remain visible.

Ochodnicky did note the conundrum that some buyers may face.

“Part of me” wants the back-to-basics vehicle, but Ochodnicky said he also likes his creature comforts.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/29/PDTF/84409885007-img-8720.jpg?crop=4031,2268,x0,y302&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-08 15:14:36.815942

Previously, developers could claim a 30% tax credit through 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The industry fears that limiting access to safe harbor rules will disrupt project financing and development timelines, especially for large-scale utility solar.
With the 2026 sunset looming, clean energy developers now face a compressed timeline — and a more hostile policy environment — to bring projects to fruition.
The battle over America’s energy future is far from over, but this executive order is a defining marker in the shifting political winds.","In a move that marks a dramatic departure from the pro-renewables policies of the past decade, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed squarely at dismantling federal support for wind and solar energy projects.

The directive, issued on July 7, accelerates the phase-out of clean energy tax credits and calls for the elimination of what the administration describes as “market-distorting subsidies” for “unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources.”

The executive order builds on the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which terminates federal production and investment tax credits (PTC and ITC) for new wind and solar projects unless they begin construction before 2026 and come online by 2027. Previously, developers could claim a 30% tax credit through 2032 under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Tightening the Safe Harbor Window

Trump’s order instructs the Treasury Department to strictly enforce and redefine what qualifies as “beginning construction” — a critical eligibility milestone for claiming the PTC and ITC.

Specifically, the order seeks to restrict the use of “broad safe harbors” that allowed developers to qualify simply by spending 5% of project costs or initiating preliminary construction work.

Treasury is directed to issue updated guidance within 45 days, including measures to prevent what the administration calls the “artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility.” Additionally, the department must implement new rules around Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions — a provision aimed at reducing reliance on solar panels and components sourced from countries like China.

Interior Department Ordered to End “Preferential Treatment”

The executive order also tasks the Department of the Interior with reviewing and revising any policies that may provide favorable treatment to wind and solar projects over so-called “dispatchable” energy sources like coal, gas, and nuclear.

The review covers all regulations and land-use decisions under the department’s jurisdiction, particularly those involving public lands leased for renewable energy development.

Both agencies are required to submit implementation reports to the White House by mid-August.

Industry Reaction

Clean energy advocates and developers swiftly condemned the move.

Abby Hopper, President and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), said the order introduces “uncertainty and instability” into a sector responsible for most of the new electricity generation capacity in the U.S. “Business certainty and predictability are foundational to investment,” she said.

The industry fears that limiting access to safe harbor rules will disrupt project financing and development timelines, especially for large-scale utility solar. Legal analysts expect the EO to face challenges in court, especially around its interpretation of statutory tax provisions.

What’s at Stake

“The battle over America’s energy future is far from over, but this executive order is a defining marker in the shifting political winds.”

Renewable energy advocates argue the executive order undermines years of bipartisan progress toward grid modernization and emissions reductions. At a time when solar and wind are the cheapest sources of new electricity in much of the U.S., the move could stall momentum in one of the fastest-growing job sectors.

Trump’s message is clear: he’s betting on fossil fuels, domestic energy dominance, and a rollback of climate-forward policies. With the 2026 sunset looming, clean energy developers now face a compressed timeline — and a more hostile policy environment — to bring projects to fruition.

Senate Bill 266, “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” did not receive Stein’s Hancock on July 2. If passed, it would eliminate the 2030 carbon emissions reduction target, reallocate power costs to residents, and adjust utility cost recovery rules.

Proponents, including Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger and Duke Energy, claimed the bill would save ratepayers billions and ensure reliability. Opponents, including Stein, countered it will raise residential bills, increase reliance on natural gas, and hinder clean energy goals.

S.B. 266 began as a bill concerning floodplain home rebuilding, but its focus shifted in early June. Union County Rep. Dean Arp (R) championed amending it into its current form, which passed in Republican favor in both the House, 75-36, and Senate, 29-11, in June. It was sponsored by Senator Warren Daniel (R-Buncombe), who was reelected in the 2024 cycle and received a $7,000 contribution from the Duke Energy Corporate PAC; Arp also received $12,800 from the PAC.

Stein wrote in his veto statement that the summer heat and rising utility bills should be refocused to “lowering electricity costs for working families — not raising them.”

North Carolina Justice Center’s senior policy advocate Claire Williamson “applauded” the veto. The center’s nonprofit is dedicated to eliminating poverty and advancing economic justice for North Carolinians. Williamson said the bill would benefit Duke, while affecting low-income households already struggling to afford the “basic necessity of heating and cooling their homes.”

New Hanover Rep. Deb Butler (D), who previously voted against the bill’s passage in the House, told Port City Daily she is “grateful” for the governor’s veto.

“Senate Bill 266 in my estimation is very bad for many reasons, not the least of which would be a likely increase for anyone who pays a Duke power electric bill,” Butler said. “In short, it’s bad for Duke customers and bad for the environment so I am grateful that our governor vetoed it and I will certainly support his veto.”

In defense of the veto, Stein referred to an analysis by EQ Research for the Environmental Defense Fund, which found the Senate bill would shift about $87 million each year in purchased power costs from businesses to homes. This could lead to a 19% jump in that specific charge for households.

Separately, public staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission projected a more conservative shift of approximately $24.8 million annually to Duke’s residential customers, translating to roughly $6.71 to $7.89 more per year.

NCUC projected the bill’s passing could bring in a total of $13 billion in savings, though legislative leaders, such as Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger, have publicly “estimated $15 billion.”

Proponents also assert that removing the 2030 carbon reduction deadline allows energy companies like Duke to pursue a more diversified energy mix, including sustained reliance on natural gas and investments in major nuclear power plants. They argue natural gas and nuclear energy are more cost-effective and reliable in the long run than rapidly scaling up renewables.

The reduction goals for carbon dioxide emissions from North Carolina power plants — a 70% decrease from 2005 levels by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2050 — were established by House Bill 951, “Energy Solutions for North Carolina.” It was signed into law by former Gov. Roy Cooper in October 2021. This “net-zero” goal mostly focuses on the electricity sector, aiming to transition away from fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas, and toward cleaner energy sources like solar and wind.

“As our state continues to grow, we need to diversify our energy portfolio so that we are not overly reliant on natural gas and its volatile fuel markets,” Stein wrote in his veto statement.

Duke Energy argues delaying the 2030 emissions target allows for a more cost-effective transition, saving billions by avoiding rapid, expensive investments in new clean energy infrastructure. This means utilizing existing natural gas plants longer and awaiting cheaper future technologies, spreading costs over more years for ratepayers.

A Duke spokesperson asserted in a statement: “Policies enabling more timely recovery of investments in modern infrastructure, like always-on nuclear power plants, help keep overall costs down for customers and result in more predictable energy prices by avoiding sudden spikes.”

On November 1, 2024, North Carolina Utilities Commission granted Duke an extension on the 2030 emissions target, agreeing achieving the 70% reduction by 2030 was not feasible while ensuring a consistent and uninterrupted power supply for customers. Duke’s own projections show compliance with the emissions target by 2035.

An independent analysis of S.B. 266 from researchers at N.C. State University revealed removing the 2030 carbon emissions reduction target could lead to a $23 billion increase in fuel costs through 2050, primarily due to a heavier reliance on natural gas with volatile market prices. The researchers claimed while delaying immediate infrastructure costs might be beneficial in the short-term, the long-term risk of fluctuating and potentially higher fossil fuel prices could negate any claimed savings and raise prices for North Carolinians.

Williamson told Port City Daily she has gotten more calls this year from ratepayers who are concerned about increases in their energy bills, who often attribute it to renewable energy.

“There is a misconception that renewables are what is driving rate increases, when in fact, the majority of the rate increases that have happened recently are because of natural gas spikes,” Williamson said.

The Environmental Defense Fund research found natural gas fuel costs accounted for between 46% and 67% of Duke Energy’s residential retail rate increases since 2017 in its North Carolina territories. Unlike fossil fuels, the costs of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are not subject to the same market volatility, as their “fuel” (sunlight and wind) is free.

Williamson pointed out the bill also would have allowed Duke to charge ratepayers for costs associated with construction works-in-progress. Essentially, customers would pay for the financing of large-scale projects, such as natural gas or nuclear facilities, while they are still being built and before they are operational.

“What the proponents of this miss is they’re exposing ratepayers to much greater risk, should something not go right,” Williamson said.

With ratepayers forking out money for power plant projects before and during construction, they’re also on the hook for variables. Williamson said this could include changes in construction costs, natural gas prices or pollution controls impacting whether energy infrastructure projects are completed on time or to the level they should be.

“We’re talking about 10 to 15 years of projects here that could change once it’s been put in motion,” Williamson said. “There’s no chance for ratepayers to get that money back, versus the previous model, which is saying ratepayers are going to only pay for something once it’s useful. This is a chunk of change that ratepayers could pay for and get nothing in return.”

To override Stein’s veto of S.B. 266, a three-fifths majority of the members present and voting in each chamber is required. The General Assembly’s capacity to override Stein’s veto of SB 266 is split: Republicans command a supermajority in the Senate (30-20), but lack one vote in the House (71-49), meaning they will need at least one Democratic vote in the House to succeed.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-08 18:01:52+00:00,Canary Media,A heat wave hit New England's grid. Clean energy saved the day. - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/northeast-heat-wave-solar-battery-benefits,"“Local solar, energy efficiency, and other clean energy resources helped make the power grid more reliable and more affordable for consumers,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of clean energy and climate programs at the Acadia Center, a regional nonprofit that analyzed clean energy’s financial benefits during the recent heat wave.
“Green Mountain Power has proven that by making these upfront investments in batteries, you can save ratepayers money,” said Peter Sterling, executive director of trade association Renewable Energy Vermont.
In Vermont, Green Mountain Power’s virtual power plant is its largest dispatchable resource, spokesperson Kristin Carlson said.
The 72-MW system includes batteries from 5,000 customers, electric school bus batteries, and a mobile, utility-scale battery on wheels.
By pulling power from batteries rather than just the grid, Green Mountain Power lowered its part of the peak.","As temperatures across New England soared above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in recent weeks, solar panels and batteries helped keep air conditioners running while reducing fossil-fuel generation and likely saving consumers more than $20 million.

“Local solar, energy efficiency, and other clean energy resources helped make the power grid more reliable and more affordable for consumers,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of clean energy and climate programs at the Acadia Center, a regional nonprofit that analyzed clean energy’s financial benefits during the recent heat wave.

On June 24, as temperatures in the Northeast hit their highest levels so far this year, demand on the New England grid approached maximum capacity, climbing even higher than forecast. Then, unexpected outages at power plants reduced available generation by more than 1 gigawatt. As pressure increased, grid operator ISO New England made sure the power kept flowing by reducing exports to other regions, arranging for imports from neighboring areas, and tapping into reserve resources.

At the same time, rooftop and other ​“behind-the-meter” solar panels throughout the region, plus Vermont’s network of thousands of batteries, supplied several gigawatts of needed power, reducing demand on an already-strained system and saving customers millions of dollars. It was a demonstration, supporters say, of the way clean energy and battery storage can make the grid less carbon-intensive and more resilient, adaptable, and affordable as climate change drives increased extreme weather events.

“As we see more extremes, the region still will need to pursue an even more robust and diverse fleet of clean energy resources,” Dickerson said. ​“The power grid was not built for climate change.”

On June 24, behind-the-meter solar made up as much as 22% of the power being used in New England at any given time, according to the Acadia Center. At 3:40 p.m., total demand peaked at 28.5 GW, of which 4.4 GW was met by solar installed by homeowners, businesses, and other institutions.

As wholesale power prices surpassed $1,000 per megawatt-hour, this avoided consumption from the grid saved consumers at least $8.2 million, according to the Acadia Center.

This estimate, however, is conservative, Dickerson said. He and his colleagues also did a more rigorous analysis accounting for the fact that solar suppresses wholesale energy prices by reducing overall demand on the system. By these calculations, the true savings for consumers actually topped $19 million, and even that seems low, Dickerson said.

In Vermont, the state’s largest utility also relieved some of the pressure on the grid by deploying its widespread network of residential and EV batteries. That could save its customers some $3 million by eliminating the utility’s need to buy expensive power from the grid and reducing fees tied to peak demand.

“Green Mountain Power has proven that by making these upfront investments in batteries, you can save ratepayers money,” said Peter Sterling, executive director of trade association Renewable Energy Vermont. ​“It’s something I think is replicable by other utilities in the country.”

Green Mountain Power’s system of thousands of batteries is what is often called a ​“virtual power plant” — a collection of geographically distributed resources like residential batteries, electric vehicles, solar panels, and wind turbines that can work together to supply power to the grid and or reduce demand. In Vermont, Green Mountain Power’s virtual power plant is its largest dispatchable resource, spokesperson Kristin Carlson said. The 72-MW system includes batteries from 5,000 customers, electric school bus batteries, and a mobile, utility-scale battery on wheels.

The network began in 2015 with the construction of a 3.4-megawatt-hour storage facility at a solar field in Rutland, Vermont. Two years later, the utility launched a modest pilot program offering Tesla’s Powerwall batteries to 20 customers, followed in 2018 by a pilot that paid customers to share their battery capacity during high-demand times. In 2022, a partnership with South Burlington’s school district linked electric school buses to the system, and in 2023, state regulators lifted an annual cap on new enrollments it had imposed on a Green Mountain Power program that leases batteries to households. The number of customers with home batteries has since grown by 72%.

“We’ve had a really dramatic expansion,” Carlson said. ​“It is growing by leaps and bounds.”

The network saved consumers money during the heat wave by avoiding the need to buy power at the high prices the market reached that day, but also by helping to lower the ​“capacity fees” charged by ISO New England. These charges are determined by the one hour of highest demand on the grid all year, and then allocated to each utility based on their contributions to that peak. By pulling power from batteries rather than just the grid, Green Mountain Power lowered its part of the peak.

If the afternoon of June 24 remains the time of peak demand for 2025, Green Mountain Power’s 275,000 customers will save about $3 million in total and avoided power purchases, the utility calculated. Looking ahead, more hot weather and further expansion of the utility’s virtual power plant will likely continue to put money back in customers’ pockets, Sterling said: ​“When you play that out over many years, that’s real savings to ratepayers.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1233596893.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ddcaf532759e01b7e3f904271b08ba71,N,,2025-07-08 14:20:18.169081

That particular Ford EV plant – which has also drawn the ire of a group of local citizens – was slated to move forward regardless, and begin building lithium-iron phosphate batteries for future Ford EVs starting in 2026. Now, it seems as if Ford may receive those federal production tax credits, after all, even after a newly passed budget bill seemed destined to phase them out.

According to the Detroit Free Press, The Blue Oval has announced that its under-construction Ford EV plant is on track to qualify for the production tax credit. A previous House version of the budget bill aimed to eliminate these production tax credits for plants that used components or licensed technology from China, which seemingly put Ford at risk, given that it’s going to build LFP batteries in Michigan using technology licensed from China-based CATL. However, the final Senate-drafted version adds criteria regarding which party is in “effective control,” which in this case is indeed Ford, as it owns the site, equipment, and workers, and it won’t use Chinese raw materials.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” the company said in a statement. “BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit – a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

Thus far, Ford has invested $3 billion into BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, which will employ 1,700 people and is slated to feature an annual output of 20 gigawatt hours when it begins production in 2026 – a bit scaled back compared to its original plan, a decision that was made amid softer demand for EVs. As for what vehicles will utilize the LFP batteries set to be built at the future site, one of them is expected to be the first model riding on Ford’s new low-cost EV platform, a mid-size pickup.

Packed within the host of small touches Bentley brings to the EXP 15 concept, there are cues that will ultimately make it to the brand’s first production EV.","Bentley is showing off its design vision for future vehicles, starting with its first EV set to debut next year.

Even with automakers paring back full electrification plans over the coming years, luxury marques like Bentley are still keeping an eye toward the future. It is still keeping its hybridized V8 offerings around for awhile, despite discontinuing the long-running W12 from its lineup, while this EXP 15 concept is meant to show what Bentley’s next era will look like — and it’s certainly different to what we’ve known the brand to be over the decades.

In fact, Bentley brought out a 1930 Speed Six Gurney Nutting Sportsman coupe, called the “Blue Train”, to prove just that point. The company’s designers took inspiration from its century-long heritage, and you can see that in the long hoodline and low roof. However, the EXP 15 also gets an imposing front-end design with a large hexagonal grille flanked by thin LED headlights, cues which look nothing like the older Bentleys, or even any modern ones for that matter. Instead of a series of swooping curves, this concept also gets its fair share of angles and creases that accentuate the car’s size and its profile.

The Pallas Gold paint is another modern touch in itself. Not just because it’s a hue you might expect on a luxury car, but because its ultra-thin aluminum pigment allows the safety radar devices to work by transmitting through it without losing signal quality.

It may not be quite as polarizing as Jaguar’s recent makeover, but this new concept’s exterior styling will probably split Bentley fans on whether it’s the right direction. One indisputably cool element, at least as far as I’m concerned, is the Flying B emblem on the hood, positioned just above the typical Bentley badge. And, even being an electric car, it does still at least have a grille (of sorts). Even though it’s not strictly necessary for cooling, Bentley design director Robin Page notes it still has strong cues like the vertical line down the center, and it presents “an opportunity to create a piece of digital art.”

The EXP 15’s exterior is a fun opening act, but then there’s the interior.

It wouldn’t be a proper concept if the Bentley EXP 15 didn’t have an outlandish interior, and it certainly does. First off, it only has three seats, to match the car’s door configuration, with one on the passenger side and two on the driver’s side. Not only does the wider door offer better accommodation for that one rear seat, but the seat itself even rotates 45 degrees to help that passenger get in and out. That creates a more gracious experience and Bentley, knowing all too well the sort of clientele who might shop its electric cars, says “you can just get out with dignity and the Instagram shot is perfect.”

The extra space in front of the single rear passenger, then, can be used for toting luggage or even pets. Beyond just creating luxury through space, though, the EXP 15 is packed with other cool touches like the glowing glass lamp and wood veneer on the “wing-shaped” dashboard. Behind the center screen, there’s the “Mechanical Marvel” centerpiece: a dial that resembles a radial plane engine and can show the state of charge or the direction of travel, among other functions. At the back, Bentley offers up more cargo space in the EXP 15 concept, as well as a picnic-style setup for outdoor parties.

We won’t see production versions of the EXP 15 on the roads…but we will see an electric Bentley soon.

Packed within the host of small touches Bentley brings to the EXP 15 concept, there are cues that will ultimately make it to the brand’s first production EV. We expect to see the actual production car emerge next year, likely as a small SUV rather than a huge sedan. The latter would fit a bit more into Bentley’s history, but given where the luxury market currently is, we should see the better-selling car debut in 2026 before anything else.",https://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/12-EXP-15-Driving.webp,N,,2025-07-08 15:14:41.461607

Pakistanis fed up with high utility costs are helping the country become one of the world's biggest markets for solar energy. Betsy Joles reports from Islamabad.

BETSY JOLES, BYLINE: In a village on the edge of Pakistan's capital city, Islamabad, chirping birds are drowned out by the whir of fans.

(SOUNDBITE OF FANS WHIRRING)

JOLES: It's the only way to cope with the heat, says resident Shinas Nasib (ph).

SHINAS NASIB: (Non-English language spoken).

JOLES: ""It's so hot here, we're all worried,"" she says. In recent years, human-caused climate change has accelerated warming and contributed to extreme weather in Pakistan.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken).

JOLES: Near Nasib's house, goats and chickens graze outside under the blazing afternoon sun.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Non-English language spoken).

JOLES: Nasib and her neighbors usually spend peak sunlight hours during the summer inside. But when daily power cuts occur, the fans stop working. So Nasib's family decided to invest in a solar panel. ""The fan works when we put it in the sun,"" Nasib says. ""It is truly a good thing.""

NASIB: (Non-English language spoken).

JOLES: Solar energy has taken Pakistan by storm. This boom can be seen on rooftops around the country, which now glimmer with rows and rows of solar panels. Solar helps reduce planet-heating pollution. Jan Rosenow at the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Institute says Pakistan's solar boom is in many ways remarkable.

JAN ROSENOW: The scale of solar being deployed in such a short period of time has not been seen, I think, anywhere ever before.

JOLES: Things really took off last year when an oversupply of solar panels from China flooded the Pakistani market and pushed prices for this technology way down. Pakistanis were quick to buy them up. Waqas Moosa, chairman of the Pakistan Solar Association, says Pakistan's solar rush is unique because it was almost entirely people-driven.

WAQAS MOOSA: Individuals have made this decision, so it's like a democratization of solar.

JOLES: But it's mostly out of necessity, not environmental concerns. Pakistan has the most expensive electricity in the region. And an unreliable grid is blamed for power outages and even countrywide blackouts. Moosa says some Pakistani solar users may soon go completely off grid as they get access to cheaper and more reliable batteries. Then they could store solar power and use it during non-sunlight hours.

MOOSA: Batteries are coming to town, you know? Everything is now put in place.

JOLES: But as more and more people get solar and leave the grid behind, that presents a financial challenge.

AWAIS LEGHARI: Demand has gone down. The same number of payments need to be made by a lesser number of consumers.

JOLES: This is Pakistan's energy minister, Awais Leghari. He says the government is looking for ways to bring more industrial consumers onto the grid while planning targeted subsidies for low-income users.

LEGHARI: Our challenge is to get the demand to go up.

JOLES: Last month, the government announced a 10% tax on imported solar panels, almost all of which come from China. It was initially announced at 18%, which many solar advocates protested. Khalid Waleed, an energy economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad, says many have already poured their savings into solar.

KHALID WALEED: People have invested their retirement benefits, their remittances money. And even the female of the household, they sell their gold just to sort of offset that increasing electricity bills.

JOLES: He says the group that might get priced out of solar is the same one that may have to pay higher electricity prices to make up for those who've left the grid.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Non-English language spoken).

JOLES: At a training course at National Skills University in Islamabad, students want to be part of the solar boom. Forty-two-year-old electrician Adnan Shams (ph), who's learning how to install solar, says this kind of work is increasing because people are seeing the benefits.

ADNAN SHAMS: (Non-English language spoken).

JOLES: Because of this, he expects it to be a busy summer.

Although H.R.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R.
Taken together, H.R.
Supporters of the bill may believe they are voting for opportunity and security, but in truth, H.R.","The “One Big Beautiful Bill” (H.R. 1, 119th Congress) is being promoted as a pro-growth, pro-worker initiative. But for many Arizonans, especially working families, the bill’s sweeping changes could deepen inequality, undermine essential services, and destabilize the state’s long-term economic outlook.

At the heart of the bill is a permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts, which primarily benefit corporations and high-income earners. In a state where the median household income is below the national average, at about $72,000, most Arizona families will see little impact. Although H.R. 1 proposes eliminating federal taxes on tips and overtime, this gesture does little for low-wage workers who already pay little or no federal income tax. Payroll taxes still apply, and wage theft, a common issue in low-income sectors, remains unaddressed.

The bill expands some itemized deductions, which disproportionately benefit wealthier households. Meanwhile, it fails to restore full refundability of the Child Tax Credit, a provision that once lifted thousands of Arizona children out of poverty. More than 900,000 children in the state benefited from the pandemic-era expansion of this credit, benefits that would disappear under H.R. 1.

In addition to tax policy, the bill makes major changes to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. It imposes stricter work-reporting requirements that could jeopardize health and food assistance for many Arizonans, especially those in seasonal or unstable jobs. Nearly 2 million state residents depend on Medicaid. Under these new requirements, a missed deadline could result in a loss of coverage. Similarly, increased SNAP documentation rules would disproportionately harm rural areas, where access to stable employment and affordable food is limited.

The bill’s environmental rollbacks pose further risks. H.R. 1 eliminates federal incentives for renewable energy and energy-efficient housing, while increasing subsidies for fossil fuels. This change threatens Arizona’s growing clean energy sector, including over 8,000 solar jobs, and worsens public health outcomes. Phoenix already ranks among the most polluted cities in the country. Without environmental protections, vulnerable communities face heightened exposure to air pollution, extreme heat and water scarcity.

H.R. 1 also allocates nearly $150 billion toward expanding border enforcement and detention. In Arizona, where over 13% of the population is foreign-born, these provisions could increase fear and instability within mixed-status households. The ripple effects of family separation and deportation would be felt across neighborhoods, schools and local economies that rely on immigrant labor.

Financially, the bill raises serious alarms. According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 1 would add between $2.4 and $2.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. As interest payments grow, discretionary spending on critical services like education and infrastructure could be cut. Arizona already ranks near the bottom nationally in per-pupil education funding. Further austerity would only widen those gaps.

Taken together, H.R. 1 represents far more than a simple tax or spending package; it is a broad rewrite of America’s social contract. By prioritizing tax relief for corporations and the wealthy, slashing social supports, rolling back environmental protections, and halting emerging technology oversight, the bill risks entrenching inequality and leaving working people to shoulder its consequences.

Supporters of the bill may believe they are voting for opportunity and security, but in truth, H.R. 1 could erode the very foundations of economic stability. Jobs may vanish to unregulated automation; food and health support may be lost to rigid work rules; and clean air and water may become luxuries instead of rights. Even the promised tax relief will largely bypass households earning under $90,000, while rising debt threatens the programs millions depend on.

History shows that great nations do not thrive by hollowing out their social support. H.R. 1, and the political forces behind it, risk becoming a turning point where short-term promises eclipse long-term stability. Arizona residents should look closely at what is being proposed and who truly stands to benefit.",https://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2024/12/Trump-news-conference.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 14:20:24.582235
,IRA Tax Credits,2025-07-08 17:45:34+00:00,Grant Thornton,New law brings in significant tax changes — and opportunities - Grant Thornton,Not Available,,,,,https://www.grantthornton.com/insights/alerts/tax/2025/legislative-updates/new-law-brings-in-significant-tax-changes,"The final legislation does, however, make substantial changes to core international tax provisions, particularly GILTI, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction (FDII), the foreign tax credit regime, and the base-erosion avoidance tax (BEAT).
After factoring in the disallowance of a portion of the foreign tax credit, the combined effective rate to eliminate U.S. residual tax rises to 14% (compared with 13.125% under current law).
In connection with this change, the rules for determining the net CFC tested income foreign tax credit limitation were also revised.
The effective tax rate increases to approximately 14% for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, by reducing the Section 250 deduction from 37.5% to 33.34%.
Lower rates, higher standard deductions, an increased child tax credit, increased estate and lifetime gift tax exemptions, an increased alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption, a modified mortgage interest deduction and an end to miscellaneous itemized deductions are all made permanent in the new law.","The more favorable calculation to determine the limitation for business interest expense under Section 163(j) — which uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) instead of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and expired at the end of 2021 — has been restored and made permanent for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. The final bill also includes a rule that provides for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, that the 163(j) limitation applies to certain capitalized interest.

In the case of expensing for research and experimentation (R&E) expenditures, the bill provides a partial restoration to pre-TCJA law rather than a full one. Since 2022, R&E spending has been required to be capitalized and amortized over a number of years — five years for domestic research and 15 years for foreign research — rather than immediately deducted. The OBBBA restores expensing, but for domestic R&E activities only, under new Section 174A. For domestic R&E, taxpayers can immediately deduct expenses or, for domestic R&E that is not chargeable to property of a character subject to the allowance under Section 167, may elect to capitalize and recover such expenditures over a period of at least 60 months, starting with the month in which the taxpayer first realizes benefits from such expenditures. Alternatively, taxpayers may elect under Section 59(e) to capitalize and recover domestic R&E over 10 years. In another deviation from the pre-TCJA Section 174, software development continues to be deemed R&E. Several concurring amendments were made to coordinate with other provisions, such as Section 280C(c), which generally requires the deduction under Section 174A to be reduced by any research credit taken under Section 41. It removes the prohibition on the recovery of unamortized basis in capitalized domestic R&E upon disposition. These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024.

Transition rules generally allow taxpayers to deduct the unamortized domestic R&E expenditures made in taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2021, and before Jan. 1, 2025, over a one- or two-year period. There are special transition rules for small business taxpayers with average annual gross receipts of $31 million or less, including a rule that allows them to make (or revoke) an election to claim the reduced Section 41 research credit under Section 280C(c) on an amended return.

Foreign R&E expenditures muststill be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year window. As of May 12, 2025, the prohibition on immediately recovering the unamortized basis in foreign capitalized R&E expenses for any property abandoned, disposed, or retired is clarified to also prohibit a reduction to the amount realized upon disposition, therefore requiring foreign R&E to continue to be amortized.

The bill also provides a more generous limitation for the deduction of Section 179 property, a new deduction for qualified business property, enhancement of the advanced manufacturing investment credit, a permanent new markets tax credit and a permanent enhancement of the low-income housing tax credit, among other business incentives.

Pass-through entities, which won a significant change in the TCJA with the creation of the Section 199A deduction for qualified business income (QBI), also achieved permanence of this key provision in this year’s bill — though the deduction was not increased from 20% to 23% as proposed by the House. For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, the income limitation phase-in will be increased from $50,000 to $75,000 for individuals (from $100,000 to $150,000 for joint filers); and there will be a new minimum deduction set at $400 (for a taxpayer with aggregated QBI of at least $1,000 with respect to qualified trades or businesses in which the taxpayer materially participates as defined in the Section 469 passive activity rules). The modified phase-in income limitation and new minimum deduction will each be adjusted annually for inflation beginning in 2027.

A less favorable change for business taxpayers is a permanent extension of the limitation on excess business losses. However, a provision was dropped that was in earlier versions of the legislation and would have required disallowed losses be taken into account in determining a taxpayer’s excess business losses in subsequent years — stacking these losses over time unless there was active business income to offset, with no NOL to offset other sources of income.

Also less favorable is a new floor on charitable contributions made by corporations. For tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, a deduction will only be allowed if contributions total at least 1% of the corporation’s taxable income, and disallowed contributions under the 1% floor can be carried forward only from years in which the taxpayer exceeds the 10% ceiling for contributions.

The bill adds a provision that makes self-executing the provision in the statute that recharacterizes certain transactions between partners, as well as between a partner and a partnership. With this new provision, these rules can be applied without needing specific regulations to be in place, contrary to the argument that has been made by some taxpayers (in the context of disguised sale of partnership interests) that the provision is not operative until regulations are in place.

The bill expands Section 1202 to provide further benefits to owners of certain small businesses. Under the legislation, certain gains from the sale of stock issued after July 4, 2025, may be eligible for at least a 50% exclusion up to the greater of $15 million, or 10 times the taxpayer’s adjusted basis in the stock. This is an increase from the historical limit of $10 million under previous law. As well, taxpayers have historically been eligible for a Section 1202 exclusion only if they held the stock for at least five years; now, they are eligible for a 50% exclusion of their gain after three years, a 75% exclusion after four years, and a 100% exclusion after five years. Finally, the bill raises the ceiling for a corporation’s aggregate gross assets from $50 million to $75 million to be defined as a qualified small business.

Qualified opportunity zones

The bill makes permanent the benefits available to investments in qualified opportunity zones (QOZs) that were introduced by the TCJA, with certain modifications. The changes contained in the bill generally impact investments made after Dec. 31, 2026.

To ensure that the tracts designated as QOZs reflect updated census information, the bill provides for the recurring designation of census tracts as QOZs for 10-year periods. The bill also tightens the qualifications for a census tract to qualify as a QOZ and repeals the “contiguous census tract” rule that applied to the initial tranche of QOZ designations following the TCJA.

Deferred gains invested in qualified opportunity funds (QOFs) after Dec. 31, 2026, will be included in income on the earlier of either (i) the date the investment is sold or exchanged, or (ii) five years after the date the investment in the qualified opportunity fund was made. Taxpayers holding their QOF investments for at least five years will receive a basis increase in their investment equal to 10% of the original deferred gain. The basis increase is enhanced to 30% for investments in “qualified rural opportunity funds.”

The bill also codifies significant reporting obligations for QOFs, including information about stock and partnership interests held by the QOF such as the amount invested, its value, the NAICS code that applies to the underlying business, the number of employees, etc. The bill adds specific penalties for failing to comply with the reporting requirements.

Energy tax credits

The new law is much closer to the Senate’s version of changes to Inflation Reduction Act credits than the House’s version, a minor victory for companies and investors in renewable energy projects. Notably, the transferability of a variety of credits was preserved, though some credits will be phased out sooner than previously scheduled. As with earlier drafts of the legislation, most credits now include restrictions on applicability to specified foreign entities and foreign influenced entities.

Under OBBBA, wind and solar facilities claiming the 45Y clean electricity production credit or 48E clean electricity investment credit will need to be placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins within 12 months of July 4, 2025. All other types of projects eligible for the credit can continue to claim the credits if they begin construction by Dec. 31, 2032, at which point a phasedown starts. Additionally, the new rule includes the restriction of either credit on property that would have qualified as residential clean energy property under 25D if the taxpayer is the lessor of such property. The 25D credit was also repealed for any expenditures made after Dec 31, 2025.

In a scale back of the 45X advanced manufacturing production credit, wind components produced and sold after Dec 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible. The new law also phases out the credit for applicable critical minerals (which was previously permanent) for those produced after 2030.

The 45V clean hydrogen production credit will sunset for qualified facilities for which construction begins after Jan 1, 2028, five years earlier than previously scheduled. The timeline for credits for nuclear power production (45U) and carbon sequestration (45Q) projects remains unchanged, though both incorporate the new restrictions for specified foreign entities. The 45Z clean fuel production tax credit was extended from a scheduled expiration for fuel sold after Dec. 31, 2027, to fuel sold after Dec. 31, 2029, though fuel produced after Dec. 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from a feedstock that was produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada.

The electric vehicle tax credits (25E, 30D, and 45W) for used, new, and commercial vehicles will now sunset for vehicles acquired and placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025, though the alternative fueling vehicle property tax credit (30C), will remain available for EV charging stations placed in service through June 30, 2026.

Overall, the final bill focused on scaling back energy incentives prioritized by the Biden administration but stopped short of cutting credits as deeply as many companies and investors had feared based on statements from the administration and the House-passed version.

The final legislation does, however, make substantial changes to core international tax provisions, particularly GILTI, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction (FDII), the foreign tax credit regime, and the base-erosion avoidance tax (BEAT). The GILTI changes appear to be aimed at making the U.S. system become more closely aligned with the OECD’s 15% global minimum tax standard, without formally adopting Pillar Two.

GILTI reforms

The bill increases the effective corporate tax rate on GILTI from 10.5% to approximately 12.6% for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, by reducing the Section 250 deduction from 50% to 40% and the foreign tax credit haircut from 20% to 10%. After factoring in the disallowance of a portion of the foreign tax credit, the combined effective rate to eliminate U.S. residual tax rises to 14% (compared with 13.125% under current law). The legislation also eliminates the net deemed tangible income return (NDTIR), which had allowed for a 10% return on qualified business asset investment (QBAI) to be excluded. With the removal of this exclusion, GILTI now captures all returns, including those from tangible assets, and is renamed “net CFC tested income” to reflect the broader base. Finally, the bill expands the disallowance of 10% of foreign tax credits for taxes paid, accrued, or deemed paid with respect to distributions of previously taxed net CFC tested income excluded from gross income under Section 959(a) by reason of a prior GILTI inclusion under Section 951A(a), effective for amounts included after June 28, 2025.

In connection with this change, the rules for determining the net CFC tested income foreign tax credit limitation were also revised. Under the updated approach, the Section 250 deduction and certain taxes are allocated to foreign source net CFC tested income, while no interest or R&E expenses are allocable. Other deductions are allocable only if they are “directly allocable” to such income.

FDII reforms

The bill makes similar changes to the FDII regime to align it with the GILTI reforms. The effective tax rate increases to approximately 14% for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025, by reducing the Section 250 deduction from 37.5% to 33.34%. The calculation of deduction eligible income (DEI) now excludes gains from the sale or disposition of intangible property and any other depreciable property. It also updates the allocation rules so that DEI is reduced by expenses and deductions, including taxes, that are properly allocable to the gross income, but does not reduce DEI for interest expense or research and experimental expenditures.

As with GILTI, the 10% return on qualified business asset investment is eliminated. With this change, FDII now includes returns from tangible assets and is renamed “foreign-derived deduction eligible income,” reflecting both the broader base and the shift away from intangible returns.

BEAT reforms

The final bill moderated the Senate’s proposed larger changes to the BEAT, raising the rate from 10% to 10.5%, rather than the proposed 14%, permanently exclude the research credit and a portion of applicable Section 38 credits from reducing regular tax liability for purposes of computing a BEAT liability, and dropping a proposed exclusion for base erosion payments to high-tax jurisdictions.

Permanent CFC look-through

The bill makes permanent the long-standing look-through rule under Section 954(c)(6), which was originally enacted as a temporary provision and most recently extended through Dec. 31, 2025. The rule excludes from foreign personal holding company income certain dividends, interest, rents and royalties received by a controlled foreign corporation from a related CFC, to the extent the payments are attributable to earnings and profits that do not give rise to Subpart F income in the hands of the payor CFC.

Limitation on downward attribution

The legislation also restores Section 958(b)(4), reversing the repeal enacted under the TCJA. The repeal had allowed stock owned by foreign persons to be broadly attributed downward to related U.S. persons which, in turn, caused certain foreign corporations to be treated as CFCs even when no U.S. shareholder had actual control. This led to unintended inclusions under Subpart F and GILTI for indirect U.S. owners and created onerous filing requirements. The bill addresses this by reinstating the pre-TCJA limitation on downward attribution.

In addition, the bill introduces a new Section 951B, which applies Subpart F and GILTI inclusion rules to “foreign controlled United States shareholders” of “foreign controlled foreign corporations.” The provision is intended to narrowly target structures viewed by Congress as abusive, realigning the rules with the original policy objectives of the TCJA.

In an ongoing debate that divided both Republicans and Democrats since 2017, GOP House members from districts with the highest taxes (generally in California, New Jersey and New York) pushed for elimination of the SALT cap — or for a significant increase at the least. In the House bill, they settled for a cap of $40,000 in 2025, increasing 1% annually through 2033, then holding steady. That version also added a rapid income phasedown beginning at a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $500,000 and ending at $600,000 (with 1% annual increases in the MAGI amounts). Once the maximum MAGI was reached, SALT deductions would have been limited to $10,000. (These figures were all cut in half for married couples filing separately.) With no Republican champions of the SALT cap in the Senate, however, the final provision was scaled back. Under the new law, the cap will increase to $40,000 in 2025, increase 1% annually through 2029, and then revert to $10,000. The rapid income limitation phasedown remains, beginning at $500,000 and ending at $600,000 (with 1% annual increases in the MAGI amounts) for most filers. Once the income limitation is exceeded, SALT deductions are limited to $10,000. (The cap, income threshold and floor are all cut in half for married couples filing separately.)

Provisions for tax-exempt organizations

The most notable change in the law for most tax-exempt organizations is the expanded application of excessive compensation restrictions, with the definition of “covered employees” changed starting in 2026 to include all employees or former employees, rather than only the five highest-paid employees in a year (plus anyone previously deemed to be covered). This aligns the restrictions for not-for-profit entities with those for taxable entities.

In a year when they have been under great scrutiny by Republicans, private colleges and universities were spared an increase on their net investment income to as much as 21%, a provision which was included in the original House-passed version. The final bill took the Senate’s proposal, increasing the tax from 1.4% to 4% for schools with per-student endowments of more than $750,000 but not more than $2 million, and to 8% for those greater than $2 million. Smaller schools are excluded from the excise tax as the floor on student population for application of the tax increased from 500 to 3,000 students.

Not included in the final bill was an increase in the current 1.39% tax on the net investment income of private foundations with assets of $50 million or more (to as much as 10%), which was in the bill originally passed by the House.

Individual tax provisions

As the driving force behind this year’s reconciliation effort, making permanent many of the individual tax changes from the TCJA constituted the largest cost of the massive bill. Lower rates, higher standard deductions, an increased child tax credit, increased estate and lifetime gift tax exemptions, an increased alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption, a modified mortgage interest deduction and an end to miscellaneous itemized deductions are all made permanent in the new law.

Given the beneficial changes associated with the SALT deduction, the Section 199A deduction and the Section 1202 exclusion, individuals may be more inclined to consider the use of non-grantor trusts as part of their individual income tax planning. The use of non-grantor trusts should consider corresponding transfer tax consequences, state responses to certain types of non-grantor trusts, as well as anti-avoidance laws.

Trump’s top priorities for the bill were all included for the years of his term in office, with new above-the-line deductions for taxes on tip income, overtime pay and interest on loans for new U.S.-made vehicles in tax years 2025-2028. Caps proposed by the Senate on tips and overtime did prevail in the final bill, at $25,000 for tips and $12,000 for individuals/$24,000 for joint filers for overtime. Vehicle loan interest is capped at $10,000, and all the provisions are subject to income thresholds. While Congress could not exempt Social Security income from taxes — the president’s other campaign promise and priority — under budget reconciliation rules, seniors will receive a $6,000 addition to their standard deduction during the four-year period, subject to income thresholds.

For those taxpayers who itemize, a new floor has been imposed on charitable deductions of 0.5% of AGI. However, the cash contribution limit has been permanently increased from 50% of AGI to 60%. For non-itemizers, an above-the-line deduction for charitable giving has been revived, now allowing up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for joint filers.

The bill creates a new tax-preferred savings vehicle for children — a new type of individual retirement account (IRA) dubbed a “Trump account” that can be established for children with a Social Security Number. The accounts will be allowed contributions of up to $5,000 annually (with no tax write-off for the donor; no limit on contributions from tax-exempt entities; limits on contributions from employers), indexed for inflation beginning in 2027, and must be invested in qualified index tracking funds. Withdrawals can be made after age 18, but unlike in earlier iterations of the bill, there are no rules specifying the use of the funds, such as for education. In a pilot program, the federal government will establish and seed accounts with $1,000 for all U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2026, and Dec. 31, 2028.

A new tax on remittance transfers also is included in the new law but in a significantly revised form from the original House-passed provision. While the initial version would have imposed a 3.55% tax on all remittance transfers and provided a credit refunding taxes paid by U.S. citizens and nationals, the final version imposes a lower tax of 1.5% only on transfers made using cash, money order, cashier’s check or similar financial instruments. This applies to all senders, regardless of citizenship, but the provision excludes transfers made from U.S. bank accounts or using U.S. credit or debit cards.

The bill does not address a couple of key areas affecting individual partners in partnerships that have been the subject of significant interest in recent years. First, the legislation does not address the exception for self-employment tax for limited partners, which has been the subject of litigation and an IRS compliance campaign in the last several years. Also, the bill does not add any new provision relating to carried interest, leaving taxpayers with the provision enacted as part of the TCJA that generally recharacterizes gains from assets held for three years or less through an applicable partnership interest as short-term capital gains, which are typically taxed at higher ordinary income rates.",https://www.grantthornton.com/insights/alerts/tax/2025/legislative-updates/new-law-brings-in-significant-tax-changes/_jcr_content/socialImage.coreimg.jpeg/1751974985314/ct-2025-caucasian-senators-talking-in-capitol.jpeg,N,,2025-07-08 14:21:47.380060

Luxury SUVs and EVs are the darlings of this market, and the companies enabling their trade will profit.","The used-car market isn't just surviving—it's thriving. While tariffs on new vehicles send shockwaves through the auto industry, investors are missing a golden opportunity in two unstoppable trends: luxury SUVs and electric vehicles (EVs). The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index (MUVVI) just hit 208.5, up 6.3% year-over-year, and it's the EV and luxury segments driving this surge. This isn't a blip—it's a structural shift. Here's why you should buy into this now, and which stocks to target.

The Numbers Are Unstoppable: Luxury, SUVs, and EVs Are the New Black

The luxury segment is leading the charge, with prices up 8.8% year-over-year in June—the fifth straight month of dominance. SUVs are close behind at 6%, but the real fireworks are in EVs, which spiked 12.1% as used-car buyers snap up these vehicles ahead of expiring tax credits. This isn't a coincidence.

Why now?

- Tariffs are killing new-car sales: June's new-vehicle sales fell 4.2% year-over-year as buyers balk at rising costs.

- Supply is tight: Off-lease inventory is drying up, and trade-ins aren't keeping pace. Luxury SUVs, in particular, are scarce—so prices keep climbing.

- EV demand is roaring back: After a dip in 2023-24, used-EV values are surging as buyers bet on tax credits expiring by Q3 2025. Even luxury EV SUVs are flying off lots.

This Isn't a Bubble—It's a Structural Shift

The data is clear: the used-car market is normalizing after pandemic chaos. Retail days' supply stabilized at 45 days in June, and Cox Automotive expects the MUVVI to end 2025 1.8% higher than last year. But here's the kicker: the EV segment isn't just catching up—it's lapping the field.

The Playbook: Buy Used-Car Retailers and EV Infrastructure Now

This isn't about flipping cars—it's about owning the distribution channels and technological edge that will dominate this market.

CarMax (KMX): America's largest used-car retailer is a must-buy. Its Q2 sales data should reflect the luxury/SUV boom. With 45 stores in high-demand markets, CarMax is perfectly positioned to capitalize on rising prices and EV demand.

Cox Automotive (CACC): The parent company behind Manheim is the backbone of this industry. Its data platforms and auction networks give it unmatched insight into supply trends. If luxury and EV values keep rising, Cox's margins will expand.

EV-focused platforms: Look to companies like Vroom (VRM) or Shift (GEAR), which are pivoting to EV specialization. Used-EV demand is outpacing supply, and players with inventory and tech to authenticate these vehicles will win.

The Risk? Sure, But the Upside Is Massive

Yes, tariffs could ease, and some of the 12% EV gains might flatten. But here's the deal: luxury buyers aren't price-sensitive, and EV tax credits are a ticking clock. Even if growth moderates, the supply-demand imbalance means values won't crash. This is a multi-year trend.

Final Call: Load Up on Used-Car Plays—And Bet on EVs

The Manheim Index isn't just a number—it's a roadmap. Luxury SUVs and EVs are the darlings of this market, and the companies enabling their trade will profit. Buy CarMax, Cox, and EV specialists now. This isn't a guess—it's a no-brainer in a market desperate for resilience.

Action Plan:

- Aggressively overweight used-car retailers in your portfolio.

- Dollar-cost average into EV-focused platforms as volatility hits.

- Avoid new-car manufacturers until tariffs resolve—this isn't their moment.

The used-car boom isn't ending here—it's just getting started. Don't be left behind.",,N,,2025-07-08 14:20:09.493877

The program, called Thriving Nonprofits, is a partnership between the City of Indianapolis’ Office of Sustainability and IFF, a mission-driven lender and real estate consultant. It is funded by the McKinney Family Foundation with additional support from Glick Philanthropies.

The ten organizations selected for the program are:

Outreach, Inc.

Second Helpings, Inc.

Aspire Higher Foundation, Inc.

HealthNet, Inc.

B-SIDE Creative Campus

Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center

Coburn Place Safe Haven

Fairview Presbyterian Church

Community Alliance of the Far Eastside

Community Action of Greater Indiana

Each organization will receive a comprehensive energy assessment conducted by IFF’s Real Estate Solutions team. The goal is to identify potential building upgrades — from lighting retrofits to HVAC replacements — that will lead to long-term cost savings and improved environmental performance.

“Public-private partnerships like Thriving Nonprofits exemplify the ability of the Indianapolis community to come together to achieve common goals like energy efficiency,” said Mo McReynolds, director of the Office of Sustainability. “We are excited to build upon our existing energy benchmarking program Thriving Buildings by offering new opportunities for our local nonprofits — entities that typically operate on very slim margins — to significantly invest in their physical infrastructure so that they may continue serving our neighbors.”

The assessments will include walk-through evaluations of key building components such as insulation, windows, doors, appliances and mechanical systems. Energy bills, weather conditions and seasonal trends will also be analyzed to help nonprofits understand their current energy use. Organizations will receive a detailed report outlining short- and long-term upgrade options, ranked by complexity and cost.

Amandula Anderson, IFF’s executive director for the Indiana Region, emphasized the practical value of the initiative.

“Relatively small building upgrades can result in significant monthly cost savings, and IFF is excited to begin working with cohort members to identify opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings,” Anderson said. “Based on our experience supporting similar programs elsewhere in the state, we expect Thriving Nonprofits to help local organizations devote more of their funding to programming that benefits Indianapolis residents instead of their utility bills.”

The matching grants provided will support projects such as LED lighting upgrades, weatherization, solar panel installation and the purchase of high-efficiency appliances. Cohort members will also have access to flexible IFF loans to help finance additional improvements as needed. All upgrades are expected to be completed by Dec. 1, 2025.

In addition to the building assessments and grant funding, each participating nonprofit will have the opportunity to engage in educational seminars that encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing and long-term strategic planning for facility improvements.

The initiative also supports the Indianapolis’ larger sustainability goals outlined in Thrive Indianapolis, a citywide climate and resilience action plan. Thriving Nonprofits will advance multiple objectives in the plan, including expanding financing options for energy efficiency and electrification, increasing access to solar power and encouraging water conservation.

By investing in energy upgrades for mission-driven organizations, the city hopes to not only lower operating costs for vital community service providers but also reduce emissions and make Indianapolis more resilient in the face of climate change.

Ford Motor Co. no longer believes jobs or investment are at risk at the battery plant it’s building in Michigan after President Donald Trump’s $3.4 trillion fiscal bill passed with fewer restrictions on production tax credits critical to the financial viability of the factory.

The automaker said in a statement July 8 that the battery facility in Marshall, Mich., is “on track to qualify for the production tax credit.” A company spokesperson said the $3 billion facility is on schedule to open next year and will ultimately employ 1,700 workers as the company had projected when it downsized the project in late 2023.

Executive Chair Bill Ford warned in May that the battery plant was “imperiled” by language in the bill that would have prevented the automaker from licensing technology from China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. because it was deemed a “foreign entity of concern.” But when the legislation reached the U.S. Senate, those restrictions were softened and that version of the bill was signed into law by Trump on July 4.

Ford intends to use the lower-cost lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries to be built at the Marshall plant to make more affordable electric vehicles starting under $30,000 that are due to arrive in 2027. The high cost of EVs is an impediment to mainstream acceptance of battery-powered vehicles.

And as the Biden Administration was very focused on environmental and climate justice in particular, the new bill targets many of those programs, too, and rescinds the Environmental Protection Agency’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program entirely.

Environmental activist Mustafa Ali put it plainly: “The bill greenlights pollution — literally. It weakens the Clean Air Act, disables the EPA’s ability to regulate toxic emissions, and rolls back protections for drinking water. It tells corporations they can dump, poison, and profit without consequence. And who suffers? The same people who always suffer.” Black, Brown, Indigenous, and low-income Americans.

Billions in Promised Grants Now in Jeopardy

Established through the Inflation Reduction Act, the program earmarked $2.8 billion in grants, and $200 million in technical assistance to invest in underserved communities —“80 times more than any federal investment in environmental justice in history,” Chandra Taylor-Sawyer, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, told Rolling Stone last year.

While many grants have already been paid out (which hasn’t stopped the EPA from attempting to take that money back), a significant amount of funding through the program remains unawarded. In February, a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said that over $1 billion in IRA environmental justice funding has not yet been obligated. The funding was supposed to remain available through September 30, 2026.

Lawsuits Push Back Against EPA’s Rollbacks

Green and Healthy Homes Initiative, which was named by the Biden Administration as a regional grantmakers for the Thriving Communities Grantmaking Program, one of a number of ways that the EPA’s IRA funds were being distributed, was one of three plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the EPA filed earlier this year after the agency tried to unilaterally cancel its block grant. The nonprofits won that suit last month.

“In the bill that went through the House and Senate, the Senate amended to not repeal obligated funds, but only rescind non-obligated funds,” explains Ruth Ann Norton, president of Green & Healthy Homes Initiative (GHHI). “Our funds are obligated, as our fourth-circuit ruling deemed. The cancellation of those grants was unlawful, in the words of the judge.”

Fighting for Communities

The Maryland-based GHHI is in the process of distributing its block grant to community-based organizations throughout the mid-Atlantic, the region the Biden EPA put it in charge of. “We do have about 111 identified subrecipients, 72 of which are fully contracted and have already started to draw on payments,” Norton says. “The whole reason that we work through this dispute is simply to ensure that communities have funds to address issues of environmental quality and to advance public health.”

In another class-action lawsuit that was just filed in June, a similar argument is being made that the EPA can’t reclaim money that was congressionally allocated. That suit seeks to have some 350 previously awarded grants, totaling $3 billion, reinstated.

The End of a Short-Lived Climate Justice Era?

While there’s a good chance that the legal argument will win there too, and the awarded grants will remain rewarded, the funding that was still available is now likely dead and gone – and the all-too-short era of when the federal government made an effort to address climate justice, funneled billions of dollars into doing so, now seems even more squarely behind us.

“We can’t lose our focus on mission,” Norton said, “but I don’t have an answer entirely where we’re gonna go for all of the money, cause even philanthropy doesn’t have enough money to backfill in many communities what government was otherwise funding.”",https://wordinblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2177991924.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:48.911441

July 7, 2025

By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:

Section 1. Purpose. For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar. The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation's natural landscape. Moreover, reliance on so-called “green” subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries. Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation.

Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to:

(a) rapidly eliminate the market distortions and costs imposed on taxpayers by so-called “green” energy subsidies;

(b) build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind, solar, and other “green” energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and

(c) end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable “green” energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.

Sec. 3. Tax Credits and One Big Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the Treasury. (a) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

(b) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Sec. 4. One Big Beautiful Bill Act Implementation by the Department of the Interior. (a) Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a review of regulations, guidance, policies, and practices under the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction to determine whether any provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior shall then revise any identified regulations, guidance, policies, and practices as appropriate and consistent with applicable law to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar facilities.

Sec. 5. Reports. Within 45 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior shall submit a report to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the findings made under, and actions taken and planned to be taken to implement, this order.

Sec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:

(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or

(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of the Treasury.

This decision effectively hollows out NEPA’s foundational purpose and establishes a dangerous precedent that accelerating industrial development now takes priority over environmental responsibility, climate foresight and public health protection.
The National Environmental Policy Act has functioned for over four decades as America’s primary tool for environmental transparency.
When environmental reviews are weakened, public participation erodes.
Lawmakers can act decisively to reaffirm NEPA’s original intent by mandating that climate and cumulative health impacts be central to environmental reviews.","The Supreme Court’s decision in May to narrow the scope of environmental reviews under the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act is a dangerous concession to short-term development interests at the expense of long-term public and environmental health. Far from simply “streamlining” federal reviews, the ruling opens the door to projects with massive ecological and climate consequences, all while silencing the voices of the frontline communities that NEPA was designed to protect.

At the heart of this ruling lies the Uinta Basin Railway, a massive crude oil transport project in Utah and Colorado that epitomizes the type of high-risk development NEPA was expressly designed to evaluate. The railway would move up to 350,000 barrels of oil per day through wildfire-prone terrain, critical wildlife corridors and hydrologically sensitive areas, including parts of the Colorado River basin. These are not abstract risks; they are well-documented threats to regional air quality, water security and ecological resilience.

Yet under the high court’s new interpretation, federal agencies are no longer obligated to assess these broader downstream impacts. This decision effectively hollows out NEPA’s foundational purpose and establishes a dangerous precedent that accelerating industrial development now takes priority over environmental responsibility, climate foresight and public health protection.

On the surface, the court’s ruling may sound like a pragmatic effort to reduce bureaucratic delay. In reality, it unleashes unchecked development with minimal public accountability.

The National Environmental Policy Act has functioned for over four decades as America’s primary tool for environmental transparency. It allows communities, scientists and policymakers to evaluate how major projects will affect air quality, drinking water, biodiversity and climate resilience. NEPA does not prohibit development but rather demands that development proceed with full knowledge of its consequences. Crucially, it guarantees that those most impacted — often low-income, rural or historically marginalized communities — have a formal voice in shaping the decisions that affect their health and environment.

When environmental reviews are weakened, public participation erodes. And, like a landslide, the erosion of credible science, fairness of the process and the legitimacy of the final decision crumbles.

This ruling does not simply just greenlight a single oil rail project, it sets a sweeping legal precedent that could allow infrastructure projects nationwide to bypass or dramatically curtail meaningful environmental review. From pipelines proposed in coastal wetlands to mining operations in wildfire-prone regions and energy corridors near indigenous lands, the decision weakens the federal government’s obligation to fully assess long-term ecological and community impacts.

Without robust oversight, developers will face fewer questions about methane emissions, biodiversity loss, groundwater contamination and the compounding effects of fossil fuel expansion on the climate crisis. The result is a regulatory landscape where high-risk projects can advance with limited scrutiny, undermining both environmental safeguards and public trust.

It is difficult to view this ruling in isolation. It reflects a broader and troubling pattern in American environmental policy in which short-term industrial gains are prioritized over long-term public health, ecological resilience and intergenerational responsibility.

Proponents argue that scaling back environmental review will reduce red tape and accelerate economic growth. But at what cost? The historical record is clear: from the toxic legacy of Love Canal to the devastating contamination of the Animas River, we’ve seen what happens when development proceeds without adequate scrutiny. In each case, it was local communities, not corporations, that suffered the consequences.

Environmental impact assessments are not bureaucratic obstacles. They act as foundational safeguards to ensure that decisions are made transparently and equitably, not solely at the discretion of powerful private interests. These assessments help level the playing field, giving everyday Americans a voice in developments that directly affect their lives. Dismantling these protections may expedite pipelines and freeways, but at the cost of creating a system where families live in the shadow of industrial expansion, their health and futures treated as collateral.

Congress still has the power to respond. Lawmakers can act decisively to reaffirm NEPA’s original intent by mandating that climate and cumulative health impacts be central to environmental reviews. Federal agencies, in turn, must reestablish that meaningful public engagement is not a procedural formality, but a fundamental requirement. And states, many of which maintain their own environmental assessment frameworks, can step up where federal oversight falters, implementing more rigorous localized protections.

As the pace and intensity of the climate crisis accelerates, the public needs more transparency, not less, and more accountability, not expanded loopholes. While this ruling may offer legal relief to developers, it marks a grave retreat from our commitments to environmental justice and a future built with foresight, not sacrificed to expedience.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/AP23221778431227-e1751918975131.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-08 14:21:10.990204

“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” states the order issued late Monday.
While eliminating most renewable energy policies implemented by the Biden administration, Congress also acted at the behest of Republican lawmakers to shield some tax credits on projects in their districts under certain conditions.
That offered a few bits of hope to offshore wind industry advocates that some credits might be extended for a limited time.
Meanwhile, opponents of specific projects and ardent critics of wind and solar overall had demanded an even harder line, lobbying for last-minute changes.","Days after the Republican majority in Congress sharply reduced incentives for wind and solar energy projects, President Trump issued a new executive order to set new timeline limits for developers to qualify for tax credits.

“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” states the order issued late Monday. “Reliance on so-called ‘green’ subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.”

The order comes after Trump on July 4 signed sweeping spending and policy legislation passed by Congress. While eliminating most renewable energy policies implemented by the Biden administration, Congress also acted at the behest of Republican lawmakers to shield some tax credits on projects in their districts under certain conditions.

That offered a few bits of hope to offshore wind industry advocates that some credits might be extended for a limited time. Meanwhile, opponents of specific projects and ardent critics of wind and solar overall had demanded an even harder line, lobbying for last-minute changes.

Trump’s latest order appears to grow from that schism, and now promises to “build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind, solar, and other ‘green’ energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.”

In New York and New Jersey, local community activists and commercial fishermen have pressed the Trump administration to again rescind permits for the 810-megawatt Empire Wind turbine array, now under construction near the vessel traffic lanes into New York Harbor. One of their arguments points to developer Equinor’s majority ownership by the Norwegian government, and it’s unclear if Empire Wind could be threatened again.

Among its explicit directions, the executive order calls for the Treasury Department “to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.”

Renewable energy critics had protested that the Senate legislation went too far in granting leeway for projects under construction.

The new order calls for Treasury to be “issuing new and revised guidance… to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”",https://s3.divcom.com/www.nationalfisherman.com/images/Empire-Wind-Single-Spar-Towing-smaller-1024x682.jpeg.medium.800x800.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 15:16:17.697927

The new report follows by just days the passage of the congressional tax bill in a party-line vote that stymies the additions of low-cost and much-needed new solar, wind and battery power. Analysts predict that the legislation will reduce additions of the electricity needed to meet surging power demand, and spike wholesale electricity prices by as much as 25% in five years.

DOE has already falsely invoked emergency powers to prevent two fossil fuel plants from retiring despite regional and state approval and against the plant owners' wishes. This report promises to continue to usurp the process at the cost of consumers' pocketbooks.

The following is a comment from Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“It’s ironic that the Energy department is warning about reliability just days after Republicans in Congress repealed the clean energy tax credits. More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable and more resilient – all while saving consumers money on their electricity bills. Bailing out old, dirty coal, gas and oil plants would mean higher costs and a less reliable grid.”

“No matter how they try to gussy it up, bailing out coal or other fossil fuels when low-cost solar and wind power is growing so quickly makes even less sense today than it did in 2017 when the previous Trump administration tried it before. That’s why we will be fighting this plan, too.”

It includes major cuts to clean energy tax credits, pushed forward by the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The law is a huge setback against cutting emissions and transitioning to clean energy.
Geothermal and nuclear tax credits will stay in place until early 2030s.
“The EV tax credit, which is $7,500 off a new EV, that will expire September 30.","Last week a massive spending and tax bill, named the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” was signed into law by President Trump. It includes major cuts to clean energy tax credits, pushed forward by the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The law is a huge setback against cutting emissions and transitioning to clean energy. “How We Survive” host Amy Scott talks with Shannon Osaka, climate zeitgeist reporter at The Washington Post to find out more.

“It's hard to overestimate how devastating this bill will be to renewables in the United States,” Osaka says. “If you think about the long history of U.S. climate action, we waited quite literally decades to get a bill that was trying to boost wind and solar, to get all of these technologies on the grid, to encourage adoption of EVs.” The new law removes all these incentives and tax credits.

Osaka says it will take some time for some tax credits to phase out. Geothermal and nuclear tax credits will stay in place until early 2030s. But, she says, wind and solar are a different story. “Any wind or solar project has to begin construction within a year of the bill being signed.”

If you’re a consumer looking to take advantage of one of these clean energy tax credits, Osaka says you need to act fast. “The EV tax credit, which is $7,500 off a new EV, that will expire September 30. So if you're looking to buy a new EV, you should do that now,” Osaka says.

Rooftop solar is another big one, “It's like a 30% tax credit on the cost of those panels,” she says, “there's a little bit more time. I actually went and visited with some installers last week, and they said the end of 2025 but they're still a little bit uncertain about how the rules are going to shake out, so they want to be talking to customers who want to install rooftop solar again in the next three months to get things in order so that they can install that system before the end of the year.”

The law is also a blow to United States’ ability to stay competitive in the energy transition. “I think we're going to see a lot of investments moving overseas,” Osaka explains, “some of those companies are looking to places like India as a potential opportunity. And I think we're going to see China just continue to dominate the space of EV battery manufacturing [and] solar panel manufacturing.”

The funding, secured through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), was explicitly appropriated by Congress to ensure that communities across the country would have access to clean air, safe water, and healthy homes, with a particular focus on supporting disadvantaged communities nationwide. In today’s amicus brief, the attorneys general argue that the Trump Administration’s actions to terminate the grant program will leave hundreds of local communities nationwide unable to pursue vital environmental justice and public health projects — jeopardizing their fight for clean air, safe water, and climate resilience efforts.

“Congress directed these funds to protect public health and address long-standing environmental injustices in communities that have borne the brunt of pollution for decades,” said Attorney General Bonta. “We are not going to stand by while this administration continues to take illegal action and dismantle environmental justice programs where they are most urgently needed.”

More than 200 grantees of the terminated program within the coalition of states— including non-profits, local and regional governments, Native American tribes, and educational institutions — were slated to receive over $1.38 billion to support frontline communities in combating pollution, improving public health infrastructure, and building climate resilience. Due to the termination of this program, at least 40 grantees within California have lost access to over $301 million in funding from the EPA, which represents the greatest number of EPA grantees and highest amount of EJ funding from EPA flowing to any single state.

In the amicus brief, Attorney General Bonta, alongside the coalition, argues that:

The termination of the program disproportionately harms marginalized and historically disadvantaged communities — including Native American tribes, non-profits serving low-income neighborhoods, and communities of color — undermining the core purpose of Congress’s instruction to EPA when it passed the IRA.

By halting critical environmental justice and public health improvement projects, the Trump Administration’s actions put vulnerable populations at increased health risk.

“And the bill goes out of its way to encourage automakers to produce inefficient cars that are costly to fuel.”","President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ budget bill, which seeks to roll back climate and clean energy-related provisions, was passed by the US Congress this week.

The Trump administration has called the measure “transformative” and said it will head off looming tax hikes and unleash “clean, American-made energy.”

But environmental advocates worry the package could hurt the United States’ efforts to combat climate change and curb the use of clean energy in the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, behind China.

Here’s what to know:

What is happening to the bill?

Congressional Republicans passed Trump’s massive spending bill this week by razor-thin margins in the House and Senate, approving a package that would extend expiring tax cuts, cut the social safety net and boost immigration enforcement spending while adding an estimated US$3.3 trillion to the national debt.

The bill repeals many of former President Joe Biden’s green energy incentives, including some in his signature climate bill called the Inflation Reduction Act.

The bill also reduces spending on the Medicaid health programme and food aid for low-income Americans.

At the behest of Trump, lawmakers just barely made their self-imposed deadline to get a bill to the president to sign by the July 4 Independence Day holiday.

“

It’s clear that this deeply unpopular bill favours burning more fossil fuels while ignoring the damage it will do to people’s lives.

Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs, Environmental Defense Fund

What are the major clean energy provisions in the legislation?

The Senate had been considering a new excise tax on renewable energy as part of the budget bill, but lawmakers dropped the proposed tax before passing the broader legislation.

Despite this, Republican lawmakers are seeking to unwind some tax credits - or tax breaks - for renewable energy that had been included in the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022 during Biden’s administration.

These tax credits include breaks for “clean” vehicles and energy-efficient homes, among others.

The bill also attempts to roll back funding for a programme intended to help oil and natural gas producers cut methane emissions, among other provisions.

The bill makes it “much, much harder to build new clean energy projects,” said Joanna Slaney, vice president for political and government affairs for the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), an advocacy group.

“It’s clear that this deeply unpopular bill favours burning more fossil fuels while ignoring the damage it will do to people’s lives,” Slaney said.

The oil and gas industry, meanwhile, is praising the legislation, which could expedite new potential lease sales tied to fossil fuel projects. The bill directs the secretary of the interior to resume quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales, which were limited under Biden.

“This historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,” said Mike Sommers, CEO and President of the American Petroleum Institute (API).

What else are environmental advocates saying about the bill?

Despite the removal of the excise tax, the bill “is still devastating for the clean energy transition,” said Gretchen Goldman, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit group.

“The provisions attacking clean energy and clean transportation are not about the budget, but rather Congress using the budget bill to boost fossil fuels by crushing these booming new industries,” Goldman said.

Clean energy advocates have warned that the rollbacks will ultimately raise electricity prices for American consumers.

“It will only exacerbate the growing strain on the electric grid,” said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), a non-profit research group.

EPA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in opposition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) unlawful termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grant Program. The program, created and funded by Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to provide critical support to communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change.

“The EPA’s abrupt termination of the Environmental and Climate Justice Grant Program, without individual review or explanation, is just as unlawful as it is cruel. Congress appropriated this funding to address the longstanding and disproportionate environmental burdens faced by communities across the country that do not have the resources they urgently need,"" said AG Campbell. “All people – regardless of their background – deserve to live in a clean, healthy environment. I will continue to leverage the full weight and power of my office to prioritize and advance environmental and climate justice and fight back against this Administration’s unlawful policies.”

In the brief, AG Campbell and the coalition emphasize that by terminating this grant program, the federal government is inflicting serious, lasting harm on communities already grappling with disproportionate pollution burdens and the escalating effects of climate change. These communities, which are often low-income, communities of color, indigenous, or in rural areas, face overlapping environmental and public health crises.

The attorneys general explain that these challenges have only been made worse by historical discriminatory policies including racial segregation, redlining, and a systemic lack of investment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These communities are often under-resourced with limited access to vital needs like clean drinking water and are less equipped to recover from devastating weather-related events or to mitigate the increasing impact of climate change within their communities.

In 2022, Congress created the grant program under the Inflation Reduction Act, mandating that EPA distribute $3 billion to help address longstanding environmental disparities. In Massachusetts alone, there are an estimated nine grantees slated to receive more than $85 million from EPA under the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants program. The sudden termination of these grants has forced grantees to lay off staff, halt programming, and freeze hiring.

For example, Springfield, Massachusetts, which experienced five major disasters between 2011 and 2013 and has a 33% poverty rate and large immigrant population, was slated to receive $20 million from the Community Change grant to monitor and address outdoor and indoor air pollution, develop a community solar program, and minimize heat island effects by planting 1,500 trees. The City of Springfield is a named plaintiff in the litigation.

The coalition notes that EPA’s mass cancellation of the environmental and climate justice grant program violates clear congressional mandates and fundamental constitutional principles. Congress directed the EPA to distribute these funds using mandatory language in the Inflation Reduction Act, leaving the agency no discretion to unilaterally withdraw support. The coalition is urging the court to grant plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and ensure that the environmental justice grants remain available for the communities that so desperately need them.

Joining AG Campbell in filing this brief, which she co-led with the attorneys general of New York and California, are the attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

Carbon capture and clean fuels The bill tightens conditions for Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture.","The signing of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBB Act) by President Donald Trump on 4 July marks a pivotal shift in the United States’ climate and energy trajectory.

The sweeping legislation dismantles much of the clean energy incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), while expanding support for fossil fuel activities.

The act radically alters tax credit timelines and access, setting off a rush among developers to start construction before new deadlines in 2025 and 2026.

As the US exits international climate commitments and rolls back green energy support, local governments, clean tech firms and sustainability advocates face heightened uncertainty.

Stepping back from clean energy commitments

Under the new legislation, technology-neutral tax credits for power and storage projects are set to decline steeply.

Solar and wind projects that begin construction by 31 December 2025 can avoid new restrictions, such as those targeting Chinese equipment under the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules.

Projects that start by 4 July 2026 are exempt from a hard deadline to be in service by the end of 2027, but any that fail to start by then must be operational by 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

The tax credit phase-outs are stark: after 2027, wind and solar projects lose access to both the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) unless they meet stringent conditions.

According to Princeton University, this rollback could reduce new wind and solar capacity by 70 GW by 2030, raising household energy costs by US$165 per year and slashing emissions reductions from a target of 40% to just 3%.

Charging infrastructure at risk

The EV sector is hit particularly hard.

The Commercial Clean Vehicle Tax Credit (Section 45W), which provided US$7,500 to US$40,000 per vehicle, is repealed for vehicles acquired after 30 September 2025.

This change affects electrification efforts across municipal fleets, including school buses, public works vehicles and police cars.

Similarly, the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit, supporting EV and hydrogen charging stations, is phased out for installations not in service by 30 June 2026.

This undermines efforts to build out the charging networks necessary to support growing electric mobility.

On the consumer side, incentives like the Section 30D Clean Vehicle Tax Credit and Section 25E Used Clean Vehicle Credit will also expire in September 2025.

Princeton analysis estimates this could result in eight million fewer EVs sold this decade.

Hydrogen and fuel cells

Hydrogen sees its own deadline advance.

Projects must now be under construction by the end of 2027 to qualify for the Section 45V hydrogen production credit of up to US$3/kg – five years earlier than under the IRA.

Fuel cell projects, however, gain an exemption from emissions tests and labour requirements to qualify for a 30% ITC, but only if construction begins after 2025.

Unfortunately, those starting in 2025 fall into a legislative gap, qualifying for neither legacy nor new credits.

Energy storage and geothermal

Battery storage and geothermal projects retain tax credit access at full value through 2033, phasing down in 2034 and 2035.

However, like solar and wind, these technologies face compliance with FEOC rules from January 2026.

Given China’s dominance in battery supply chains, navigating these restrictions will be challenging.

Geothermal may fare better due to a more domestic supply base, making it a more viable option for municipalities looking to deploy low-carbon heating and cooling systems.

Legal complexity

FEOC provisions bar projects and companies from claiming tax credits if they rely heavily on Chinese equipment, financing or technology agreements that amount to “effective control” by foreign entities of concern (including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea).

While the rules officially take effect in 2026, their lack of clarity is already causing anxiety among developers.

Taxpayers and local governments alike must now trace supply chains more rigorously than ever, or risk losing tax credit eligibility.

Carbon capture and clean fuels

The bill tightens conditions for Section 45Q tax credits for carbon capture.

Projects must now meet narrower definitions and avoid ties to foreign entities.

Credit values remain at US$85 per tonne for permanent sequestration and US$60 for reuse, but scope is limited.

Section 45Z clean fuel tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable fuels are extended through 2029, though SAF credits drop to US$1/gal from 2026.

Fuel feedstocks must come exclusively from North America, and complex accounting rules block credits for fuels already benefiting from other tax incentives.

Residential and community impact

The OBBB Act repeals several residential clean energy incentives, including:

Section 25D rooftop solar credits, ending 31 December 2025

Section 25C home energy efficiency credits, ending 31 December 2025

Section 179D commercial efficiency deductions, ending 30 June 2026

Section 45L new energy-efficient home credits, also ending 30 June 2026.

Without these, local homeowners and businesses lose incentives to invest in decarbonisation.

The US Congress has passed the budget reconciliation bill, the “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The budget includes massive cuts to clean energy spending, including early sunsets of clean energy tax credits.

Under the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, solar and wind energy projects were offered a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) or an electricity generation output-based Production Tax Credit (PTC), with a phase-out of the credits beginning in 2032.

Now, under the new budget, solar and wind projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, are not eligible for the credits. The budget also cut the 30% residential solar and home energy efficiency upgrade tax credit, making projects ineligible if they are not placed in service by the end of this year.

The bill also placed steeper requirements for a tax credit adder for projects containing US domestic content, increased restrictions on content from countries designated as foreign entities of concern (FEOC) and cut the electric vehicle tax credit, among many other changes. Other zero-emission technologies such as geothermal, nuclear and hydrogen are set to be phased out in 2032, unchanged by the bill.

The bill marks an early end to what was expected to be a long-term clean energy industrial policy, one that was backed by representatives from both sides of the aisle. Despite an “all the above” approach US President Donald Trump said he supported on the campaign trail and in the president’s early days in office, the administration and Congress have targeted solar, wind and electric vehicles as targets of budget cuts.

Congress has turned its back on the very industries that are adding the majority of the new electricity generating capacity to the grid.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO, Solar Energy Industries Association

“America is in the midst of an energy manufacturing boom, with new solar and storage factories opening across the country thanks to the forward-looking policy this law will upend. Now many of these brand new factories will be forced to shut down and lay off thousands of workers, gutting communities that were finally seeing the kind of industrial revival rural America needs and handing an untimely and strategic victory to China.”

Mike Carr, executive director, Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition

“By rapidly sunsetting demand incentives, Congress is pulling the rug out from under manufacturers, disrupting the reshoring process that is well underway, and conceding the market to China in one year, when the runway of the domestic content incentive ends.”

Jeff Cramer, president and chief executive officer, Coalition for Community Solar Access

“By voting for this bill, Congress chose to raise energy prices, put at risk thousands of energy projects already under development, destabilize investor confidence in energy markets, and put hundreds of thousands of American jobs at risk. This bill rewrites long-standing tax policy and layers on immediate, punitive sourcing requirements.”

Heather O’Neill, chief executive officer, Advanced Energy United

“Even without support from the federal government, state leaders must take steps to ensure we keep the lights on and manage costs. With the right policy direction, governors, legislators, and regulators can take the lead on removing the barriers to building a better electric grid, and lowering costs to build and operate advanced energy. To unlock new development, policymakers can make it easier and more financially enticing for consumers to switch to more resilient energy solutions at their homes and businesses, they can speed up timelines for new energy infrastructure projects by fixing antiquated siting and permitting rules, and they can put more technology solutions to work with much needed changes to energy market regulations.”

Mark Drajem, Natural Resources Defense Council

“This Trump energy tax will cost electricity customers billions of dollars in higher bills. And costs for things like cleaner cars, solar energy and efficient air conditioners will skyrocket. Oil executives, industrial loggers and coal CEOs can all celebrate today as they gain unprecedented access to drill, log and mine on our public lands. The rest of us will soon find no trespassing signs on lands that have belonged to all of us for more than a century.”

Ray Long, chief executive officer, American Council on Renewable Energy

“Despite this setback, the clean energy industry remains committed to building the future. We’re already driving more than $300 billion in private investment, delivering reliable power, and creating jobs in every region of the country.

Jeanne Shaheen speaks in Peterborough about loss of energy credits,DAVID ALLEN,,,,,https://www.ledgertranscript.com/Shaheen-Discusses-Trump-s-Bill-62131563,"One day after urging her U.S. Senate colleagues to renew support for energy efficiency and clean energy tax credits, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen lamented how these are not widespread priorities among her fellow legislators.
Specifically, her proposal would have maintained four tax incentives: the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, the Residential Clean Energy Credit, the New Energy Efficient Home Credit and the Energy Efficient Commercial Building Deduction.
Lindsay Bourgoine of ReVision Energy, a solar and heat pump firm in northern New England, called having tax credits for solar installations pulled “devastating.
Shaheen told a personal story of how tax credits helped her family build a green home in 1979.
“We installed a triple-pane window and a furnace that could burn wood and garbage as well as oil, thanks to tax credits,” she said.","One day after urging her U.S. Senate colleagues to renew support for energy efficiency and clean energy tax credits, New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen lamented how these are not widespread priorities among her fellow legislators.

“There’s a sentiment in Washington that we shouldn’t be subsidizing alternative forms of energy, but we’ve been subsidizing the oil and gas industries as long as I can remember,” said Shaheen Wednesday. She spoke to town officials, business leaders and green energy advocates at a forum at Peterborough Town Library.

A day earlier in the Senate, she asked her colleagues to support her amendment to the Trump administration's “Big Beautiful Bill” to preserve tax credits and energy efficiency initiatives.

“A vote for this amendment is a vote to make energy and housing more affordable and support American jobs and businesses. Last year, these credits helped build 350,000 new efficient homes that save families about $450 a year on energy,” said Shaheen July 1.

Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only two Republican senators who voted for her amendment, and it did not pass. After the Senate passed the bill, the House of Representatives passed it Thursday, and President Donald Trump signed it the next day.

“For the many Granite State families who are worried about energy costs, the ‘Big Beautiful Betrayal’ only promises more pain. To give tax breaks to billionaires and corporations, Republicans are cutting highly effective tax credits that help people save money on their utility bills by making home energy efficiency updates,” stated Shaheen. “I heard from businesses and town leaders about so many successful energy projects that are already delivering cost savings for taxpayers. Now, future projects are on the chopping block, and good paying jobs will be lost because of this bill.”

In Peterborough, Shaheen said that the lack of support for these initiatives showed not only a lack of understanding of environmental realities, but also of economics.

“These credits create good jobs in a sector that is growing at twice the rate of jobs in the overall economy. If we vote to adopt this amendment, we can keep that job creation going,” she said prior to the vote on her amendment.

Specifically, her proposal would have maintained four tax incentives: the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, the Residential Clean Energy Credit, the New Energy Efficient Home Credit and the Energy Efficient Commercial Building Deduction. They are in current law, and were created with bipartisan support.

“The (Republican) majority in the Senate and the administration have not been responsive,” she said when asked about garnering bipartisan support for such programs.

Lindsay Bourgoine of ReVision Energy, a solar and heat pump firm in northern New England, called having tax credits for solar installations pulled “devastating. I’m based in Maine, but we employ 100 Granite Staters,” she said, explaining the end of the credit will prompt some people to refrain from installing solar in their residences.

Shaheen told a personal story of how tax credits helped her family build a green home in 1979.

“We installed a triple-pane window and a furnace that could burn wood and garbage as well as oil, thanks to tax credits,” she said.

Peterborough Town Administrator Nicole MacStay said that the defeat of Shaheen’s amendment is “very disappointing” at the municipal level.

“Losing tax credits will hinder our development of alternative energies. We’re reliant on outside sources for it, and not developing our own will keep us from being energy independent,” said MacStay.

Dori Drachman of the Peterborough Renewable Energy Project said that concerns about the political process nationally prompt concerns over green efforts to address climate change.

“We’re facing two crises here; if we can’t fix our democracy, we’re not going to be able to fix the climate,” said Drachman.

In response, Shaheen said that any approach to generating support for initiatives must be widespread.

“My new mantra is ‘call everybody’ — local officials, people at the state level, business leaders, even people in other states,” she said.

Shaheen noted how efforts at the state level can make a difference.

“When Maine Gov. Janet Mills came into office (in 2019) both her state and ours were using 1% of alternative energy statewide. Now Maine is at 11%, and we’re still at 1%. Leadership matters,” she said.

The impact of the Republican-sponsored legislation will have a clear and specific impact in New Hampshire, Shaheen said.

“Under the Senate-passed version of the budget bill, 17 million Americans would lose health care coverage including more than 46,000 Granite Staters,” she said prior to the reconciled version of the bill clearing the House Thursday.

“This bill doesn’t mostly benefit the top 1% of income earners in the nation, but the top 0.1%,” she said, adding that its lack of inclusion of green initiatives could hurt New Hampshire manufacturers. “Our biggest export is aerospace-related. I was at the Paris Air Show last month, and we heard that firms there were looking at Europe for industrial partners, not us.”

Shaheen is also pushing legislation for energy circuit riders that “help small towns and rural communities make improvements to become more energy efficient, reduce emissions and lower their energy bills.”

She offered a hint of optimism for those opposing the administration’s priorities.

“In some cases of history, governments have experienced no backlash from their efforts. But here last month, you had between four and six million people at ‘No Kings’ rallies across the country,” she said.",https://www.ledgertranscript.com//attachments/15/51029815.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 14:20:35.985242

But the Senate’s version of the bill that ultimately was adopted has language allowing Ford to still qualify for the credits.
The Biden-era production credits offer $35 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells and $10 per kilowatt-hour for battery modules or pack assembly.
Chinese company involvement The House version barred the credits from going toward projects that involve a licensing agreement with a foreign entity of concern, which includes CATL.
If anything, we want to go faster.” The project has been criticized by some nationally and locally for involving a Chinese company.","Ford Motor Co. said it will continue building its $3 billion battery plant in Marshall, Mich., after President Donald Trump’s newly enacted $3.4 trillion budget legislation retained key production tax credits that an earlier proposal by Congress would have eliminated.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” the company said in a July 8 statement. “BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit — a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

Executives in May said the project would be in peril if a bill passed by the House of Representatives was adopted into law because it would have disqualified Ford from receiving Biden-era production tax credits because of its affiliation with Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited. But the Senate’s version of the bill that ultimately was adopted has language allowing Ford to still qualify for the credits.

The 2-million-square-foot plant about 100 miles west of Detroit is slated to open in 2026 to make lithium iron phosphate batteries for future EVs using some intellectual property from CATL. The facility is a key piece of Ford’s efforts to create affordable EVs to rival Chinese companies such as BYD.

The Biden-era production credits offer $35 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells and $10 per kilowatt-hour for battery modules or pack assembly. Ford says the site has the capacity to produce 20 gigawatt-hours per year.

Chinese company involvement

The House version barred the credits from going toward projects that involve a licensing agreement with a foreign entity of concern, which includes CATL. The final Senate-drafted version uses criteria about which party is in “effective control.”

Ford has maintained it is in control because it owns the site, equipment and workers. CATL will train the workers on battery cell manufacturing as well as how to use the equipment.

The automaker stepped up its lobbying efforts in June as the bill was making its way through Congress, sending plant managers, manufacturing leaders and dealers to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

Credits are lifeline to Marshall plant site

Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of technology platform programs and electric vehicle systems, told reporters in June that the tax credits had became a lifeline to the site amid slowing EV adoption rates and it would be unfair to take away incentives that were promised when the project began.

“Because our timeline for investment is so long, when these rules change so fast, they’re very material for us,” Drake said in June. “We don’t want to back off on this facility. If anything, we want to go faster.”

The project has been criticized by some nationally and locally for involving a Chinese company.

Ford originally committed to investing $3.5 billion and employing 2,500 workers when it announced the project in early 2023. It stopped work in September 2023 to reassess its “ability to competitively operate the plant” and downscaled the plan before resuming construction a few months later.

Ford says the LFP batteries the plant will make charge faster, last longer and cost less than other types. The company has said it will launch an electric midsize pickup in 2027 on a new low-cost platform, although it has not yet confirmed that the truck would use cells from the Marshall plant.

Air monitoring equipment near the beach on Grand Isle, La.

Eric Vance | U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

(The Center Square) − The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has approved a long-pending air quality plan submitted by Louisiana, determining that the state is not significantly contributing to sulfur dioxide pollution in other states under federal clean air rules.

The approval, finalized late last month and effective on Aug. 6, applies to a portion of Louisiana's State Implementation Plan under the Clean Air Act's ""Good Neighbor"" provision, which requires states to prevent their air emissions from causing nonattainment of federal air standards in downwind states.

""EPA determines that the Louisiana SIP contains adequate provisions to ensure that the air emissions in the state will not significantly contribute to nonattainment or interfere with maintenance"" of the 2010 1-hour SO₂ National Ambient Air Quality Standard, the agency wrote in its final rule.

The EPA's approval of Louisiana's plan may also mark one of the final actions under the ""Good Neighbor"" policy. On March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would terminate the program as part of what he called ""the greatest day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

Zeldin argued that the program ""expanded federal rules to more states and sectors beyond the program's traditional focus"" and led to widespread rejection of state-submitted air plans. It's unclear how the rollback will affect already-approved SIPs, including Louisiana's.

The decision is the result of a 12-year review process. Louisiana originally submitted its SIP revision in 2013 to address the interstate transport obligations tied to sulfur dioxide, a pollutant primarily emitted by industrial sources such as power plants and refineries.

The ruling drew praise from the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which submitted formal comments urging EPA to finalize the decision.

According to the ruling, the LPSC said the decision, ""supports cooperative federalism, preserves the LPSC's authority to regulate retail electric rates and services, and avoids the reliability and cost challenges associated with federal mandates.""

The EPA also received public comments in support of the rule from an anonymous commenter and a Louisiana resident. One citizen applauded the agency's continued enforcement of the Clean Air Act and warned against rolling back interstate pollution protections.

The ruling does not include the actual comments.

Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas linked to respiratory problems, especially in children and older adults. But the EPA concluded that Louisiana's current emissions controls — while not specified in the rule — are sufficient to avoid causing pollution problems in neighboring states.

The action does not impose any new regulations beyond what the state already has on the books. In its response, EPA emphasized that its role is to approve state-submitted plans so long as they meet Clean Air Act standards, not to rewrite or add to them.

Environmental advocates may scrutinize the decision in light of Louisiana's industrial footprint and ongoing air quality concerns in regions like Cancer Alley.

Any challenges to the final rule must be filed in federal court by Sept. 5 under the Clean Air Act",https://www.catahoulanewsbooster.com/sites/catahoulanewsbooster.com/files/2025-07/epa%20.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 14:21:20.499941

Since commencing operations in 2022, the partners have worked together to support San Antonio’s transition to a low-carbon future -- transforming methane-rich landfill gas into home-grown RNG for Texans and helping power VIA’s fleet of compressed natural gas buses, CPS Energy noted.

Republic Services Tessman Road Landfill sends 5,700 standard cubic feet per minute of gas to the RNG facility, captured from a network of 265 gas recovery wells.

“Our vision is to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world now and for future generations,” said Republic Services General Manager Bill Rich. “Through partnerships like these, we are converting the community’s waste into a lower-carbon fuel source that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and brings us closer to our goal of beneficially reusing 50 percent more of our biogas by 2030.”

Gas generated by decomposing organic materials is captured from the landfill and processed into RNG by EDL. The quantities of RNG produced at Tessman Road are enough to displace about seven million gallons of diesel each year when used in transport.

The RNG produced at the facility is added to CPS Energy’s existing pipeline network for delivery to end users.

“This first-of-its-kind RNG project for CPS Energy highlights our strategy to think globally and act locally to bring innovative solutions to our community,” said Rudy Garza, President & CEO, CPS Energy. “Integrating this RNG gas delivery system is key to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions in the Greater San Antonio area and is making a positive impact in our city.

For more than fifty years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. Today’s announcement builds on the success of NYSERDA’s Grid Modernization program, which since 2016 has awarded approximately $65 million to over 110 grid technology companies and research organizations for projects that improve low-cost high-accuracy grid sensors, modeling and simulation tools, and advanced engineering solutions. New York State’s investments in research, development, and commercialization support innovators accelerating the clean energy transition. NYSERDA’s Innovation and Research program is deploying approximately $1.2 billion over 15 years as direct research investments and commercialization support. To date, more than $800 million in investments have supported more than 700 companies and made nearly 300 products commercially available to individuals, businesses, and utilities.

In addition, New York State is investing nearly $3 billion in electrifying its transportation sector and rapidly advancing measures that all new passenger cars and trucks sold, are zero emissions, along with all school buses being zero emissions the same year. There are a range of initiatives to grow access to EVs and improve clean transit for all New Yorkers including the Drive Clean Rebate, EV Make Ready, EVolve NY, the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (NYTVIP), the New York School Bus Incentive Program, and the Direct Current Fast Charger Program.

Funding for this initiative is through the Clean Energy Fund (CEF).",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2022-04/Electricchargingstations.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=eEbciDJ2,N,,2025-07-08 13:40:49.473379

Without these funds to bring some price parity to the EV market, there are concerns that the machines will no longer be affordable for average car buyers.
I think, truly, the first time where it's like an undeniable, well-engineered product at that price point.","Since returning to office earlier this year, President Donald Trump has not made life easy on automotive executives. The auto industry has faced rapid changes from both trade and domestic policy decisions, which could have long-lasting and substantial impacts on the market here in the United States.

No segment has faced scrutiny quite like EVs — but the moves don’t necessarily hurt the brands you’d expect. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said that while he doesn’t agree with the moves made by the administration, the impact could actually be positive for Rivian on the whole.

“Honestly, I think the policy changes are bad for the world, bad for the U.S., because I think it takes away some of the tail ends that are necessary for us to maintain global leadership in technology and what is undoubtedly the end state and future state,” Scaringe told reporters during a recent media event. “But I think for Rivian, it's probably a good thing from a competitive landscape point of view.""

""Because you see all the incumbents, they're the biggest adversaries in policy. All the work that we're trying to do to even get it to just be fair game, things like vehicle registration costs — the folks we spend the most energy fighting against in D.C. are actually car companies. So that's very, very telling, because it's reflective of their desire — which is that this whole EV thing would just go away. And that's actually really bad for them.”

Following Trump’s signature on the Big Beautiful Bill on July 4, the federal government will no longer offer tax credits tied to the purchase of an electric vehicle after September. Without these funds to bring some price parity to the EV market, there are concerns that the machines will no longer be affordable for average car buyers. That puts automakers in a rather tricky spot, as the development and production of those vehicles has required massive investments. Other markets have not softened their stance on EV adoption, either, which means those cars will have to be developed either way.

That said, Scaringe believes Trump’s adjusted strategy will ultimately lead to a worse market for buyers as automakers choose not to incentivize EV sales or development.

“I think in 2030, we're going to have an even worse situation than we have today in terms of lack of choice and lack of competition,” said Scaringe. “I say this all the time. I think the biggest challenge to get electric vehicle adoption from 8% to 20% is — we need choice. Take Tesla Model 3 and Model Y; great products, but they're not what everybody wants. Meaning it's not that they're not anything bad about them. It's just not everybody wants the same form factor, with the same sort of product trade-offs and decisions and brand positioning.""

If the EV market is to see significant growth, Scaringe said, it needs to expand to 300-plus great choices, many of which need to be more affordable — yet today, that sub-$50,000 EV market is dominated by the Model 3 and Model Y. ""Tesla ... this massive market share they have is not a reflection of a healthy market,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of a lack of choice.”

But with the brand set to expand its lineup soon with the more affordable R2, Scaringe believes Rivian will be well-positioned to benefit from a market where other automakers back away from EV development.

“[It] couldn't be better situation for R2 to be launching into,"" he said, ""where, for the first time, I think customers that want to spend $50,000 are going to have a real [alternative] ... not to say it's trying to compete with Tesla in the same brand position, but at the same price point, you'll have a real alternative. I think, truly, the first time where it's like an undeniable, well-engineered product at that price point. And I wish there was five or six of those.”","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rivian-ceo-robert-rj-scaringe-speaks-at-the-launch-of-the-news-photo-1751988160.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-07-08 13:35:44.802611

They succeeded by adding deeply controversial cuts in Medicaid to help fund the tax cuts and by changing the way Congress scores revenue measures to make their bill appear relatively costless even though it would reduce federal revenues by nearly $4.5 trillion over the next decade.

But all that effort may all be for naught. Historically, controversial tax changes rarely are permanent. And that may be especially true for the Senate’s efforts.

Not what you think

On paper, the argument for permanent investment incentives is sound, especially if the goal is to boost long-term investment. Businesses can’t project the true return on their investments without knowing how they’d be taxed in the future. Absent such tax stability, they are reluctant to make these purchases, weakening the economic benefit of the tax breaks.

But in Congress, the declared lifespan of tax changes may not mean what you think. Lawmakers have a long history of repeatedly extending temporary tax breaks. And, as described below, they rewrite what start out as permanent tax provisions almost as often.

Limited shelf life

Among the reasons: Tax changes enacted on a strictly partisan basis, such as the current budget bill, have a limited shelf life. Should Democrats take control of Washington, many of these business tax breaks would be in jeopardy.

Lawmakers may be under added pressure because this massive budget bill is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the federal debt that already was expected to top $52 trillion in a decade. In that environment, it is a good bet that taxes will have to be increased, just as spending must be cut.

As a result of GOP budget cuts and Trump Administration staff reductions, the IRS has limited capacity to write regulations or enforce the laws. This may amplify the public perception (and perhaps the reality) that corporations are gaming the tax system, giving Democrats leverage to repeal, or at least scale back, some corporate tax breaks.

But the main reason the budget bill’s tax provisions likely will not be permanent is that the tax law is evanescent. But the political system creates incentives for lobbyists and lawmakers alike to change tax laws. Just as stock traders need volatility to thrive, so does the political system.

A history of change

Just think about the history of major tax bills.

Congress substantially rewrote the federal income tax code in 1954 and 1969. Then President Reagan drove Congress to adopt his historic 1981 tax cuts.

But, with even the White House worried about deficits, Congress largely undid them with tax increases in 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1987. Some provisions of the largely partisan ’81 bill were repealed before they even took effect, and the 1982 rewrite was among the largest tax increases in modern US history.

In 1986, Reagan engineered a widely praised fundamental rewrite of the federal tax code that passed with broad bipartisan support. But it didn’t take long for Congress to rewrite even some of its most important elements.

For example, the ’86 Act cut the top individual income tax rate to 28 percent. It lasted less than five years. In 1991, Congress raised the top rate to 31 percent. By 1993, it was 39.6 percent.

That top rate survived nine years, a lifetime in tax policy. But in 2001, at the urging of President Bush, Congress lowered the rate to 35 percent. By 2012, it was back to 39.6 percent. Five years later, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act trimmed it to 37 percent.

The on-again, off-again investment credit

Corporate taxes are not immune. Take, for example, the investment tax credit (ITC) that allows firms to immediately write off a share of their capital costs. In 1962, Congress enacted what it called a permanent 7 percent credit. In 1964, Congress kept the rate but liberalized the rules. In 1966, it temporarily suspended the credit, before restoring it in 1967, and repealing it in 1969. In 1971, President Nixon, who had called for repeal two years earlier, convinced Congress to bring the credit back on a temporary basis, but at a 10 percent rate.

The ’81 law created a new way for businesses to depreciate the cost of their plant and equipment. That system lasted for five years, before the ’86 Act created yet another depreciation plan.

Today, most remaining investment credits are limited to green energy equipment. And the budget bill would repeal them. Yet, the broader, permanent expensing provisions in the new Senate bill are, in a sense, step-grandchildren of the old ITC.

The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the permanent business provisions of the bill would increase the deficit about $700 billion over 10 years

Acknowledging the true 10-year cost of these tax benefits is a sound fiscal decision. But businesses would take the bill’s promise of perpetual tax treatment at their own peril. In the words of Willie Nelson, “Nothing lasts forever but old Fords and a natural stone.”",https://taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_768x256/public/2025-07/getty-images-nqpbgvhLUIc-unsplash.jpeg?h=610c6df8&itok=Q-nn3JT2,N,,2025-07-08 13:33:55.495438

The Green Metals Battery Innovations joint venture will be a separate operation from Toyota Tsusho's primary production focus on “sustainable and innovative recycling and waste handling” at the Toyota Battery Manufacturing N.C. plant in Liberty.

Participating is LG Energy Solution Michigan, a U.S. division of LG Energy Solution of Seoul, a global manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, mobility, information technology and energy storage systems. Toyota Tsusho owns 51% of the joint venture.

Production is scheduled to begin in late 2025 at the 4043 Reynolds Court plant within the revamped Whitaker Park campus. Toyota Tsusho America paid $13.7 million for the 110,163-square-foot speculative building.

The joint venture will extract black mass, a key material for battery recycling that contains raw metals such as nickel, cobalt and lithium.

The black mass materials are extracted through dismantling and shredding battery production scrap. In the initial stage, LG Energy Solution Michigan will supply scrap generated during the production of EV batteries for Toyota at the Liberty plant.

""The joint venture seeks to further establish a battery-to-battery closed-loop system where those raw materials are circulated as recycled resources for new battery materials, advancing a true circular economy in the battery supply chain,"" the companies said.

The facility is expected to reach an annual processing capacity of 13,500 tons of scrap, equivalent to more than 40,000 automotive batteries.

Toyota Tsusho is expected to house the materials at the Liberty plant, where it projects running two weekday shifts where it has 41 employees.

In February 2024, Toyota Tsusho announced a joint venture with Fujihatsu & Toyotsu Battery Components N.C. on a $60 million plant near the Liberty plant that will feature 133 jobs at full production. The joint venture is 60% owned by Fujihatsu.

Production is scheduled to begin in 2025 with initial production volume to be 2.7 million units per month.

During President Trump’s first term, Dr. Koonin proposed that the Environmental Protection Agency conduct a “red-team, blue-team” exercise to challenge mainstream climate science.
A “red team” of climate skeptics would critique major scientific reports on global warming, and a “blue team” of climate scientists would then rebut these claims.
Dr. Koonin also serves as a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning research organization on Stanford University’s campus.
Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, expressed alarm that the Energy Department had hired the three scientists.","The Energy Department has hired at least three scientists who are well-known for their rejection of the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, according to records reviewed by The New York Times.

The scientists are listed in the Energy Department’s internal email system as current employees of the agency, the records show. They are Steven E. Koonin, a physicist and author of a best-selling book that calls climate science “unsettled”; John Christy, an atmospheric scientist who doubts the extent to which human activity has caused global warming; and Roy Spencer, a meteorologist who believes that clouds have had a greater influence on warming than humans have.

Their hiring comes after the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been compiling the federal government’s flagship report on how climate change is affecting the country. The administration has also systematically removed mentions of climate change from government websites while slashing federal funding for research on global warming.

In addition, Trump officials have been recruiting scientists to help them repeal the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which determined that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare, and which now underpins much of the government’s legal authority to slow global warming, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

It was not immediately clear what the three scientists were working on or whether they were being paid. Representatives for Dr. Koonin, Dr. Spencer and the Energy Department did not respond to requests for comment.

In a brief phone interview and follow-up email, Dr. Christy said he was not working on the endangerment finding nor collecting a government salary. He declined to comment further.

A vast majority of scientists around the world agree that human activities — primarily the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal — are dangerously heating the Earth. That has increased the frequency and intensity of heat waves, droughts and colossal bursts of rain like the storm that caused the deadly flooding now devastating central Texas.

A small minority of scientists, however, rejects this consensus. Dr. Koonin, who has said he is a friend of Energy Secretary Chris Wright, has been one of the loudest critics.

During President Trump’s first term, Dr. Koonin proposed that the Environmental Protection Agency conduct a “red-team, blue-team” exercise to challenge mainstream climate science. A “red team” of climate skeptics would critique major scientific reports on global warming, and a “blue team” of climate scientists would then rebut these claims. At the time, mainstream climate scientists said the proposal would make a mockery of scientific research and create a platform for marginal views that had already been disproved in the normal course of scientific debate.

Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator at the time, told coal industry executives that he planned to conduct the exercise. But John F. Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, ultimately blocked the effort.

Now, Dr. Koonin is listed as a “special government employee” in the Energy Department’s internal email system, the records show. Federal law says special government employees are executive branch appointees named to “perform important, but limited, services to the government, with or without compensation, for a period not to exceed 130 days” during a one-year period. Elon Musk had that classification when he began Mr. Trump’s cost cutting initiative, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

Dr. Koonin also serves as a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative-leaning research organization on Stanford University’s campus. He previously worked as a physicist at New York University, a scientist for the oil and gas company BP and an under secretary at the Energy Department during the Obama administration.

In his 2021 book, “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t and Why It Matters,” Dr. Koonin argued that while the planet was warming and human activities had played a role, the scientific consensus was not as certain or as dire as it was frequently portrayed.

In a phone interview in November, Dr. Koonin said that the book had made an impression on Mr. Wright, who ran the oil and gas company Liberty Energy before he was confirmed as energy secretary in February.

“He reached out when I wrote the book and said, ‘This is great,’” Dr. Koonin recalled. “He asked me to come talk to his company at one point — it was a couple years ago — and we got to know each other.”

He added, “Chris and I have talked quite a bit over the last couple years, and I think he is well aligned with what I wrote in the book.”

Dr. Spencer, a research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, also has a connection to Mr. Wright. In a report published last year by Liberty Energy, Mr. Wright cited atmospheric temperature records that Dr. Spencer had collected. (The overall report, titled “Bettering Human Lives,” made the case that fossil fuels were “essential” to solving global poverty, a claim that some experts have called misleading.)

In addition to his role at the University of Alabama, Dr. Spencer is a policy adviser at the Heartland Institute, a conservative group that rejects mainstream climate science. He previously served as a scientist at NASA and as a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing group responsible for creating Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for the new administration.

Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, expressed alarm that the Energy Department had hired the three scientists.

“What this says is that the administration has no respect for the actual science, which overwhelmingly points in the direction of a growing crisis as we continue to warm the planet through fossil-fuel burning, the consequences of which we’ve seen play out in recent weeks in the form of deadly heat domes and floods here in the U.S.,” Dr. Mann wrote in an email.

Dr. Mann added that the Trump administration appeared to have fired hundreds of “actual government science experts” and replaced them with “a small number of reliable foot soldiers.”

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, said it would be troubling if these three scientists were involved in repealing the 2009 endangerment finding, which cleared the way for the government to regulate the planet-warming gases emitted by cars, power plants and other industrial sources.

On his first day back in the White House, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that charged the E.P.A. with reviewing the “legality and continuing applicability of” the endangerment finding. And last week, the agency sent a proposal to reconsider the finding to the White House budget office, a first step in repealing it.

What do you think about the EVs subsidies cut?","Electric cars incentives at risk! The recent approval in the U.S. Senate of the One Big Beautiful Bill, brought by the U.S. President Donald Trump, is key for the country’s environmental and fiscal policy. With the decisive vote of Vice President JD Vance, this new legislation proposes the elimination of tax credits for electric vehicles established under the Inflation Reduction Act. Due to this situation, many sectors that promote sustainable mobility are concerned.

Researchers at MIT and the University of Michigan have highlighted the importance of these subsidies in reducing emissions from the transportation sector, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In addition, data from Kelley Blue Book show that, although EV prices have been falling, tax incentives remain key to making them more accessible to the public. So, let’s learn more about this new legislation.

One Big Beautiful Bill

A new bill promoted by Donald Trump and passed by the U.S. Senate would eliminate federal tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs). If the legislation also passes in the House of Representatives, the incentives that make it more affordable to buy EVs would disappear on September 30, 2025.

This change is part of a large tax and public spending bill, and will affect both buyers and the future of electric mobility in the country.

Subsidies disappearing

Currently, electric car buyers in the U.S. receive two types of tax credits, but they could stop enjoying this aid very soon. Let’s see what are there types of subsidies:

$7,500 when purchasing or leasing a new electric vehicle.

$4,000 when purchasing a used electric vehicle.

These subsidies were created to make EVs more attractive to consumers. I mean, people are used to gasoline or diesel cars, so if electric ones are more expensive there’s no point for lower and mid-sized classes to buy them. That’s why these subsidies are important to introduce green cars to as many citizens as possible. Unfortunately, these two benefits won’t exist after September 30, 2025.

Importance of these credits

As we mentioned before, EVs tend to be more expensive than gasoline cars, but let’s see this situation with a clear example and numbers: In May 2025, a new EV cost on average $57,700, while a gasoline car cost $48,100. On the other hand, used cars showed a smaller difference: $36,000 for a used EV versus $34,000 for a gasoline one.

Researchers at the University of Michigan stated in 2024 that these credits are crucial to accelerating the point at which an EV becomes more cost-effective than an internal combustion car.

EVs and their positive contribution to the world

One of the reasons these subsidies were created was to reduce pollution from the transportation sector, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the U.S. (28% of the total, according to the Environmental Protection Agency).

Electric cars do not emit tailpipe gases, as they do not burn gasoline. Although pollution is generated in the manufacturing and charging of the vehicle, studies by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) conclude that EVs are still “clearly better for the climate” even considering these indirect emissions.

More EVS are expected to be bought this summer

According to expert Ingrid Malmgren, of the Plug In America organization, this will be “the summer of the electric car,” because many people will try to buy one before the benefit ends.

In addition, Malmgren advises that, if someone is going to buy an EV in the next few months, they should take advantage of the tax credit at the time of purchase (at the dealership), rather than waiting to claim it when filing their tax return the following year.

As you can see, we never know what’s going to happen with new things coming to us. EVs were the talk of the town and so promising, but now the government of the United States has decided to cut every economic help that allows the increase of purchases. So, we’ll have to wait until this new regulation is finished.

Dive Brief:

Detroit has launcheda drone inspection pilot program for city-owned buildings that can identify energy-saving improvements and optimize performance.

The drones capture visible and thermal imaging of the building; an AI platform developed by Lamarr.AI processes the images and building analytics to create 3D models and energy simulations that help city officials identify thermal inefficiencies, assess structural conditions and optimize potential upgrades.

A partnership among Lamarr.AI, Detroit-based technology incubator Michigan Central and startup venture platform Newlab, the pilot “is a prime example of how public-private collaboration can unlock innovative solutions for cities,” said Tim Slusser, Detroit’s chief mobility officer, in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Detroit, the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan Central and Newlab in 2022 launchedthe Advanced Aerial Innovation Region as a real-world testbed for next-generation drone technologies “to move drone technology from concept to city-scale deployment,” according to a press release.

The number of use cases for drones in city operations is “phenomenally high,” said Matt Whitaker, director of mobility innovation platforms at Michigan Central.

Detroit had already established atransportation innovation zone to streamline permitting for new mobility solutions such as drones, and Michigan Central helped the city get Federal Aviation Administration permissions to fly the drones, Whitaker said.

For this project, Lamarr.AI, working with aerial photographers FlyGuys and drone operations management system Airspace Link,deployed drones to identify thermal deficiencies such as insulation gaps and potential water infiltration in three municipal buildings. It used the data to create 3D models it paired with energy simulations to pinpoint targeted upgrades that could reduce the three buildings’ HVAC energy use by up to 22%, according to the press release.

The final reports give the city a tiered approach to retrofitting the buildings, such as targeted weatherization at the curtain wall, replacement of specific failing windows, continuous wall insulation and roof enhancements.

“We are helping the city of Detroit, through the Office of Sustainability specifically, to identify vulnerabilities for cost and climate challenges,” said Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakha. “Our AI analyzes and categorizes building deficiencies and uses simulation to clearly state the return on investment once we identify an anomaly or a deficiency.”

Rakha said the combination of drones and its AI platform is “20 times faster, five to 10 times more affordable and 50% more accurate than [assessing thermal deficiencies by] regular means — including using drones in general because drones can collect data but not analyze it.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GmCC1vpvblHFWWoUOsj3tfczOxuC36vOt6Fy_wiTzf8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Ecm9uZV9QaG90b18tX0xhbWFycl9JbnNwZWN0aW9uX0RldHJvaXRfMi5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-07-08 13:35:21.915670

After years of shifts towards widespread renewable energy adoption, presidential executive orders are pausing federal investments in new wind and solar projects, slowing the development of clean energy supply chains and manufacturing. The leasing of federal lands for renewables has also been rolled back, limiting the expansion of large-scale projects. In the first quarter of 2025, clean energy manufacturers canceled, closed or downsized nearly $8 billion in projects. Tariffs are also making solar panel installations more expensive, since about 75% of panels come from China.

At the same time, the policy changes benefit the expansion of fossil fuels: they lift restrictions on oil, gas and mineral production in Alaska and expand drilling in places like the Alaska National Wildlife Reserve. These moves open areas for development and revive the natural gas industry, which could pose a risk to wildlife and natural habitats. Simplifying the approval process for natural gas pipelines could also speed up construction, but it might overlook environmental assessments.

Retail energy suppliers are already feeling the effects of increased price volatility and rising compliance costs. To navigate this new reality, suppliers need to focus on three smart strategies: Buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) now, leverage data and predictive analytics to make more informed decisions, and grow market share.

Getting ahead of REC price increases

With fewer renewable projects on the horizon, the supply of RECs is tightening. Yet, state renewable portfolio standards are not going anywhere, and will continue to require retail suppliers to acquire a certain percentage of RECs based on the region and their portfolio size. That supply imbalance, paired with an increased demand, guarantees that prices will go up. The best way for suppliers to mitigate risk is to begin buying RECs now or put money aside to start that process, ahead of projected price increases. Accumulating them gradually spreads financial exposure and ensures inventory is available when needed, and at a lower price.

Some states allow suppliers to hold RECs for months or years before they need to be retired, giving them a chance to build up a stock. Strategically buying RECs in advance, capitalizing during periods of lower pricing, will also help suppliers mitigate the rate increases that are passed on to customers, as prices are expected to rise by the end of this year or early 2026.

It’s also essential to track RECs more proactively than in the past. That doesn’t require new systems, but having visibility into upcoming pricing trends allows suppliers to act when opportunities emerge. Implementing systems to manage and track RECs ensures you’re taking into account all of the information available to make smart decisions.

Leverage predictive analytics and data

Policy changes will also increase price volatility in the natural gas market, making hedging decisions more critical. Suppliers should leverage predictive analytics and data to drive decision-making. Historical trends aren’t enough — predictive analytics proves to be valuable in anticipating swings tied to weather patterns and regulatory shifts. Third-party software and managed services have modernized energy transactions with real-time market data, weather forecasting and load analysis to identify optimal purchase windows and lock in natural gas prices amidst price volatility. Having access to data at this level, with the software to track it, makes the process more transparent and helps suppliers make the most informed hedging decisions, efficiently adjusting market positions based on real-time data.

As policy changes increase natural gas generation and shift away from renewables, suppliers will also need to evaluate their portfolio mix and where they are supplying customers. Determining the most cost-effective and reliable energy sourcing strategy given current regulation may require suppliers to consider greater diversity or reallocation of energy sources in their portfolios. The more granular insights suppliers can use, the easier it will be to optimize portfolios and secure the best mix at the best price.

Increase market share early

Customer-facing technology is another area of opportunity. Smart apps and meters that deliver real-time energy usage data can help customers manage their consumption more effectively. Features like time-of-use pricing offer more transparency for customers to see exactly what the prices are and adjust their energy usage accordingly to reduce their energy costs. This is especially significant with looming rate increases due to REC price changes and compliance costs that may show up on customer bills. These technologies offer customers invaluable insights into their consumption habits and put some of the power in their hands to make their own changes. New product offerings that improve the customer experience have staying power beyond future policy or market changes, and can help ensure suppliers keep their customer share.

As compliance and sourcing costs increase, long-term customer contracts offer stability. One proven approach is structuring power purchase agreements with large, consistent users like data centers. Big technology companies, like Microsoft and Meta, are investing in massive data centers to meet the rapidly growing needs for AI development. While some retail suppliers may have a large variety of customers across residential and commercial sectors, shifting target customer focus to pursue opportunities with large commercial technology users can offer a great balance and reduce risk. These customers have predictable, around-the-clock demand. Agreements with large users offer fixed or indexed pricing over multiple years, giving suppliers a predictable load to hedge against and revenue to plan around. With these long-term PPA agreements, that market share is solidified for years, regardless of any uncertainty in federal regulations.

Building long-term resilience

While some of the current federal orders could be reversed under future administrations, these shifts will take years to fully implement. Restarting shuttered coal or nuclear plants takes time and money, and, in many cases, the talent to do so has already exited the workforce. It would take years for restarted plants to meet current standards and come up to speed.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IspShliRBHyQM2_cW5Ae65uZj1hIAmNBthe5y3du5M4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzM4MjE1MzMzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-08 14:20:39.780198

Moreover, the public largely agreed that the group that stood to benefit most from the bill was high-income earners.
Fifty-five percent of respondents said the bill would help them versus just 11 percent who thought it would hurt them.
Of note, only a plurality of Republicans (49 percent) supported the bill at that time as well.
Twelve percent of Republicans opposed this change while 17 percent of Democrats supported it.","On July 4, as Americans were gathering with family and friends to honor the nation’s 249th birthday, something else happened in Washington, DC: President Trump signed into law his first major legislative accomplishment, the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act. Amidst a busy six months for Trump’s administration, the new law hasn’t received as much attention as many of his executive and foreign policy actions, but it is likely to be a defining part of his second term.

Trump has described the law, which includes a host of provisions related to tax policy, Medicaid, immigration, and more, as “very popular.” Early signals, however, indicate that the president has a long way to go in persuading Americans that the law is good for the country overall—and for them, specifically. In the month leading up to the bill’s final passage, five major polls gauged the public’s attitude about it, which were decisively negative.

Worse still: the share of the public opposing the bill grew as discussion about it ramped up in Congress and it came closer to passing, and polls that restricted their samples to only registered voters showed stronger opposition than those that did not. Below is a look at what we learned from these five polls.

Pew Research

In the Pew Research survey, conducted in early June, 49 percent of respondents opposed the bill. By comparison, 29 percent supported it and 21 percent had no opinion. But more interesting was that the momentum was with the bill’s opponents. Among the 80 percent of Democrats who opposed it, fully 67 percent were “strongly opposed.” Meanwhile, only a slight majority of Republicans (56 percent) supported the bill, and just 25 percent said they “strongly support” it—not especially encouraging numbers for the OBBB’s supporters.

Moreover, the public largely agreed that the group that stood to benefit most from the bill was high-income earners. Fifty-five percent of respondents said the bill would help them versus just 11 percent who thought it would hurt them. By contrast, majorities believed it would hurt middle-income people (51 percent), lower-income people (59 percent), and “people like you” (51 percent). A small majority (51 percent) also feared that the law will have a negative impact on the federal deficit, including even one-third of Republicans.

Pew also gauged the public’s attitudes on five individual measures, and the results here were slightly more mixed. Three of the five received plurality support, including extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that were set to expire at the end of the year (42 percent), increasing SALT deductions (39 percent), and increasing taxes on colleges and universities with large endowments (43 percent). On the other two matters, though, Americans were less sympathetic—pluralities opposed measures to end federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases (42 percent) and for companies producing wind, solar, or nuclear energy (50 percent).

Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF)

The early-June Kaiser Family Foundation survey showed the greatest amount of opposition to the bill of the five polls: 64 percent viewed it unfavorably against 35 percent who viewed it favorably (though notably, it appears the survey question may not have given respondents the option to express no opinion).

The KFF poll was among the more detailed, asking questions about the bill’s myriad components related to healthcare. Among all respondents, 60 percent said they believed cuts to Medicaid are primarily about “taking health care away from people who need it,” including 89 percent of Democrats, 63 percent of independents, and even one-third of Republicans. By contrast, 39 percent believed the cuts will come from “reducing fraud and waste,” including 68 percent of Republicans, 36 percent of independents, and just 11 percent of Democrats.

Medicaid work requirements were popular overall, with 68 percent supporting—including 66 percent of independents and even a small plurality (51 percent) of Democrats—against 32 percent opposing. KFF also tested messaging both for and against these requirements and found:

Support increased to 79 percent if people believed savings would help fund Medicaid for vulnerable groups like the elderly and indigent children;

Support decreased to just 40 percent if they believed the change would have little or no impact on the share of Medicaid enrollees who were working but would increase state administrative costs to oversee program eligibility;

Support decreased to an even lower 35 percent if they believed that most people on Medicaid were either already working or “unable to work because they are either disabled or caring for a family member” and that “such a requirement would put many of them at risk of losing coverage due to the difficulty proving eligibility through required paperwork.”

The Washington Post’s poll, also conducted toward the beginning of June, showed the least amount of opposition to the bill (42 percent), though it had the largest share of respondents with “no opinion” (34 percent, including a plurality—42 percent—of independents). Of note, only a plurality of Republicans (49 percent) supported the bill at that time as well.

Of the five polls, the Post’s was the only one to break down support and opposition to several of the bill’s individual components (15, to be exact). The results were mixed: five of the policies had majority support, two had plurality support, one saw an even split, one had plurality opposition, and six had majority opposition.

The two most popular provisions (polling at over 70 percent support) related to increasing child tax credits and extending tax cuts for individuals making under $100,000 annually. These were also the two policies with by far the most support among Democrats and the top two among independents as well.

Eliminating taxes on tips was also highly popular, with 65 percent support and substantial net support among Democrats (+27) and independents (+40).

The remaining two policies with majority support were both just over 50 percent: extending tax breaks for those earning between $100,000 and $200,000 (53 percent) and adopting Medicaid work requirements (52 percent).

Of the two measures with plurality support, the top one was extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for everyone (including high-income earners), which received 49 percent support, though a quarter of respondents had no opinion on the matter. The other—ending EV tax credits—only had slight net-positive support: 42 percent against 37 percent opposing it, with independents only marginally likelier (+8) to support the change.

Respondents were evenly split on repealing some student loan forgiveness programs. There were wide partisan differences (+40 among Republicans against -43 against Democrats), but even independents were relatively divided, supporting the move by an extremely slim margin (+2).

The remaining measures all had plurality or majority opposition, including among independents. These included boosting military spending (-5), adding $50 million for building more of the southern border wall (-16), extending corporate tax breaks (-19), and ending tax breaks for solar, wind, and geothermal energy (-20). The remaining three provisions were extremely unpopular, with less than 20 percent support and net support of less than 10 points among even Republicans: extending tax breaks for those making more than $400,000 (-22), spending $45 billion to build and maintain new migrant detention centers (-37), and cutting federal funding for food assistance (-43), the last of which was had net-negative support among Republicans.

Fox News

The Fox News poll only asked three questions about the bill, but they surveyed registered voters (the previous three sampled all adults) and gauged attitudes across a host of additional demographic groups. The poll’s headline is that a large majority (59 percent) opposed the OBBB, and this finding was consistent across virtually every category of voters. Notable groups with majority opposition include:

Hispanics (58 percent)

Voters earning less than $50,000 a year (60 percent)

Non-college voters (59 percent)

Suburban voters (62 percent)

Rural voters (55 percent)

Independents (73 percent)

In fact, the bill found favor among just five demographic categories: Republicans, conservatives, “very conservative” voters, 2024 Trump voters, and white evangelicals—all groups that overwhelmingly approve of the president in virtually every respect.

The other key takeaway is that nearly half (49 percent) of respondents said they believe the law will hurt their family, while less than one-quarter (23 percent) said they thought it would help.

Quinnipiac

The Quinnipiac poll, the last one conducted before the bill’s passage, similarly asked only three relevant questions: the extent to which respondents had heard about it, whether they supported it on the whole, and whether they supported one specific provision. They, too, limited their sample to registered voters.

Overall, about 70 percent of voters had heard or read at least “some” about the bill. Interestingly, the group that had paid the most attention was Democrats (42 percent had heard “a lot”), and they had overwhelmingly negative views about it: a mere one percent supported its passage compared to 87 percent who opposed it. For their part, fewer Republicans (31 percent) had heard a lot about the bill, and though a large majority supported it (67 percent), sizable shares either opposed it (17 percent) or had no opinion (16 percent). But the group driving the bill’s negatives was independents. Fully two-thirds (65 percent) opposed it while just 20 percent supported it.

The poll also gauged voters’ attitudes on the Medicaid work requirements. The public was evenly split, with 47 percent supporting against 46 percent opposing. However, the split was not neatly along partisan lines. Twelve percent of Republicans opposed this change while 17 percent of Democrats supported it. Among independents, the provision was underwater by 10 points, 43 to 53.

These five polls paint a pretty clear picture: though Americans are open to some of OBBB’s individual components, they oppose many of them and fear that overall it won’t help people like them. There’s no doubt that Democrats, especially those running in competitive races, will seek to capitalize on these early dour sentiments toward the new law heading into next year’s midterms. Whether Trump and his Republican allies can convince the American people otherwise remains to be seen.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!s1fW!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25a3ca3b-21fb-47b0-865d-d495194a71a1_1024x683.jpeg",N,,2025-07-08 13:32:05.439236

More than 100 are dead and dozens more remain missing after flash floods in the parched area known as Texas Hill Country swept away entire holiday camps and homes on Friday night – in what appears to have been another unremarkable storm that stalled before dumping huge quantities of rain over a short period of time, a phenomenon that has becoming increasingly common as the planet warms.

It remains unclear why the early warning system failed to result in the timely evacuation of Camp Mystic, where 700 girls were camped on a known flood plain on the Guadalupe River, but there is mounting concern that the chaos and cuts instigated by Trump and his billionaire donor Elon Musk at the National Weather Service (NWS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) may have contributed to the death toll.

“This is the exact kind of storm that meteorologists, climate scientists, emergency management experts have been talking about and warning about for decades at this point, and there’s absolutely no reason that this won’t happen in other parts of the country. This is what happens when you let climate change run unabated and break apart the emergency management system – without investing in that system at the local and state level,” said Samantha Montano, professor of emergency management at Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

“It takes a lot of money, expertise and time to eliminate risk and make sure that agencies are prepared to respond when a flood situation like in Texas happens. And if you eliminate those preparedness efforts, if you fire the people who do that work, then the response will not be effective.”

Fema was created in 1979 by Jimmy Carter – precisely because states were struggling to cope with major disasters – and works closely with state and local government agencies to provide resources, coordination, technical expertise, leadership and communication with the public when they cannot cope alone.

Upon returning to the White House, Trump immediately began threatening to disband Fema, belittling the agency amid its ongoing efforts to help communities devastated by the Los Angeles wildfires and Hurricane Helene, the category 4 storm that left at least 230 people dead in southern Appalachia.

The threats were followed by a pledge to dismantle Fema at the end of the 2025 hurricane season, without offering any clear plan about what would come next. The cuts are part of the administration’s unsubstantiated claims that the states and private enterprises are capable and best positioned to provide most federal services including weather forecasting, scientific research and emergency management.

Reports suggest that more than a third of Fema’s permanent full-time workforce has been fired or accepted buyouts, including some of its most experienced and knowledgeable leaders who coordinate disaster responses – which can involve multiple federal agencies for months or years.

Emergency management and the weather service work hand in hand. At the NWS, more than 600 people have already been laid off or taken early retirement, leading to offices across storm and flood-prone areas of the US to be short of meteorologists and round-the-clock staffing cover. The agency has also had to scale back routine weather monitoring.

Two senior meteorologists at the San Antonio NWS office, which is responsible for forecasting in the Hill Country region, were among the casualties of Musk’s buyouts and layoffs. This included the warning coordination meteorologist, who is usually responsible for liaising with local emergency managers to help translate NWS forecasts into likely impacts that inform local actions such as warnings and evacuation orders.

But Trump said it was unlikely the staff cuts to the NWS will be reversed, even in the wake of the Texas floods. “I would think not,” the president said on Sunday about a possible reversal. “This was a thing that happened in seconds. Nobody expected it. Nobody saw it. Very talented people are there, they didn’t see it.”

Accuweather, the popular commercial weather forecasting services, relies on the NWS for much of its foundational meteorological data and forecasts. Fema often steps in to cover emergency accommodation and reconstruction costs for Americans without adequate insurance and/or the means to rebuild.

Reports suggest NWS weather balloons, which assess storm risk by measuring wind speed, humidity, temperature and other conditions that satellites may not detect, have been canceled in recent weeks from Nebraska to Florida due to staff shortages. At the busiest time for storm predictions, deadly heatwaves and wildfires, weather service staffing is down by more than 10% and, for the first time in almost half a century, some forecasting offices no longer have 24/7 cover.

In May, the NWS office in eastern Kentucky scrambled to cover the overnight forecast as severe storms moved through the region, triggering multiple tornadoes that eventually killed 28 people.

Despite such threats, the Republican budget bill signed by Trump last week cuts $150m in funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) to help improve future weather forecasts and also shrinks the amount of money to the National Science Foundation, the premier federal agency supporting basic science and engineering research, by 56% next year.

The 2026 budget makes significant cuts to Noaa including terminating the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which in essence could be the end of the efforts to improve warnings for events like the Texas floods, warned Alan Gerard, former head of the Warning Research and Development Division of the Noaa National Severe Storms Laboratory, speaking on DemocracyNow! on Monday.

NSF funded research has played a pivotal role in developing early warning systems for all sorts of hazards, but more work is urgently needed to improve local accuracy and community acceptability amid the growing threats due to global heating. There is no other funding source capable of filling this gap.

“The Hill Country is a desert area with big rivers which have had historic major floods and that are prone to flash flooding – but like most of rural America do not have gauge systems. Without gauges, the warnings don’t come early enough, and with flash floods every 15 minutes can save lives. This is something we can do better,” said Ryan Thigpen, a flood scientist trying to improve early warning systems in Appalachia .

Texas senator Ted Cruz has called for “a better system of warnings to get kids out of harm’s way” in the wake of the disaster, even though he inserted language into the “big beautiful” bill to slash Noaa’s weather forecasting upgrades. Local officials, too, have sought to distract attention away from Trump’s cuts – and their support for his plans – but the lack of leadership at Fema is impossible to ignore especially as Trump plans to visit the area with the secretary of homeland security, Kristi Noem, on Friday.

David Richardson, the acting administrator of Fema, has not traveled to Texas. Richardson, a former US marine with no emergency management experience prior to his appointment in May, is most notable for his warning to agency staff to not oppose Trump’s plan for Fema or “I will run right over you.”

“A lot of key people at Fema who worked there for years, decades in many cases, and hold the expertise that is needed to be able to actually move the resources of the agency, are gone. Fema is so depleted, it’s unclear if they are even capable of launching a huge response right now,” said Montano, author of Disasterology: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the Climate Crisis.

“It’s not the same level as during [hurricane] Helene but there’s already a lot of inaccurate information out there, and Fema is no longer a trusted voice – we haven’t heard from the administrator, only secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, which is very unusual. We’re almost at the point where we can say no one’s home at Fema… there is no trusted voice,” Montano added.

The turmoil at the federal agencies tasked with predicting and responding to disaster comes as the threat from extreme weather grows due to the human-caused climate crisis. The Texas floods occurred in a warmer, more moisture-laden atmosphere than in the past, with one analysis finding that climate change has made conditions 7% wetter and 1.5C hotter than they would’ve been otherwise.

“We have added a lot of carbon to the atmosphere, and that extra carbon traps energy in the climate system,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University. “Because of this extra energy, every weather event we see now carries some influence from climate change. The only question is how big that influence is.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c394864177724629dc63439b9abf9747eaff30/457_0_4562_3650/master/4562.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f97b44d9f3c9efeb8cb3cfb9e14d8d34,N,,2025-07-08 13:38:26.327984

Investor and Investment Media inquiries: 949-273-4990 ir@cetyinc.com Source: Clean Energy Technologies, Inc.","IRVINE, CA., July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clean Energy Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: CETY) (the “Company” or “CETY”), a clean energy technology company offering power generation, waste to energy, battery storage, and heat to power solutions to deliver affordable, scalable, and eco-friendly energy, clean fuels, and alternative electricity for a sustainable future, is pleased to announce that its technologies should remain fully eligible for federal clean energy tax incentives following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025.

Under the new legislation, projects utilizing CETY’s waste heat-to-power, biomass combined heat and power (CHP), and battery storage technologies should continue to qualify for the most Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and Production Tax Credits (PTC) established by the Inflation Reduction Act—up to 30% ITC or 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour PTC—provided they meet updated requirements for zero greenhouse gas emissions, prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards.

“This legislation reinforces our competitive edge, said Kam Mahdi, CEO of CETY. “Unlike solar, wind, EV, or hydrogen projects, many of which face new limitations, our technologies remain fully supported. This positions CETY as a premier opportunity for shareholders seeking exposure to resilient, profitable clean energy solutions.”

The OBBBA retains incentives for technologies like CETY’s when:

Projects began construction by December 31, 2024, qualifying them under existing IRA-era credits.

New projects meet stricter requirements under Section 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Credit) and Section 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Credit), including:

Demonstrated zero or net-negative lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions

Compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship guidelines

Use of U.S.-sourced components to satisfy domestic content rules

No participation by prohibited foreign entities of concern

The updated tax credits will gradually phase down starting in 2033 and sunset by the end of 2035, creating a limited window for investors and developers to capitalize on these incentives.

“As the energy landscape shifts, our waste heat recovery, biomass CHP, power generation, and battery storage solutions are essential for industrial and commercial facilities aiming to cut emissions and operating costs,” Kam Mahdi added. “Whether it’s converting agricultural or forestry waste into clean energy through biomass systems, capturing waste heat from industrial processes to generate power, tapping geothermal resources for sustainable electricity, or providing reliable power and storage for high-demand applications like data centers and crypto mining operations, CETY stands ready to deliver cutting-edge technologies that meet—and exceed—the federal government’s latest standards. CETY also anticipates curing Nasadq price deficiency by Novenmber 3rd , 2025.”

Late last month, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the agency’s intent to update the 2024 Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELGs) for Steam Electric Power Generating Units.

On March 12, Administrator Lee Zeldin announced EPA would reconsider 2024 pollution limits for coal power plants. This summer, EPA intends to take the next step to advance this action by proposing to extend compliance deadlines for many of the zero-discharge requirements in the 2024 Rule and the deadline for facilities to decide whether to submit a Notice of Planned Participation. EPA also intends to explore other flexibilities to promote reliable and affordable power generation.

This initial rulemaking will also seek additional information on zero-discharge technologies, including cost and performance data. This information will help EPA determine whether to move forward with a second rulemaking to address zero-discharge technologies and other flexibilities to ensure the U.S. electric utilities can better meet projected energy demand over the next decade. The scope of this second rulemaking could also address unmanaged combustion residual leachate, another type of wastewater.

Background:

EPA reviewed existing regulations and identified the 2024 Steam Electric ELG Rule as a potential burden on energy resources. The 2024 Rule imposes stringent requirements on certain wastewaters from facilities, requiring facilities not to discharge any pollutants from certain types of industrial wastewaters. These types of requirements are known as zero-discharge requirements.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELGs) are national industry-specific wastewater regulations based on the performance of demonstrated wastewater treatment technologies (often called “technology-based limits”). They are intended to represent the greatest pollutant reductions that are economically achievable for an entire industry and are incorporated into permits designed to be protective of human health and environmental quality.

Steam electric facilities use fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) or nuclear reactions to heat water in boilers, which generates steam. The steam is used to drive turbines connected to electric generators. These facilities may generate wastewater in the form of chemical pollutants and thermal pollution from their water treatment, power cycle, ash handling and air pollution control systems, and other sources.

Impact on Maryland:

While many of the coal-fired plants in Maryland have been retired, the state still has energy facilities that utilize natural gas and nuclear power. This action from the EPA would only weaken federal regulations; current state regulations are likely to remain intact. Increasingly, Maryland and other states have been filling in areas where the federal government has weakened environmental policy. Depending on how far the EPA cuts its current requirements, state officials may look to restore certain provisions at the state level.

Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.
The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs.
“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said.
The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states.","Not all farmers and ranchers will agree in a discussion about climate change, but it would be difficult to find a Midwest producer who did not value climate-related data addressing drought, precipitation, temperature and frost outlooks.

These are all pieces of data gathered and distributed by the Ames-based Midwest Climate Hub, which along with the other 10 regional climate hubs under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is slated to be cut from the federal agriculture budget.

The U.S. House appropriations bill that sets the 2026 fiscal year budgets for agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration and related agencies includes “no funds for climate hubs or climate corps.”

The summary of the bill, which closely follows budget requests from President Donald Trump, says it “safeguards American taxpayer dollars and preserves core functions” by eliminating funding for climate hubs, among other changes.

Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.

Lowering the information barrier

Laurie Nowatzke was formerly the associate director of the Midwest Climate Hub, before she was terminated in February and then brought back in March briefly before she took the second deferred resignation program offered to federal employees.

Nowatzke said part of her role at the hub was to “bridge” on-the-ground responses and needs of producers to USDA research, and vice versa.

Each climate hub is a little different, depending on the needs of their region, but Nowatzke said climate, in its most basic form relating to weather patterns, was a big focus for the Midwest.

“A huge focus of ours was taking that sort of experienced climate and weather conditions and how that applies or affects agriculture,” Nowatzke said.

This is most seen through the ag-focus climate outlooks the hub put out monthly, and weekly during crop season.

Nowatzke said as of the end of April when she left the office, staff were not allowed to update content on the website and have instead continued to send the outlooks via email to subscribers.

She said the climate outlooks were a “key product” the hub put out that producers and stakeholders said was especially helpful to contextualize the “vast array of climate and weather data” available from outlets like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Rod Pierce, a long-time corn and soybean farmer in central Iowa, said the outlooks help him with both long- and short-term planning in his operation. They help him answer questions such as when is the last frost so he can plant, is it going to be dry, and importantly, what conditions are other Midwestern states facing that he should take into account when marketing his commodities.

“Weather is so important in us making decisions, trying to look at the trend for the year…do I want to grow corn or beans…it just helps put some of that stuff in line,” Pierce said.

He said the hub reports give him a “big picture” of trends in the region, and he feels the information is trustworthy.

“We know the people that are doing it are not just blowing smoke,” Pierce said. “It’s good data, it’s researched data.”

Alli Wenman, the regional climate outreach project manager for the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s extension, said in interviews with extension office managers and educators throughout the Midwest, she learned access to training and applicable information were the top tools these professionals said they needed to discuss the impacts of climate change with producers in their regions.

“They need to know the climate science … but they also need to know the social science, like, how do I facilitate that conversation around climate,” Wenman said. “The hub has that information and has the capacity to build those tools, the capacity to build those trainings.”

Wenman spoke with these professionals as part of a project, funded by USDA, to forge connections between university extension programs and the climate hubs and work toward greater agricultural resilience in the face of climate change.

She said the partnership with the Midwest Climate Hub was “key” to cut through the “noise” at the research level and give producers the tools and data that matter most to their operations.

Wenman said the ag-focused climate outlooks have become a trustworthy source of information for a lot of producers.

“The information is out there, but it’s maybe not framed for ag,” Wenman said. “There’s too much information, so they help us sort through what information is relevant for ag and put it into ag terms.”

The reports pull information from nearly a dozen agencies and compile it into a four-page report full of climate, crop and soil moisture information and graphics.

A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, who served on the subcommittee that passed the bill, said the hubs are a “duplicative” program and the same research can be conducted through competitive agriculture research programs that are already funded by the federal government and supported by the House’s newest bill.

The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs.

“The bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food, drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities first,” the bill report reads.

Hinson, in a statement, said “farmers felt like they were screaming into a void” as the the Biden administration “focused on DEI and radical climate policies” while farmers’ “real needs were ignored.”

“This bill cuts wasteful spending – including for so-called “Climate Hubs” – and champions President Trump’s farmer-first agenda to strengthen longstanding research programs, support rural businesses and infrastructure, and safeguard our food supply,” Hinson said. “I will continue to support farmer-led conservation initiatives to ensure Iowa producers are empowered with conservation tools and have all the resources they need to feed and fuel the world.”

The House appropriations committee also tried to reject funding for the hubs in its FY25 budget bill, though the Senate’s version expanded funding for the program. Because Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills, the government has been operating on continuing spending resolutions based on the fiscal year 2024 budget.

The Senate passed the massive, budget reconciliation package, known as the “one big beautiful bill” Tuesday which sets mandatory spending over a 10-year span. The appropriations bills, like the House-proposed ag bill, are separate budgets that deal with discretionary spending in the agencies.

Reports form the Hub

While the climate outlook reports are what many Midwest producers might know the hub for, the regional hubs also produced reports on the impacts of climate change, and mitigation strategies, on agriculture, forestry, tribal lands, wetlands and other region-specific areas.

Nowatzke said funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration helped the hub to “really chip away” at climate mitigation concerns and greenhouse gas emissions.

“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said.

The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states. The reports calculated long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, growing season length and the impacts these have had, and are projected to have, on agriculture.

Nowatzke said these reports also employed feedback from on-the-ground folks at extension offices, crop physiologists and farmers to determine the strategies that would be helpful for a farm trying to deal with a changing climate.

The hub also explored, and produced reports on topics like: the relationship between climate change and specialty crops in the Midwest and a guide on managing the risks of field and equipment fires which are exacerbated by drought conditions.

The hub, in collaboration with on Midwestern Regional Climate Center, also reported and developed interactive tools for farmers on soil temperature and frost dates.

Nowatzke said while the Climate Hub sits on a congressional chopping block, and has already dealt with cuts to staff and programs, most of the hub’s collaborating agencies have also been hit by federal cuts.

She said without the hubs, this climate research at other agencies could persist, but she expects USDA would struggle in “delivering the science that they do, to the people that they’re developing the science for.”

“Researchers serve a really important role in developing that work and publishing it, but also we need professionals who are trained and capable and have capacity to actually disseminate that in ways that people can use it,” Nowatzke said.

Wenman said this is what she hears from other extension officers and producers who, while they might not use the term climate change, are seeking tools to help adapt to more extreme weather, drought patterns and other associated effects of a changing climate. Wenman said the hub information is “actionable” and the “stuff that really matters to people.”

“Extension is trying to prepare our staff to better help farmers deal with the effects of changing climate conditions,” Wenman said. “Losing the hub would seriously hinder our ability to continue to do our jobs well within that realm.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/usda-corn-drought-field-1536x864-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:34:02.597802

The cost of building new natural gas plants has already tripled since 2022, with orders for new gas turbines backlogged past 2029.","This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis.

Natural gas price spikes, grid transmission bottlenecks, and a data center construction boom are already straining America’s power grid. The Republican Party just passed a budget bill that might break it.

Donald Trump and the GOP’s irrational energy agenda deliberately sidelines wind and solar energy — the lowest cost, fastest-to-deploy sources of energy generation available — to prop up a dying fossil fuel industry that won’t be able to meet rising demand.

The consequences will be severe: hundreds of billions in clean energy investment will evaporate, hundreds of gigawatts of power won’t get built, and hundreds of millions of metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions will be produced. By 2035, according to Princeton’s ZERO Lab for energy research, the U.S. will have added 45% less clean electricity to the grid than it would have if Trump had not been reelected.

All of this comes as America’s electricity demand is accelerating for the first time in decades. A report last year from the Clean Grid Initiative projected up to a five-fold increase in demand on the grid. Meanwhile, the U.S. added 64 TWh of solar generation to the grid in 2024 — enough to meet fully half of the record-breaking growth in electricity demand last year, according to independent energy think tank Ember Energy.

The only way America can meet rising energy demand and keep costs down is by building more wind and solar. Clean energy means lower utility bills, more good jobs, and cleaner air.

The Republicans don’t care. It’s a tale as old as the party. The GOP campaigns on one thing — lowering the cost of energy for Americans — and does the opposite.

The GOP Plot to Raise Your Energy Bill

The final version of the GOP’s bill, which Trump signed into law on July 4, phases out clean energy tax credits by the end of 2027, a year earlier than the timeline in the original House version.

Rather than “unleash” American energy, the Republican Party just kneecapped it. The loss of renewable subsidies threatens to disrupt or cancel a combined capacity of 547 GW of wind and solar by 2027 or later, according to Cleanview’s tracker. That’s not “leveling the playing field” with the massively-subsidized fossil fuel industry — it’s rigging the game.

While the bill does give some juicy handouts to the fossil fuel industry, it’s hard to see who else benefits. U.S. automakers will definitively lose the global electric vehicle race. Big Tech will have to pay a premium to power their AI data centers. Advanced manufacturers now face insurmountable regulatory hurdles. An estimated 2.3 million jobs in clean energy and associated industries will vanish over the next 10 years. The nascent battery manufacturing boom is over. And American households will soon face steep price hikes on their utility bills, with double-digit increases in states like Arizona and North Carolina.

If that wasn’t bad enough, in June, Trump stated plainly what he had already put into practice: a total ban on wind energy. “We’re not going to let windmills get built because we’re not going to destroy our country any further than it’s already been destroyed.” Adding cheap, abundant energy to the grid that would lower costs for working Americans simply isn’t worth the eyesore to Trump. Instead, Americans will foot the bill for Trump’s aesthetic preferences.

While China added 329 GW of solar last year alone, the U.S. added about 50. Once the tax credits expire, we’ll add even less. As energy expert, Doug Lewin, puts it: this isn’t energy dominance, it’s “energy submission.”

No Other Way Out

The Trump administration champions fossil fuels as the energy solution for the modern world — but the industry can’t come close to replacing the renewable capacity that would be lost under the GOP’s rollback of clean energy incentives.

Demand may be high, but the natural gas industry can’t meet it. The cost of building new natural gas plants has already tripled since 2022, with orders for new gas turbines backlogged past 2029. And as Heatmap reports, manufacturers like GE Vernova have little incentive to ramp up production capacity and risk future profit margins due to overcapacity. By 2027, GE will be able to produce only 20 gigawatts’ worth of gas turbines per year — worldwide.

These supply constraints won’t be fixed anytime soon. CEO John Ketchum of NextEra Energy calculates that natural gas will only be able to make up 16% of the 460 GW of additional capacity needed by the U.S. by 2030. The energy consulting firm, The Brattle Group, found that the combined capacity of new natural gas plants and nuclear plant restarts will only supply about a third of projected peak demand growth by 2030.

And once gas plants are built, unlike wind or solar, their electricity prices are tied to a global market prone to volatility — as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine made painfully clear. On top of that, the Trump administration’s push to boost LNG exports will only intensify global demand for natural gas and raise prices at home.

The administration’s gung-ho nuclear stance also faces headwinds from its own self-defeating policies — like arbitrary staff cuts at the Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission — that make building nuclear power more difficult. Not to mention that tariffs on key components, like steel and aluminum, drive up already staggering construction costs — jeopardizing projects like the reopening of the Palisades Nuclear Plant.

The final bill extended the window to claim tax credits for clean, firm power sources like nuclear, hydro, and geothermal for a decade — but this will still be too little, too late to stabilize energy prices. Industry analysts say no new nuclear plant will come online before 2032, at the earliest. And even if it did, the enormous upfront capital costs mean that any cost savings from nuclear appear on the timescale of decades, not years. While states like New York have moved forward with plans for new nuclear in an effort to improve “reliability and affordability,” the experience of some nuclear customers has been the opposite. Integrating nuclear’s constant baseload power may bolster the grid’s long-term reliability — but it won’t provide any short-term rate relief.

Republicans can idolize fossil fuels all they want, but the industry lacks the physical capacity to expand fast enough to meet demand.

Republicans Are Lying to You

Trump calls windmills “costly and unsightly.” His Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, derides net-zero goals as “sinister.” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum warns that the U.S. has “tipped” too far towards renewables. In one of the administration’s first executive orders, Trump bizarrely claimed that clean energy “makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans.”

These lies are designed to obscure the reality: it’s fossil fuels, not renewable energy, inflating energy prices. Sensitive to global markets, the price of natural gas fluctuates wildly in response to supply shocks and geopolitical instability, as the Russia-Ukraine war made painfully clear in 2022. Coal is even worse. In places like West Virginia, Republican regulators have long forced ratepayers to subsidize uneconomic, aging coal plants despite cheaper alternatives. Now, Trump is mandating the rest of the country follow suit.

Republicans are forcing Americans to accept higher utility bills just to prop up a dying fossil fuel industry — one that has already saddled the public with trillions in climate damages while raking in historic profits.",https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222880692.jpg?w=804,N,,2025-07-08 13:40:19.019896

The setback for Nissan’s new EV is the latest in a series of hurdles that carmakers globally have faced since China announced export controls of rare earths in early April.

Suzuki Motor, another Japanese giant, has reportedly halted production of its flagship Swift subcompact because of supply chain shortages, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters last month.

At the beginning of April, China announced it would curb its exports of dysprosium, gadolinium, scandium, terbium, samarium, yttrium, and lutetium. These so-called “heavy” and “medium” rare earth elements are mostly used in automotive applications, including rotors and motors and transmission in electric vehicles and hybrids, as well as in the defense industry in parts of jets, missiles, and drones.

The Chinese export restrictions reverberated through global supply chains and were initially felt in the automotive industry, where major car manufacturing associations warned that production and assembly lines are being idled due to a bottleneck in magnet and rare earth supply.

Germany’s automotive industry group VDA joined other carmakers to sound the alarm that the curbs and controls on China’s exports of rare earth elements and magnets could disrupt and even idle manufacturing lines.

In May, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation – which represents GM, Toyota, Volkswagen, and other major car manufacturers – warned of production reductions and even shutdowns of assembly lines without access to magnets and to rare earths.

China has eased some of its restrictions on exports of rare earth elements by approving “a certain number” of export licenses. However, global supply chains continue to feel the shortage of magnets and other rare earth-derived parts.

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026.

Ford's factory would manufacture battery cells utilizing technology from Chinese battery giant CATL.

Anyways, today in the Planet Money newsletter: five recent papers that we found interesting and worth sharing.

A long economic history of firewood in America

Why we liked this paper: a deep, historical dive into something we rarely think about — firewood.

Believe it or not, this one is buzzy and making the rounds. A recent working paper, ""Firewood in the American Economy: 1700 to 2010,"" really got our curiosity burning. We just wanted to huddle around it and bask in its insights.

Carnegie Mellon University economist Nicholas Muller explains how central firewood used to be in the American economy. Firewood was humanity's main energy source for centuries.

Yet, despite that, scholars have long lacked solid statistics about firewood prices over the long sweep of history. Muller explains that one big reason for this is that many Americans chopped down wood themselves. They often didn't buy it in the market, so historical prices have been hard to come by.

But as cities grew, many Americans could no longer chop down wood themselves. And so market transactions for firewood began to take place. Newspapers began publishing firewood prices in their classified sections. In this study, Muller finds more than 6,000 price quotes from historical sources and constructs a price index for firewood going all the way back to 1700.

This paper offers a bundle — ahem — of interesting facts, including:

+ Around 1860, firewood accounted for around 85% of energy consumption in the United States.

+ In the 1830s, the U.S. started to see large-scale coal production. However, coal remained relatively expensive compared with firewood, so it took a while for coal to dominate the U.S. energy market.

+ During the early- to mid-19th century, the price of firewood outpaced overall inflation. Firewood kept getting more and more expensive. Meanwhile, coal got cheaper and cheaper. ""The change in relative prices of these fuels appears to have played a fundamental role in the transition from wood to coal,"" Muller writes.

+ After 1870, demand for firewood began declining, and coal became the hottest energy source in the nation. By 1900, coal accounted for 71% of energy use in the United States. After World War I, Muller writes, coal's dominance began being eroded away by oil and natural gas.

This firewood paper reminded us of a classic paper from Yale University economist William Nordhaus, who calculated how the cost of lighting changed over a thousand years. Check out this Planet Money episode about it.

Political spending in the wake of school shootings

Why we liked this paper: a sobering look at interest group political spending in the wake of tragedies.

Another new study is … darker. It's titled ""Financial Firepower: School Shootings and the Strategic Contributions of Pro-Gun PACs."" The economists Eric Baldwin, Takuma Iwasaki and John Donohue look at what happens to political spending in the wake of school shootings.

Between 2000 and 2024, the economists write, there were more than 500 school shootings in the U.S. that resulted in at least one fatality. ""Yet rather than leading to significant policy change, these tragedies rarely result in more than empty promises,"" the economists write. They point to one significant reason for this.

The economists find that pro-gun political action committees ""increase contributions by 30.2% to [congressional] candidates in districts with fatal school shootings.""

This spending appears to be strategic. The economists find that pro-gun PACs increase spending only really in congressional districts that see fatal school shootings, not nonfatal school shootings or other mass shootings. The PACs' spending ramps up as elections approach and is mostly concentrated in congressional districts where elections are competitive.

NIMBYism spreads to the Sunbelt?

Why we liked this paper: It makes America's worsening housing affordability crisis make more sense.

The research of economists Ed Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko has long shined a spotlight on the problem of housing supply in the United States. We're not building enough housing, and it has been causing a housing affordability crisis.

For a long time, this lack of new housing seemed to be mainly a problem in coastal cities. In 2005, Glaeser and Gyourko published a study that divided America's housing market into three big regions: high-cost, high-demand coastal markets that did not build a lot of new housing and saw explosive growth in housing costs (like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston); low-demand, declining industrial cities (like Detroit and Cleveland); and roaring Sunbelt markets that built a lot of new housing (like Miami, Atlanta, Dallas and Phoenix). The building of new housing in these Sunbelt areas helped moderate price hikes even as demand grew.

In this new study, Glaeser and Gyourko find that something big has changed in the Sunbelt over the last couple of decades: They've begun to look a lot more like coastal areas in their lack of construction of new housing. The result: an explosion of home prices.

""From 2000-2024, Miami, Tampa and Phoenix ranked 1st, 5th, and 9th, in price growth across the twenty areas that make up the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20 City Composite Home Price NSA Index,"" the economists write. ""Each of these areas experienced more price growth than the New York City area, whose prices still increased by a healthy 70 percent. Between 1975 and 1999, no sunbelt city (outside of California) was among the top twelve of the same 20 markets.""

Why have Sunbelt regions begun to look more like coastal regions in recent years, with a lower rate of new housing construction and an explosion of home prices? The economists hypothesize that, basically, NIMBYism has spread there. They suggest that ""wealthier or better educated residents"" have moved in and altered the regulatory environment, making it harder to build housing.

The economists find that, if the rate of new housing construction between 2000 and 2020 looked like it did between 1980 and 2000, ""America would have 15 million more housing units.""

""The key driver appears to be that the intensity of housing production has dropped substantially over time, especially in many expanding sunbelt markets that were once housing production superstars,"" the economists write. ""More generally, there is a marked convergence in the pace of housing unit production across markets throughout the country: Miami has become far more like Los Angeles.""

Interestingly, coastal regions have begun to reckon with the regulatory barriers to building new housing. Last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom took actions to roll back environmental regulations that have held back development in California.

The economic effects of Native American casinos

Why we liked this paper: It provides an interesting perspective on Native American casinos.

Native American communities have long struggled economically. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, tribal leaders began to embrace an industry to help lift them up: casinos.

A new working paper from economists Randall Akee, Maggie R. Jones and Emilia Simeonova categorizes tribal gaming as a kind of ""place-based policy,"" a program aimed at economically developing an impoverished community as opposed to directly helping individuals.

On that front, tribal gaming seems to have been remarkably successful. It's now an industry that rakes in more than $40 billion a year. And the economists find that it is a real engine of opportunities for Native Americans. They find ""significantly higher employment of American Indians in the Accommodations, Food Services, Arts and Entertainment Industries compared with non-casino reservation ZIP codes in the same state. Further, we find an increase in wages for AIAN workers in these same industries, suggesting both an expansion of employment and better compensation in this sector for American Indians."" Casinos also bring in money that tribes use in various ways to help their communities, including cash transfers to tribe members, infrastructure, education and business investment.

Longer kindergarten school days boost mothers' work hours

Why we liked this paper: It provides more evidence on a way to close the gender pay gap.

Over the last decade, there has been a lot of economic research suggesting that the gender pay gap between women and men is driven by the fact that women, on average, continue to bear most of the burden of family caregiving. Claudia Goldin, who won the 2023 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, has done a lot of important research in this area. And one of her policy proposals to close the gender pay gap is pretty simple: extend school hours. That, she hypothesizes, will free up more time for women to pursue their careers and earn money.

A new study by economists Chloe Gibbs, Jocelyn S. Wikle and Riley Wilson offers more evidence supporting this idea. The working paper is titled ""A Matter of Time? Measuring Effects of Public Schooling Expansions on Families.""

The economists look at the effects of a remarkable change in early childhood education: the dramatic expansion of kindergarten from half day to full day over the last few decades. Since 1992, the share of American kindergartners in full-day schooling has almost doubled, from 43% to 83%.

The economists do a bunch of impressive statistical work to look at the casual effect of this change on family work hours. Interestingly, they find that this change hardly affected fathers, on average. They find that men with kids in half-day kindergarten ""actually spend more time at work than fathers of full-day kindergarten students.""

However, the economists found a big change for mothers: ""Our findings suggest that expansions in full-day kindergarten can explain approximately 2 percentage points, or 24 percent, of the 8.5 percentage-point increase in employment among mothers of 5- and 6-year-olds between 1992 and 2022.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1505x847+0+144/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F1e%2F7d5f8692466ea6f266f6f373fba4%2Fgettyimages-2168815200.png,N,,2025-07-08 13:35:26.549285

The Type 2 connector, sometimes referred to as Mennekes for the German company that designed it, is the standard AC charging plug in Europe, and is used in many other countries outside of North America.

Designed to be used by EVSE contractors and installers, the single-phase BZ820-EV can detect 28 different wiring fault conditions, as well as checking and indicating the voltage supply level as high or low.

The BZ820-EV connects directly to an EV charging point using a Type 2 connector, and a 4-position switch allows several vehicle states to be simulated. LEDs on the integrated Type 2 plug show the status of the control signal and indicate whether the voltage supply is present, and whether L, N and PE are correctly wired in a 3-wire cable.

The Governor has also made available $4 million to advance technologies that overcome data collection, transmission and operational challenges faced by utilities to manage electric vehicle (EV) charging. Together, these solutions will help to enhance grid flexibility, shift charging to accommodate energy demand, and lower charging costs for consumers.

“New York is leading the way in building a smarter, more sustainable energy future,” Governor Hochul said. “By investing in innovative technologies that support EV charging and integration with the grid, we are strengthening our clean energy infrastructure to meet the demands of tomorrow. We are also improving grid resiliency while making it easier and more affordable for New Yorkers to drive electric.”

The $3 million has been awarded to three projects through the Vehicle Grid Integration Program, administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), which provides funding for projects that are scalable and advance electric vehicle charging infrastructure through product development, technology demonstrations, or new business models. Technologies include bi-directional charging, energy storage, on-site energy generation, and EV managed charging.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “Investing in vehicle to grid integration is a game changer for utilities and consumers when it comes to balancing demand on the electric grid and these awarded companies have put forward innovative solutions to improve the way we achieve that balance. Advancing technologies that can shift when electric vehicle charging happens will open the door for future cost reductions, more renewable energy resources like wind and solar, increased grid flexibility and fewer infrastructure upgrades.”

The awarded projects include:

Charging Platform Lamppost Conduit Interconnection: Voltpost was awarded $775,000 to develop lamppost EV charging in the New York City area, Capital Region, and Hudson Valley focusing on UL certification, retrofits, and plans to deploy at least ten additional Level 2 charging stations in New York State.

Demonstrating Statewide Implementations of Flexible Interconnections for Fleets: The Mobility House was awarded $867,000 to show how utility distribution capacity can be maximized with flexible interconnections to support electric school bus charging at a depot in Staten Island and a second location yet to be determined in New York State to pilot a method for fast charger deployment that decouples charger construction from electric grid development timelines.

Distribution-Optimized EV Managed Charging to Enhance Grid Flexibility: Weave Grid, Inc. was awarded nearly $1 million to control when EV managed charging will occur in the Orange and Rockland Utilities service area by using software and topology data to coordinate schedules and balance the energy load.

Managed EV Funding

Also announced today is $4 million in new funding for a competitive solicitation offered through NYSERDA’s Electric Vehicle Managed Charging program. Proposals are sought from researchers, developers and consultants, who individually or as a team, will develop or demonstrate technologies that can solve the data collection, data transmission and operational challenges faced by utilities when integrating electric vehicles, regardless of supplier, with the electric grid. Proposals must include behind-the-meter EV integrated solutions including the transfer of bi-directional data and utility control over charging, or both to study how these solutions can alleviate demand on the electric grid.

The focus of this solicitation was identified by NYSERDA working with Avangrid, parent company of Rochester Gas & Electric (RG&E) and New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), to provide data that will help inform future utility rate and program planning for EV managed charging.

Proposals are due on September 16, 2025, by 3:00 p.m. ET. For more information on this funding opportunity please visit NYSERDA’s website.

For more than fifty years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. Today’s announcement builds on the success of NYSERDA’s Grid Modernization program, which since 2016 has awarded approximately $65 million to over 110 grid technology companies and research organizations for projects that improve low-cost high-accuracy grid sensors, modeling and simulation tools, and advanced engineering solutions. New York State’s investments in research, development, and commercialization support innovators accelerating the clean energy transition. NYSERDA’s Innovation and Research program is deploying approximately $1.2 billion over 15 years as direct research investments and commercialization support. To date, more than $800 million in investments have supported more than 700 companies and made nearly 300 products commercially available to individuals, businesses, and utilities.

In addition, New York State is investing nearly $3 billion in electrifying its transportation sector and rapidly advancing measures that all new passenger cars and trucks sold, are zero emissions, along with all school buses being zero emissions the same year. There are a range of initiatives to grow access to EVs and improve clean transit for all New Yorkers including the Drive Clean Rebate, EV Make Ready, EVolve NY, the New York Truck Voucher Incentive Program (NYTVIP), the New York School Bus Incentive Program, and the Direct Current Fast Charger Program.

“We are working quickly to dig into the numbers to unpack how DOE reached its conclusions,” Marquis said.","Dive Brief:

Blackouts could increase by 100 times in 2030, relative to today’s averages, if the United States continues to shutter power plants and fails to add additional firm capacity amid rising demand, the U.S. Department of Energy said in a Monday report.

The report includes a uniform methodology to identify regions at risk of power outages and guide federal reliability “interventions,” DOE said. The report was required by President Donald Trump’s April executive order which directed the agency to respond to an “energy emergency” he declared in January.

But clean energy advocates say the report appears to exaggerate the risks, and undercount the contributions of wind, solar and battery storage resources. “If the analysis is overly pessimistic about advanced energy technologies and the future of the grid, consumers will end up paying too much for resources we no longer need,” Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United, said in an email.

Dive Insight:

DOE’s report assumes 104 GW of plant retirements by 2030, alongside the addition of 210 GW of new generation — but only 22 GW of the additions will be “firm, reliable, dispatchable generation.”

“Modeling shows annual outage hours could increase from single digits today to more than 800 hours per year. Such a surge would leave millions of households and businesses vulnerable,” the report said. “We must renew a focus on firm generation and continue to reverse radical green ideology in order to address this risk.”

Average Loss of Load Hours could jump from 8.1 annually to 817.7 under some scenarios, the report said. It estimated an additional 100 GW of new peak capacity is needed by 2030 — of which, 50 GW is attributable to data centers.

“Data centers can be built in 18 months, but it takes more than three times as long to add new generation required to service those data centers,” DOE said in a fact sheet accompanying the report.

Even assuming no retirements, DOE said its model found outage risks in several regions rise more than 30-fold, “proving the queue alone cannot close the dependable-capacity deficit.”

“This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

America’s Power, which represents the coal sector, praised the report.

The analysis “is further proof that the premature retirement of coal plants is putting the reliability of the U.S. electricity grid at risk,” America’s Power President and CEO Michelle Bloodworth said in a statement. “Baseload power sources like coal are being replaced by less reliable sources like wind and solar. These renewables are not capable of meeting the constant 24/7 electricity demands required for AI, data centers, and other advanced technologies.”

The report includes a methodology that DOE says it will use to identify which generation resources within a region are critical to system reliability. The methodology uses hourly datasets for load, generation and interregional transfer capabilities for the 23 U.S. electric subregions.

DOE said it developed its outage risk estimates by running simulations using 12 different years of historical weather, with every hour based on actual data for wind, solar, load and thermal availability.

Clean energy advocates say they have doubts about the agency’s methodology.

DOE’s study “appears to exaggerate the risk of blackouts and undervalue the contributions of entire resource classes, like wind, solar, and battery storage,” AEU’s Marquis said.

“We are working quickly to dig into the numbers to unpack how DOE reached its conclusions,” Marquis said. “But it’s troubling that the report was not subject to public input and scrutiny, especially since the Executive Order that mandated it calls for it to be used to identify power plants that should be retained for reliability.”

The methodology “is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country’s energy future depends upon decades-old coal- and gas-plants, rather than clean renewables,” Sierra Club Senior Attorney Greg Wannier said in an email.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states “are already well equipped to meet any projected resource needs through the existing regulatory process, which ensures that electricity demand is reliably met at the least public cost,” Wannier said. “Any effort by DOE to override this process to forcibly keep coal plants online past their planned retirements would be an extraordinary and unlawful overreach of its regulatory authority.”

In May, DOE issued an emergency order under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, directing Consumers Energy to delay, by about three months, shutting down a 1,560-MW, coal-fired power plant in Michigan. Earthjustice and other groups have asked the agency for rehearing, and said they may go to the courts to challenge the order.

“Determining the reserve margin and ‘critical’ resources are complex decisions with severe health and economic consequences that Congress rightly entrusted FERC to oversee using a robust public adjudication process,” said Christine Powell, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice’s clean energy program. DOE’s methodology “attempts to usurp that process, and would impose billions of dollars and harmful pollutants on consumers without any corresponding benefits for anyone except for the coal industry.”

DOE’s analysis “doesn’t support President Trump’s strategy of using emergency declarations to stop power plants from carrying through with their plans to retire,” said Jennifer Danis, federal energy policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity.

“The Trump administration’s own study has found that no present emergency exists in the two regions where it already issued 202(c) orders,” Danis said. “Reforms may be needed to ensure better planning for future resource adequacy to power AI, but they should focus on improving existing markets and planning standards, as well as speeding up new resource interconnection, rather than forcing customers to pay to keep old, inefficient plants online.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xSueupLO-uOCKTyUOyiol-Rl2k7Up54i5rN3ImsQiZY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ibGFja291dC1zbWFsbC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-07-08 13:33:23.184940

Setting conditions on the deal would help prevent NRG from exerting market power, Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent market monitor, said in a filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Even with the increased capacity, NRG and LS Power contend that NRG would be unable to exert market power, according to their June 12 application at FERC.
Also, under PJM’s market conditions, capacity prices are likely to continue being “very high,” the market monitor said.
“The market conditions and structural market power increase the potential impact of market power on customers under the current market structure,” it said.","The PJM Interconnection’s market monitor on Monday urged federal regulators to set conditions on a pending $12 billion deal between NRG Energy and LS Power citing concern over potential market abuses.

Under the planned transaction, NRG would buy from LS Power 18 natural gas-fired power plants, totaling about 13 GW across nine states, some of which fall in PJM’s territory. NRG would also acquire CPower, a commercial and industrial virtual power plant platform that has about 6 GW of capacity and operates in all deregulated markets in the U.S., according to a news release announcing the deal.

Setting conditions on the deal would help prevent NRG from exerting market power, Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent market monitor, said in a filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The companies expect to close the deal early next year, subject to FERC and other approvals.

Without the conditions, Monitoring Analytics said it would oppose the transaction because it would increase NRG’s ability to affect electricity and capacity prices.

Under the pending deal, NRG’s capacity in PJM would jump from about 2.1 GW to 9.5 GW. The transaction would also add to NRG’s emergency and pre-emergency demand response capability. Even with the increased capacity, NRG and LS Power contend that NRG would be unable to exert market power, according to their June 12 application at FERC.

However, the transaction would increase NRG’s market power in some parts of PJM, according to Monitoring Analytics.

Also, under PJM’s market conditions, capacity prices are likely to continue being “very high,” the market monitor said.

“The market conditions and structural market power increase the potential impact of market power on customers under the current market structure,” it said.

The market monitor said it is concerned that NRG would be able to affect capacity prices using its increased ownership in emergency and pre-emergency demand resources, partly because those resources lack market power mitigation rules.

The demand response resources don’t have to bid into the capacity market, which would allow NRG to withhold them from the market to drive up capacity prices to the benefit of its power plants, according to the market monitor. Also, the resources don’t face bidding price caps, which allows for economic withholding, Monitoring Analytics said.

The lack of market mitigation rules for demand response resources is especially significant because they were included in PJM’s reserve margin for the first time ever in the 2025/2026 delivery year, the market monitor said.

The market monitor recommended that FERC impose “unique obligations” on NRG by requiring the company to offer its emergency and pre-emergency demand resources in the capacity markets.

Also, NRG should be barred from removing generating resources from the PJM market to serve behind-the-meter colocated load until FERC’s policy on colocation is clearly set and explicitly permitted by commission policy, the market monitor said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/vS3lpRxxYrc3eJ8ZesMJg4ICC_DxYstg5ZJ_9wghHFI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9OUkdfSm9saWV0X1Bvd2VyX1N0YXRpb24uanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-08 13:33:26.103769

6’s new Section 35.004(c-1) of the Texas Utilities Code (ensuring that large load customers contribute to utilities’ transmission-access cost recovery).","Key Provisions

S.B. 6 amends multiple sections of the Texas Utilities Code and introduces new provisions designed to ensure that large load customers fairly contribute to system costs and can be reliably managed during grid emergencies.

Planning and Interconnection Standards for Large Loads

The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) must adopt rules governing the interconnection of “large load customers.” Large load customers are defined as customers requesting interconnection exceeding 75 megawatts at a single site (unless the PUC lowers the threshold). [New Sections 37.0561(a) and 37.0561(c) of the Texas Utilities Code]. The rules established by the PUC must: 1) support business development while minimizing stranded infrastructure investment and maintaining system reliability [Id. at subsection (b)]; 2) require large load customers to disclose to the utility[1] concurrent interconnection requests elsewhere in Texas that could result in a material change in or withdrawal of the interconnection request [Id. at subsection (d)]; 3) require large load customers to disclose to the interconnecting utility information about the customer’s “on-site backup generating facilities,” which is defined as generation that cannot be exported to ERCOT and can serve, in the aggregate, at least 50% of on-site demand [Id. at subsection (e)]; and 4) allow ERCOT to direct large load customers to either deploy the customer’s on-site backup generation facilities or curtail load in an energy emergency. [Id.].

2. Study Fees and Financial Commitment Requirements

Under S.B. 6, the PUC must set a flat screening study fee of at least $100,000 owed to the interconnecting utility. Large load customers requesting additional capacity after the screening study must pay an additional fee. Unused fees can be credited towards satisfying financial obligations for procurement or interconnection agreements at the same geographic site. [Id. at subsection (f)].

The PUC must also require large load customers to demonstrate site control for the proposed load location [Id. at subsection (g)] and create uniform financial commitment requirements for transmission infrastructure development necessary to serve large load customers. [Id. at subsection (h)]. Acceptable proof of financial commitment includes: 1) refundable security provided on a dollar per megawatt basis as set by the PUC [Id. at subsections (h)(1) and (i)]; 2) construction contributions; 3) security under an agreement requiring a large load customer to pay for significant equipment and services before signing an electronic delivery service agreement; or 4) other forms of financial commitment acceptable by the PUC. [Id. at subsections (h)(2)–(4)].

3. Oversight of Net Metering Arrangements with Co-Located Generation

When a large load customer proposes to net meter with an existing generation resource, the generation owner must provide advance notice to ERCOT. [New Section 39.169(a) of the Texas Utilities Code]. ERCOT must complete a reliability impact study within 120 days and submit its findings to the PUC, which has 60 days to approve, deny, or condition the arrangement. [Id. at subsection (d)]. Conditions must require a generation resource that produces dispatchable power to make available to ERCOT in the event of an emergency at least the same amount of power the generator was providing prior to the net metering arrangement. [Id.] PUC conditions may also include load reduction, dispatchable generation obligations, or assurance that system users are held harmless for stranded or underutilized asset costs. [Id. at subsections (d)(1)–(3)]. If the PUC does not act on the reliability impact study, the arrangement is approved by default. [Id. at subsection (e)]. Any non-time-limited conditions must be reviewed at least every 5 years. [Id. at subsection (f)].

4. Demand Management and Reliability Services

Under S.B. 6, ERCOT must create a large load demand management service for customers with demand of at least 75 megawatts. [New Section 39.170(b) of the Texas Utilities Code]. The protocol includes: establishing when the service may be used; requiring at least a 24-hour notice and curtailment during the entirety of an energy emergency; and prohibiting participation by customers already curtailing in response to electricity prices or participating in other reliability or ancillary services. [Id. at subsection (b)(1)-(3)]. Also, with certain exceptions, the PUC must require ERCOT to ensure that the utilities have protocols and equipment necessary to curtail the load of new large “transmission-voltage” customers, before the customer is interconnected. [Id. at subsection (a)].

5. Limited Electricity Generation by Water Utilities

S.B. 6 adds a new section to the Texas Water Code, allowing water supply and sewer service companies to generate electricity for internal operations, including water pumping and treatment. [New Section 67.0115(a) of the Texas Water Code]. In counties with fewer than 350,000 people, water and sewer service companies may sell excess power into the ERCOT market if the power is primarily used for water or sewer operations [Id. at subsection (b)(1)] and the company registers as a power generation company under Texas Utilities Code § 39.351 (establishing a registration requirement for power generation companies). [Id. at subsection (b)(2)]. Revenue from these sales must be used solely for production costs (including administrative, employees, equipment, fuel, and maintenance costs) or statutory purposes as enumerated in Texas Water Code § 67.002 (listing water supply, sewer service, flood control, and drainage systems as the statutory purposes). [Id. at subsection (c)].

6. Review of Transmission Cost Allocation Methodologies

S.B. 6 mandates the PUC to review the current four coincident peak methodology used to allocate wholesale transmission costs under Texas Utilities Code § 35.004(d) (providing a transmission-cost formula based on the postage stamp pricing method). The PUC must evaluate whether: 1) the four coincident peak methodology ensures that all loads appropriately contribute to utilities’ transmission-access cost recovery; 2) alternative methods (e.g., consideration of multiple seasonal peak demands, demand during different length daily intervals, or peak energy intervals) would be more appropriate to calculate wholesale transmission rates; and 3) transmission-access costs should be non-bypassable, consistent with S.B. 6’s new Section 35.004(c-1) of the Texas Utilities Code (ensuring that large load customers contribute to utilities’ transmission-access cost recovery). [S.B. 6, Section 6(a)]. In addition, S.B. 6 mandates that the PUC evaluate its retail ratemaking practices to ensure that transmission-cost recovery appropriately charges the system costs used by each customer class. [Id. at subsection (b)].

Implications for Load-Intensive Facilities and Grid Planning

S.B. 6 reflects growing concern in Texas over the impact of energy-intensive facilities on grid reliability, especially considering recent expansion in data center, AI compute, and cryptocurrency mining operations. While the bill imposes stricter standards for grid interconnection and introduces new mechanisms to ensure that large loads contribute appropriately to infrastructure costs and reliability planning, it also introduces clearer rules and emergency provisions to avoid grid failures and unfair cost shifting. Assuming the PUC and ERCOT propose thoughtful rule implementation, including engagement with industry, Texas should be able to successfully position itself for the anticipated expansion of large load customers while maintaining grid stability.

Large load customers should review their current and planned interconnection arrangements for compliance with the new disclosure, cost, and backup generation requirements. Entities engaged in behind-the-meter generation or net metering should also be aware of the ERCOT study and PUC approval process.

According to DOE’s analysis, the grid will not be able to sustain an estimated 104 gigawatts (GW) of baseload generation retirements by 2030 and isn’t prepared to meet the growth in electricity demand driven by data centers and artificial intelligence (AI). The DOE expects an additional 100 GW of new peak-hour supply to be needed by then; half of that growth is directly attributable to data centers.

The United States has more than 1,500 GW of generation capacity waiting in interconnection queues and more than enough planned to satisfy 2030 projections in some regions, but roughly 95% of that is renewable energy, and that doesn’t quite jive with the Chris Wright-led DOE’s insistence on fossil fuels.

“Renewables have been subsidized while dispatchable energy sources such as coal, oil and gas, and nuclear have been minimized by environmental activism that hinders American energy production, and renewables cannot power a 24/7 AI infrastructure,” a “fact sheet” provided by the DOE states. The U.S. fossil fuel industry benefits from an estimated $760 billion each year through subsidies, tax breaks, and unpriced externalities; that stat didn’t make the PDF.

The DOE estimates that 209 GW of new generation will come online by 2030 but laments that only 22 GW of that is firm, baseload generation. Even assuming no retirements, the feds’ model found that outage risk in several regions rises more than 30-fold within the next five years. Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies, the report insists, and the queue alone cannot close the dependable capacity deficit.

However, if you’ve been paying attention to what’s happening in Texas, you know that box of fireworks is more smoke than it is sizzle.

Why the DOE is Wrong

They say that everything is bigger in Texas, except for the risk of power outages. Nobody who is paying attention says that anymore.

The Lone Star State is preparing for one of its hottest summers on record and a new all-time high peak load, a record that now gets reset more frequently than a Donkey Kong machine outside of a free quarter factory. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) estimates that the state’s peak power demand could increase by 50,000 megawatts (MW), or about 60%, by 2030. Considering how sweltering summers in 2022 and 2023 tested the Texas grid, one might assume that grid reliability is already an issue in ERCOT and is likely to get worse.

But in 2024, the grid operator did not issue any general calls for conservation, and ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas anticipates an even lower risk of a power supply emergency this summer, from 16% during the hour of peak demand in 2024 to less than 1% in 2025.

At an ERCOT board of directors meeting last month, Vegas gave credit to planning changes and an influx of more than 9,600 MW of new capacity that came online since last year. Most of that is utility-scale solar (about 5,400 MW) and battery energy storage (around 3,800 MW); another 250 MW or so came from wind power. Texas lost a net of more than 360 MW of gas-powered capacity in the same span.

If Energy Secretary Chris Wright is correct in his analysis of the role intermittent resources play in a stable grid, what’s happening in Texas shouldn’t be possible. Yet…

“The state of the grid is strong,” Vegas told the board. “It is as reliable as it has ever been. It is as ready for the challenges of extreme weather… I feel confident that we are ready for this upcoming summer season.”

Developers do want to build gas-fired plants in Texas, and some are in the works, but the cold reality of our current predicament is such that solar and storage are cheaper and faster to get online, despite all the handwringing over “green scams” in Washington. Renewables met more than half of Texas’s peak electricity demand for multiple days last month, and there are hundreds of gigawatts more of solar, storage, and wind on the way as developers flock to the distant blue light of the nation’s premier unregulated electricity market.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ChatGPT-Image-Jul-8-2025-11_15_50-AM.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 14:20:53.125469

North Carolina is already experiencing that trend. Chantal just joined a growing list of tropical systems that have a caused historic flooding in the state.

On Monday morning, a section of the Haw River in the state's Piedmont crested at a record level. The previous highest crest at the Bynum flood gauge on the river was measured after Hurricane Fran in 1996.

Chantal produced around 7 to 10 inches of rain around the Haw River in less than a day. That's close to two months of average rainfall for the area.

This comes less than a year after Helene set the new flood of record in much of western North Carolina.

And around two weeks before Helene, an unnamed tropical disturbance produced a record amount of rainfall near the state's southern coast including at Carolina Beach.

The flooding that resulted from the deluge of rain would be considered a once-in-a-lifetime event in the past. According to the National Weather Service, based on past climate data, the rain that fell on Carolina Beach in 2024 has a 1 in 1,000 probability of happening.

These types of flood events are happening more often though. Just seven years ago, Hurricane Florence produced even higher rainfall totals in other parts of the region. Up to 36 inches fell in some southeastern North Carolina communities from that storm in 2018.

In 2016, Hurricane Matthew never made landfall in North Carolina but heavy rain was pulled inland resulting in catastrophic river flooding that lasted for days after the storm.

Other storms without a name caused extensive flooding in some of the same areas in 2010 and 2015. There was also Hurricane Floyd in 1999 that devastated much of eastern North Carolina with flooding.

Heavier rain in a warmer climate

Tropical systems have long made lasting impacts in the Carolinas even before we have reliable weather records. However, there is a clear trend that these storms are getting wetter, and there's a clear link to climate change.

A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. That leads to heavier rain, even in non-tropical systems.

A study at Stony Brook University, published in Science Advances, found that a warming climate enhanced Florence's extreme rainfall in 2018.

The North Carolina Climate Science Report published in 2020 stated: ""Heavy precipitation accompanying hurricanes that pass near or over North Carolina is very likely to increase, which would, in turn, increase the potential for freshwater flooding in the state.""

In a project to help the North Carolina Department of Transportation prepare bridges for future flooding, researchers at North Carolina State University have been studying the impacts of future storms. A simulation based on current warming trends, found Hurricane Florence at the end of this century would produce a maximum rainfall of almost 56 inches, or 20 inches more than when the storm hit in 2018.

Flooding will likely have a more costly impact on the state well before the end of this century though.

An analysis from Climate Central found flood losses in North Carolina will cost 34% more by 2050 than they will now with some of the highest costs not only coming near the coast but also in western North Carolina.

Heavier rainfall is just one of the ways a changing climate is expected to affect hurricanes in the future. A rising sea level will add to the storm surge created by the storms.

While research has not indicated that a warmer climate will increase the number of hurricanes, the North Carolina Climate Science Report and other studies have shown that the intensity of hurricanes will increase.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/chantal_flooded_road_graham_nc,N,,2025-07-08 13:39:28.131394

DALLAS, TEXAS (July 8, 2025) – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that the agency is adding three sites to the Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) which includes Carlisle Village Cleaners in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The NPL is the list of sites of national priority that guide EPA in tackling the nation’s most serious hazardous waste sites.

“Cleaning up our nation’s Superfund sites provides tremendous health and economic benefits to local communities,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “We listened to these communities and using their input EPA determined the need to add these longtime contaminated sites to the National Priorities List. This action ensures we are working to provide clean air, land, and water for all Americans while Powering the Great American Comeback.”

“Today’s action by EPA is an important step in protecting the community surrounding the Carlisle Village Cleaners site from exposure to hazardous chemicals,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “By adding the site to the National Priorities List, at the request of the New Mexico Environment Department, we are committing to working with the state to clean up this site and restore both environmental and economic vitality to the area.”

Carlisle Village Cleaners operated as a dry cleaner from 1953 through 1975 and used tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its byproduct, trichloroethene (TCE), which can travel through the soil and affect indoor air quality in buildings and homes. Several single-family and multi-family residences are located around the site along with various other commercial properties.

Since 2022, EPA and the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) have been conducting indoor air sampling, installing air purifying units, and designing a Vapor Intrusion Mitigation System to identify and remove potential hazardous vapors from properties. With the assistance of NMED, EPA has identified 15 residential properties for VIMS installation and 6 commercial buildings for a soil vapor extraction system installation below ground surface. The installation of both the residential and commercial VIMS is scheduled to begin later this year. By adding this site to the NPL, EPA and state partners can use additional resources and funding to ensure these properties and nearby residents remain free of potential chemical exposure.

This actions support EPA’s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative, which guides EPA efforts to provide clean air, land, and water for all Americans by working to ensure that hazardous sites are cleaned up while also fostering economic growth across the country.

Background

The NPL serves as EPA’s basis for prioritizing Superfund cleanup funding and enforcement actions. Only releases of hazardous substances at sites included on the list are eligible to receive federal funding for long-term, permanent cleanup.

Before EPA adds a site to the National Priorities List, a site must meet EPA’s risk thresholds and be proposed on the Federal Register, prompting a 60-day public comment period. EPA will add the site to the National Priorities List if it continues to meet the listing requirements after the public comment period closes and the agency has responded to any comments.

Additionally, EPA strives to identify “Potentially Responsible Parties” who may also share the costs of cleaning up the contamination at NPL sites and conserve taxpayer dollars.

Stocks in the sector fell on Tuesday. First Solar and Enphase Energy dropped as much as 5%. Wind and solar producer NextEra Energy fell 4% and SolarEdge Technologies lost 3%.

“A non-negligible risk of cancer.” “Significant elevated benzene concentrations.” “Risks to the public.”

That’s how the Ontario government referred to emissions of the carcinogen benzene from the INEOS Styrolution petrochemical plant in Sarnia in 2023 — a year before those emissions sparked a state of emergency for neighbouring Aamjiwnaang First Nation.

Internal documents show Ontario’s Environment Ministry had noted similar concerns since at least 2019. Still, it declined to impose a strict limit on the plant’s benzene levels until the 2024 state of emergency, instead ordering the company to install new emissions-control technology, among other measures.

Benzene is a byproduct of petroleum refining that’s also found in crude oil and fuel. It’s one of the foundational ingredients in plastic that, along with other chemicals, can be used to make anything from food containers to, in INEOS’ case, rubber.

INEOS, which has since shut down its plant in Sarnia, said its benzene emissions were within the limits set by the Ontario government. The plant is one of several dozen petroleum refineries and petrochemical plants in an area of Sarnia known as Chemical Valley. The Ontario government has struggled to control emissions from the facilities for decades, even as Aamjiwnaang First Nation has sounded alarms about how pollution has harmed its members’ health.

Ontario’s Environment Ministry did not answer detailed questions from The Narwhal about the documents and how it regulates air pollution in Chemical Valley. The Narwhal also sent detailed questions to INEOS Styrolution. The company did not answer most of them, but sent a statement saying it prioritizes safety and has “consistently operated within the strict limits” set by the Environment Ministry. “INEOS Styrolution remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health and safety of our employees and the community, and we have consistently adhered to [the Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks’] emissions requirements,” spokesperson April Ludwikowski wrote.

The ministry’s response to the benzene emissions from the INEOS plant is one example of a pattern pieced together by The Narwhal through 250 pages of internal ministry documents, obtained through two freedom of information requests.

The records outline several steps the Ontario government could have taken to address air pollution in Chemical Valley — but didn’t.

As the ministry sent compliance orders, benzene spikes continued

The records obtained by The Narwhal show Ontario’s Environment Ministry made three attempts to cut benzene emissions from INEOS through directives called compliance orders. The ministry uses compliance orders to compel companies to fix issues, or take certain steps to prevent potential harm to people and the environment.

In the years leading up to the 2024 emergency in Aamjiwnaang, the ministry sent three orders to INEOS — one in 2019, another in 2020 and a third in 2023. The orders urged INEOS to gradually lower its benzene emissions closer to Ontario’s health-based air quality guidelines.

But earlier in 2019, the ministry had also sent INEOS another set of guidelines. These ones were based on benzene standards in Texas, which experts have criticized for being too loose and putting residents at higher risk of cancer. They recommend benzene levels remain below an hourly average of up to 580 micrograms per cubic metre, which is three times more than the levels recorded in Aamjiwnaang as people went to the emergency room in 2024.

An INEOS Styrolution spokesperson told The Narwhal the 580 micrograms per cubic metre was an “established” emissions limit set by the ministry, and that the company never breached it. The Environment Ministry did not answer questions about how it applied those numbers to INEOS.

“Ontario wasn’t looking at all the cumulative impacts, which we’ve been saying for decades now,” Aamjiwnaang Chief Janelle Nahmabin said. “[It was] just allowing exceedances and not looking out for the health and safety of our community or the environment.”

Despite the orders, elevated levels of benzene continued to waft across the road from INEOS to Aamjiwnaang for years.

Though some of the steps outlined in the first two orders helped, one air monitor near the plant showed emissions of benzene that “increased each year,” according to the 2023 order. The same document noted six incidents in 2022 and 2023 where air monitors detected “significantly elevated” concentrations of benzene from INEOS, including some where air monitors recorded levels even higher than the ones that prompted the 2024 state of emergency.

Sometimes the emissions came from spills, according to the 2023 order. Other times, they came from planned maintenance or the “prolonged storage” of waste with benzene in it. None technically violated the laws governing the plant.

“INEOS [is] concerned that orders require them to do too much, too soon,” said one late 2023 briefing document prepared by the Environment Ministry. “They believed that since they were complying with the [standard], they shouldn’t have to do more.”

INEOS and the ministry didn’t answer questions about the orders.

The province sent INEOS a fourth order in spring 2024, as benzene levels spiked again, sickening people in Aamjiwnaang. That order required INEOS to notify the public if readings of benzene spiked, develop another plan to “address benzene from wastewater” and investigate where the carcinogen might be coming from.

High levels of benzene were reported again a week later, prompting Aamjiwnaang to issue its state of emergency.

INEOS temporarily shut down the plant following the ministry’s 2024 order, five years after the ministry first raised red flags about its benzene emissions. The company soon announced it would close the plant entirely due to the “economics of the facility within a wider industry context.” It said the situation was not related to the benzene spikes.

Chief Nahmabin said the Ontario government sent the orders without checking with Aamjiwnaang to make sure they were effective — a “big miss,” as the community has asked time and again to be involved in decisions about its territory.

More and more, Aamjiwnaang is taking the regulation of industry into its own hands, writing air standards for the reserve and working with the federal government on a pilot project to address environmental racism. “We cannot wait for governments to be the one that acts for us,” Nahmabin said.

Ontario skipped a planned review of its benzene standards for petroleum and petrochemical plants

Though Ontario has strict air quality standards for benzene, it said it’s not “technically and economically feasible” for all industrial facilities to meet them. So some plants follow different sets of rules called technical standards, which require them to use the best available equipment to lower emissions as much as possible. Seven facilities in the Sarnia area, including INEOS Styrolution’s now-shuttered plant, are regulated by technical standards for the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries.

The standards were penned under the former Liberal government in 2016. At the time, the documents obtained by The Narwhal show, the Environment Ministry didn’t realize how much facilities were actually emitting. Industry-provided figures were “underestimated,” according to an internal memo from late 2023. They pointed to INEOS Styrolution as an example, saying the company was emitting maximum concentrations of benzene 15 times higher than what the province was aware of.

Company spokesperson Ludwikowski said INEOS maintains “full transparency” in its emissions reporting. Ludwikowski did not directly address questions about the estimates, but denied that the company “underreported our emissions or misled the regulator.”

“Property line emissions monitoring at our Sarnia site is conducted by independent third parties, in accordance with [Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks] requirements, ensuring there is no internal influence over the results,” Ludwikowski said in a statement.

The Narwhal sent questions about the problem, and direct quotes from the documents, to every company in the Sarnia area that operates under a petrochemical or petroleum industry technical standard. That list also includes Imperial Oil, NOVA Chemicals, Shell Canada, Suncor Energy and Diamond Petrochemicals. Imperial said it “complies with air emissions reporting requirements under the applicable regulations” but “wouldn’t be able to speak to documents that we haven’t seen.” The rest did not respond.

When the government first wrote the technical standards in 2016, the ministry committed to reviewing them by 2023. The Ford government did not follow through on that plan after it was elected in 2018, despite a warning in the 2023 briefing that said updates are “needed.” The same document also noted companies would likely push back.

“Industry is looking for further simplifications and relaxations,” the memo said. “Will be opposed to more stringent requirements.”

The Ford government also skipped a planned update to a policy that, among other things, was aimed at addressing the cumulative effects of benzene emissions from multiple facilities in both the Sarnia area and Hamilton. The previous Liberal government introduced the policy in spring 2018 and committed to reviewing it by 2020. The Progressive Conservatives formed government in 2020 and did not follow up on the plan.

Someone ‘directed’ Ontario’s Environment Ministry to soften sulphur dioxide rules

The province did pass legislation aimed at tackling sulphur dioxide emissions in general in 2022, but the 2023 briefing said the Environment Ministry was “directed” to give industry in the Sarnia area more time to comply, and to make some requirements in the rules “less stringent.” That’s despite concerns from Aamjiwnaang that the extensions granted to two companies in particular, Imperial Oil and Shell, would allow high levels of sulphur dioxide emissions to continue for years longer.

The document did not say who gave the ministry that direction. The regulation’s listing on the environmental registry noted, “The ministry has carefully considered the comments received during the consultation period, and we are extending the implementation of some of the requirements by two years from the end of 2026 to 2028 as facilities stated they need more time to make these significant changes to their operations.”

The Environment Ministry didn’t answer questions about its reasoning for the decisions detailed in the briefing, and how it weighed Aamjiwnaang’s health concerns against pushback from industry.

Ontario backed off a plan to tighten rules around sulphur dioxide: docs

The records don’t just show problems with benzene: the Progressive Conservative government also abandoned one proposed plan it said would dramatically cut emissions of another harmful pollutant.

Sulphur dioxide, which smells like burnt matches, is best known as one of the chemicals that causes acid rain. But when people breathe in a lot of it at once, it can also irritate the human respiratory system.

Ontario has regulations limiting how much of the pollutant companies can emit, and has tightened them in recent years. But some facilities can’t meet those standards — and that includes two companies that make carbon black, a powder used in paint and rubber, with sulphur dioxide as a byproduct. One of those companies, Cabot Corporation, is located in Sarnia.

From 2018 to 2020 Cabot asked the Ontario government for an alternative to the regulations, the late 2023 memo said. Vanessa Craigie, a spokesperson for Cabot, said in a written statement that the company wanted more “flexibility” in the province’s timelines so it could develop and test technology to reduce its sulphur dioxide emissions.

In June 2023, Ontario unveiled its answer to that request: a proposed technical standard for the carbon black industry. If finalized, by 2028 it would mandate both carbon black facilities in Ontario, including Cabot in Sarnia, to install technology that slashes sulphur dioxide pollution, the province said. By 2030, the companies would have to reduce their emissions by 95 per cent, meeting a new set of weekly and annual limits.

At the time, Aamjiwnaang told the province those deadlines gave companies too much time to continue emitting the chemical, and companies should already have installed known technology to emit less.

Industry also had concerns about the technical standard, albeit different ones, according to the 2023 briefing note. Cabot told the ministry it would be “easier” for them to just follow the existing air standard instead. Craigie said the company is committed to environmental responsibility and developing new technology, but that the technical standard was “more complex” than the existing standards, “making compliance more challenging within the given timeframe.”

The ministry never finalized the plan, and did not answer questions from The Narwhal about why. Craigie said, “it was deemed not the optimal approach,” and that the ministry opted to work with facilities on specific plans to cut their emissions.

Craigie said Cabot’s final plan to “significantly” reduce sulphur dioxide emissions has received a green light from the ministry and from Aamjiwnaang, and will use “state of the art” technology piloted over the last few years. “In addition, Cabot is committed to voluntarily reducing its operations in order to reduce our contribution to the regional [sulphur dioxide] levels,” Craigie said. “Cabot will reduce operations when regional [sulphur dioxide] concentrations exceed certain levels at nearby monitoring stations.”

Nahmabin said Cabot has worked to form a better relationship with Aamjinwaang in recent years, sharing more information and responding to concerns quickly.

“That’s what we’re looking for with our neighbours,” Nahmabin said.

The grant program, created and funded by Congress through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is designed to provide critical support to communities disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change. Attorney General James and the coalition argue EPA’s abrupt and unlawful termination of the program and cancellation of grants has already caused widespread harm across their states, particularly in low-income communities and communities of color, and are urging the court to block the program termination while the lawsuit continues.

“These climate and environmental justice grants are a lifeline for communities that have been historically left behind,” said Attorney General James. “From Buffalo to Far Rockaway, New Yorkers were counting on these funds to access clean energy, clean up air pollution, and prepare for climate disasters. When the federal government breaks its promises to our most vulnerable communities, the consequences can be devastating, even deadly. My office is fighting to ensure this grant program is restored so that New Yorkers are protected as we combat the climate crisis.”

In the brief filed today in Appalachian Voices v. EPA, Attorney General James and the coalition emphasize that by terminating this grant program, the federal government is inflicting serious, lasting harm on vulnerable communities already grappling with disproportionate pollution burdens and the escalating effects of climate change. These communities, which are often low-income, communities of color, indigenous, or in rural areas, face overlapping environmental and public health crises. The attorneys general explain that these challenges have only been made worse by historical discriminatory policies, including racial segregation, redlining, and a systemic lack of investment in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These communities are under-resourced, have less access to infrastructure like clean drinking water and sanitation, and end up bearing the brunt of the burden from extreme weather disasters, since they are less equipped to recover from devastating events or easily adapt to a changing climate.

In 2022, Congress created the grant program under the Inflation Reduction Act, mandating that EPA distribute $3 billion in funding specifically to help address these disparities. In New York alone, 22 grantees were awarded more than $70 million in funding to carry out projects to protect vulnerable residents from extreme heat, flooding, air pollution, and other environmental hazards. Another grantee, Fordham University in the Bronx, was awarded $50 million to provide as grants to community-based organizations in New York, as well as New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight Indigenous Nations, for environmental justice projects. Grantees, often in partnership with non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and city agencies, would use the funds to protect residents from extreme weather events in Albany, Rochester, and Buffalo; combat flooding and excess heat in the Bronx and Yonkers; protect the Rockaways from storm surges; and more.

Now, the sudden termination of these grants has forced grantees to lay off staff, halt programming, and freeze hiring. Attorney General James and the coalition argue that EPA’s mass cancellation of the environmental and climate justice grant program violates clear congressional mandates and fundamental constitutional principles. Congress directed the EPA to distribute these funds using mandatory language in the Inflation Reduction Act, leaving the agency no discretion to unilaterally withdraw support. The attorneys general emphasize that the executive branch cannot override Congress’s appropriations decisions based on its own policy preferences, and that in doing so, the administration violated the U.S. Constitution.

Attorney General James and the coalition are urging the court to grant the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction and ensure that the environmental justice grants will remain available for the communities that so desperately need them.

In May, Ford had sounded the alarm over the potential for the U.S. government to eliminate production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries using Chinese technology in the House version of legislation.

Ford said Tuesday the Marshall, Michigan, plant that is slated to employ 1,700 workers ""is on track to qualify for the production tax credit ― a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.""

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026. Ford’s factory would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL.

The tax bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives would have barred tax credits for batteries produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and others, praised the final bill for revising language on a battery production tax credit that ""preserved auto-related advanced manufacturing across the country and prohibited Chinese companies from eligibility.""

More: Expanded LG plant in Holland could help fix rural EV charging crisis

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. The plant has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

The sweeping tax and budget legislation took aim at EVs on a number of fronts.

It ends the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing new electric vehicles on September 30, as well as a $4,000 used EV credit.

Separately, U.S. automakers stand to receive significant benefits from the law that also eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy shortfalls, which makes it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Many of those affected by the flood were uninsured, as standard home insurance in the US doesn’t cover flood damage.","The deluge in Texas last week ranks as one of the deadliest and costliest flash floods in US history, highlighting the mounting threat to communities that aren’t prepared for extreme rainfall.

It’s too early to know the exact toll of the flooding in Texas, which killed more than 100 people. But a preliminary estimate from AccuWeather Inc. puts the total damage and economic loss at $18 billion to $22 billion, a figure that includes direct and indirect impacts as well as long-term effects on businesses like tourism.

“Flood risks are escalating under climate change,” said Megan Mullin, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. “We’re getting wetter storms, and they’re becoming really concentrated in time in many places, and our infrastructure isn’t set up to protect people from those kinds of storms.”

From 1980 through last year, flooding killed hundreds of people nationwide and inflicted at least $203.3 billion in losses, according National Centers for Environmental Information data adjusted for inflation. That’s about $50 billion more than the toll of wildfires over the same period. The US stopped collecting this data, which captures only direct losses from disasters that cost $1 billion or more, after President Donald Trump took office for his second term.

Tropical storms and hurricanes are also responsible for many flood-related deaths in the US. A year ago, 250 people died in Hurricane Helene, most of whom perished in floods the storm unleashed across Appalachia. It’s possible that the mortalities from the Texas floods may be ultimately categorized as indirect losses from Tropical Storm Barry.

Here are the top five US flood events by economic losses, excluding the recent Texas disaster:

1. Midwest Flooding, Summer 1993

More than three decades ago, the upper Mississippi River Basin in the US Midwest experienced the costliest non-tropical inland flood event in the US on record. Known as “The Great Flood of 1993,” it resulted in at least 48 deaths and caused an estimated $46.3 billion in direct losses. Persistent, heavy rains caused the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries to flood, wreaking havoc across nine states and damaging or destroying over 50,000 homes.

The flooding was so destructive that it prompted governors from all nine states to agree to a plan to pay to relocate people out of flood zones.

2. Midwest Flooding, Summer 2008

Major flooding along the Mississippi River and its tributaries resulted in at least 24 fatalities and $14.9 billion in damages in states across the Midwest, with Iowa being hardest hit. Heavy rainfall unleashed significant agricultural losses and property damage, and major levees in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids were breached, resulting in forced evacuations.

Damages were long-lasting. In Cedar Rapids, over 40% of the businesses in the flood zone still lacked power even months later.

3. Missouri River and North Central Flooding, March 2019

Affecting much of the Midwest, the historic flood caused widespread damage to agriculture, roads and bridges. Triggered in part by a powerful snowstorm and warming temperatures that intensified snowmelt, the flood resulted in at least three deaths and $13.4 billion in losses. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts called it the most widespread disaster the state had faced.

The deluge damaged the Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, the third US military base to be hit by a billion-dollar disaster event in six months. Flooding also closed a stretch of Interstate 29 through northwestern Missouri for several months and disrupted some railroad lines used to deliver ethanol to Texas refineries.

4. Louisiana Flooding, August 2016

Causing at least 13 deaths and $13.3 billion in damages, the flood wreaked havoc across southern Louisiana after the region received 20 to 30 inches of rainfall over several days. Dubbed “the Great Flood of 2016,” the disaster damaged or destroyed over 50,000 homes and 20,000 businesses.

Many of those affected by the flood were uninsured, as standard home insurance in the US doesn’t cover flood damage. One report estimated that at least 80% of the damaged homes lacked coverage through a government program.

5. Mississippi River, Midwest and Southern Flooding, July 2019

Only months after the devastating March deluge, persistent heavy rains caused additional flooding across the Southern Plains, resulting in at least four deaths and costing the area $7.6 billion.

Barge traffic along the Mississippi River was disrupted by very high water levels that summer, with hundreds of barges stalled and railroads and highways also closed, putting a halt to the farm-belt economy. Flooded farmland in Indiana and Ohio also reduced crop planting by millions of acres.

Extreme rainfall events are increasing across the U.S. as temperatures rise, she said.

“We are in a more extreme climate,” Faranda said.","Editor’s Note: This article originally appeared at Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. It is republished with permission. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Heavy rains over the weekend that pushed the Guadalupe River in Texas’ Hill Country to its second-highest height on record had by Tuesday resulted in more than 100 reported deaths, including 28 children from the all-girl Camp Mystic. But as search and rescue teams and volunteers sweep the banks of the river for missing people, the number of confirmed deaths is expected to grow.

Climate scientists said the torrential downpours on July 4 exemplify the devastating outcomes of weather intensified by a warming atmosphere. These disasters, they said, will become more frequent as people around the world continue to burn fossil fuels and heat the planet.

“This is not a one-off anymore,” said Claudia Benitez-Nelson, a climate scientist at the University of South Carolina. Extreme rainfall events are increasing across the U.S. as temperatures rise, she said.

Warmer temperatures allow for the atmosphere to hold more water vapor, producing heavier rainfalls, she and other climate scientists said. This coupled with old infrastructure and ineffective warning systems can be disastrous.

“It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes,” the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2021. “At the global scale, the intensification of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold as it warms about 7% per 1°C of global warming.”

The U.S. government’s fifth National Climate Assessment, released in November 2023, says that “the number of days with extreme precipitation will continue to increase as the climate warms” and that “these changes in precipitation patterns can lead to increased flood hazards, impacting infrastructure, ecosystems, and communities.”

Central Texas is infamous for its flash flooding and arid soil, hard-packed ground into which water does not easily infiltrate. So when rain hits the ground, it runs off the region’s hilly terrain and canyons and accumulates into creeks and rivers rapidly, overwhelming them, causing them to rise quickly.

The flash flooding wasn’t a result of a full-strength storm, Benitez-Nelson said, but a remnant of a tropical storm. “That, to me, is really sad and deeply alarming,” Benitez-Nelson said. “Climate change is turning ordinary weather into these disasters.”

Damp remnants of Tropical Storm Barry moved up from eastern Mexico as humid air also moved north from Mexico’s southwestern coast, stalling over Texas’ Hill Country. The warm air in both the low and high levels of the atmosphere is a recipe for intense rainfall, said John Nielsen-Gammon, the state’s appointed climatologist for more than 20 years.

He and his colleagues compiled a list of all the rainfall events in Texas that produced more than 20 inches of rain a few years ago. One common feature the climatologists found was when wind blew from south to north, or when moisture was brought northward from the tropics, he said. “That sets up the possibility of very heavy rainfall,” Nielsen-Gammon said. He concluded in a report last year that extreme rain in Texas could increase 10 percent by 2036.

Increased moisture from the tropics is driven by warming oceans.

The oceans absorb over 90 percent of excess heat in the atmosphere produced by greenhouse gas emissions, warming ocean temperatures down to depths of 2,000 meters. Tropical storms gain strength from heat and evaporate more quickly at higher temperatures, adding more water vapor to the atmosphere, Nielsen-Gammon said.

A study released Monday by ClimaMeter, a project funded by the European Union and the French National Center for Scientific Research, found that meteorological conditions leading up to Friday morning’s floods were warmer and 7 percent wetter than similar events of the past. Natural variability alone can’t explain the changes in rain associated with the exceptional weather, the report said, and points to human-caused climate change as one of the main drivers of the event.

ClimaMeter’s analysis shows the difference in surface temperature, precipitation and wind speed between the present climate from 1987 and earlier decades, from 1950 to 1986.

“Climate change loads the dice toward more frequent and more intense floods,” said Davide Faranda, one of the report’s authors who is research director of climate physics in the Laboratoire de Science du Climat et de l’Environnement, part of the French National Center for Scientific Research. “The flash flood that tore through Camp Mystic at night, when people were most vulnerable, shows the deadly cost of underestimating this shift.”

He added: “A 7 percent increase of rain is a lot, but doesn’t really make the tragedy. If you have a good alert system, if the population knows the risk related to climate change for this weather phenomena and can take them into account, not minimize them, then you can save lives, because it’s not double the amount of precipitation, it’s not three times. It’s something that we can handle if we are prepared.”

Other factors in the flooding death toll such as land use change, urban sprawl and warning system failures weren’t analyzed and may have further amplified the disaster, the report said.

“We are in a more extreme climate,” Faranda said. “And every year, year after year, we make it more extreme by burning more fossil fuels. … These extremes now start to touch the limits of what is normal life on this planet, in terms of humans, in terms of infrastructure that we built with the old climate, in terms of resilience of the ecosystem.”

Initial estimates for the damage and economic loss of this disaster will reach beyond $18 billion, according to AccuWeather.

Petronas LNG has signed onto a 20-year sales and purchase agreement with Venture Global to deliver LNG produced from U.S. natural gas plays. Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to Venture’s liquefaction terminals on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coast, then chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit to liquify it, reduce gas pressure and make it stable for shipping.

Petronas LNG is a subsidiary of Malaysian state-owned oil and gas company Petronas. Malaysia itself is a significant LNG exporter and the second highest producer of petroleum products in southeast Asia, according to reports.

Under the 20-year agreement, Petronas will purchase one million metric tons of LNG annually produced from Venture’s CP2LNG facility. This latest purchase follows an earlier transaction in which Petronas agreed to acquire one million tons of LNG supply from Venture’s Plaquemines terminal on the Gulf of Mexico Coast.

Venture Global recently closed on a $3 billion bank loan facility to complete the building project for the CP2 facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Work on the CP2 terminal, which began in 2023, is happening along the Calcasieu Ship Channel, where the company’s first LNG project, Calcasieu Pass (pictured above), started production in 2022.

Plaquemines LNG was completed and achieved first LNG production in December 2024. Altogether, Venture Global’s construction and development goal is to produce more than 100 million metric tons of LNG per year.

The U.S. is the world’s top producer and exporter of LNG at close to 15 billion cubic feet per day, with some 28 billion cubic feet of daily capacity in various stages of operation and construction, according to the federal Department of Energy. Due to the exponential growth of domestic gas production in the various plays such as the Bakken, Marcellus and Utica shales, the nation became a net LNG exporter in 2016.

Last year, the financial value of total U.S. LNG exports topped $28 billion in trade revenue. The transactional value was higher, at above $30 billion annually, in 2022 and 2023.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/07/686d20e4f60c7e3120a4bbb1-venture_global_lng_calcasieu_pass.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-07-08 15:16:26.349988

Ford Motor said Tuesday it believes its planned $3 billion Michigan electric vehicle battery plant, which is 60% complete, will qualify for production tax credits after a massive tax and budget bill revised the rules.

In May, Ford had sounded the alarm over the potential for the U.S. government to eliminate production tax credits that support the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries using Chinese technology in the House version of legislation.

Ford said Tuesday the Marshall, Michigan, plant that is slated to employ 1,700 workers ""is on track to qualify for the production tax credit ― a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.""

Ford said the plant, which was announced in February 2023, is expected to begin producing batteries in 2026. Ford’s factory would make battery cells using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL.

The tax bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives would have barred tax credits for batteries produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

The Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers, a group representing General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and others, praised the final bill for revising language on a battery production tax credit that ""preserved auto-related advanced manufacturing across the country and prohibited Chinese companies from eligibility.""

Ford received a reduced incentive package from Michigan last year for the battery plant after it cut expected production there to match slowing demand for electric vehicles. The plant has drawn scrutiny from some lawmakers for its ties to the Chinese company.

The sweeping tax and budget legislation took aim at EVs on a number of fronts.

It ends the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing new electric vehicles on September 30, as well as a $4,000 used EV credit.

Separately, U.S. automakers stand to receive significant benefits from the law that also eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy shortfalls, which makes it easier for automakers to build gas-powered vehicles.

Kerr County’s decision to forgo an early warning system is an example of how many communities are ill-equipped to protect themselves from once-unfathomable extremes, experts said.
They warned Trump administration cuts will undermine flood and other disaster preparation as climate-fueled events reset expectations for worst-imagined outcomes.
McPhearson said the same type of lapses contributed to the disaster that wiped out Lahaina on Maui during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, whose early warning system was not activated.
Castillo said FEMA has tried to raise awareness about early warning systems and encouraged governments to invest in them.","But the weather service and its parent organization are reeling from mass layoffs and early retirements pushed by President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, and the sprawling tax bill that he signed last week canceled more than $200 million in spending that was supposed to improve weather forecasting and make communities more resilient to disasters.

Federal grants to help communities afford flood warning systems are also drying up after the Trump administration halted two main programs that once funded such work. And the White House acknowledged Monday that it’s still weighing the fate of the nation’s premier disaster responder, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, more than five months after Trump said that “I think we’re going to recommend that FEMA go away.”

Even without final answers about the cause of the Texas death toll, one longtime emergency manager said one fact is clear: “That many people did not need to die,” said Michael Coen, who served as FEMA’s chief of staff during the Biden and Obama administrations. He said Kerr County should have invested in better flood defenses or, at the very least, relocated camping cabins away from the river.

The gutting of the national infrastructure around weather emergencies comes at the same time that climate change is making severe disasters more common and more dangerous, according to studies and past warnings from the U.S. government – including during the first Trump administration.

“The frequency and the severity associated with these types of events all across the country have been substantiated over and over again,” said David Maurstad, who ran FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program before leaving the agency last year. “I don’t know how anybody can ignore that.”

On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected attempts to connect the Texas fatalities to Trump’s policies, saying: “Many Democrat elected officials are trying to turn this into a political game, and it is not.”

The Trump administration has proposed cutting $2.2 billion from the weather service’s parent organization, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in its fiscal 2026 budget request, affecting virtually every program at the agency. It would eliminate the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research — NOAA’s main research arm, which Republicans say has been too focused on climate change — and shift much of its responsibilities to the NWS and National Ocean Service.

Many local governments’ efforts to prepare for and respond to extreme weather are already strapped by limited resources.

Kerr County — where the median household income is just under $68,000, according to U.S. Census data, and the county’s annual budget is a modest $67 million — had, in fact, considered installing a flood warning system that could have alerted campers and residents to evacuate. That was back in 2017, in the aftermath of another major flood. But officials ultimately opted against doing so, citing its cost after the county failed to win a grant to help pay for it, according to reports in The New York Times and other publications.

Kerr County’s decision to forgo an early warning system is an example of how many communities are ill-equipped to protect themselves from once-unfathomable extremes, experts said. They warned Trump administration cuts will undermine flood and other disaster preparation as climate-fueled events reset expectations for worst-imagined outcomes.

Climate scientists said hotter temperatures driven by rising greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels likely contributed to heavy rainfall in Kerr County. A warmer atmosphere absorbs more moisture, which is later released in torrents that exacerbate floods and lead to mudslides.

Climate change likely increased total precipitation between 7 and 20 percent, said Michael Wehner, a senior scientist in the applied mathematics and computational research division at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

Meteorological conditions were up to 7 percent wetter due to human-caused climate change, said ClimaMeter, a team of European researchers that conducts rapid analyses of extreme weather events. World Weather Attribution, a global leader in those so-called attribution studies, said the climate link was unequivocal.

“[G]iven the huge amount of scientific evidence on the link between fossil fuel-driven warming and rainfall, we don’t need to wait for an attribution study – extreme downpours like these are exactly what science expects in a rapidly warming world,” Friederike Otto, climate science professor at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London, said in a statement.

Still, officials in Kerr County said the danger was unexpected.

“We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what’s happened here. None whatsoever,” Judge Rob Kelly, the county’s top elected official, told CBS News.

Maurstad said communities often resist spending on measures to protect against future disasters, instead embracing wishful thinking that the next emergency will be less severe – even as climate change has shown trends heading in the opposite direction.

“The whole mindset needs to change,” he said. “It should not be acceptable just to be able to be ready to respond and then recover the best we can.”

And the Trump administration’s culling of several key programs to help communities prepare for disasters and pay for those improvements is likely to make the situation worse.

Firings, retirements and voluntary resignations created a workforce shortage that NWS is trying to address. The Commerce Department recently exempted NWS from a department-wide hiring freeze to fill critical roles.

Leavitt said Monday that NWS “did its job.” While the San Antonio office has one vacancy, she said that NWS “offices were fully staffed” in San Angelo, Texas, and that San Antonio had 11 forecasters. She said comments blaming Trump or NWS staffing levels for the deaths “are depraved and despicable.”

Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Monday urged the Commerce Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into whether staffing shortages contributed to the loss of life in Texas.

But retired Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as NOAA’s acting administrator during the first Trump administration, argued in a blog post that, while short-staffing has had impacts at the service, it likely wasn’t the prime factor in the flood problems. And he said that implementing artificial intelligence – not more personnel – could strengthen preparedness by improving forecasts and automating the delivery of information to emergency managers and the public.

Such a tool, Gallaudet argued, could have delivered “the right data, a better model, and an automated emergency alerting system that may have given the citizens in Central Texas a more specific flood warning 24 hours in advance, allowing them to move to high ground when they could.”

Still, Maurstad said Trump’s decision to scrap billions of dollars of grants through FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program reversed 25 years of progress to boost poorly funded federal efforts that help communities prepare for disasters.

Trump also has denied what had up until now been routine requests for federal assistance after a disaster, said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. Trump has not approved hazard mitigation grant program funding across several states Berginnis works with, depriving them of a key federal vehicle to finance early warning systems.

“I’m just shaking my head, because it’s like, God, the programs that we have to help in that situation are the ones that are being curtailed by the president,” he said. “It dishonors the lives lost if we don’t change behavior. At some point we have to learn lessons.”

A White House official said the Trump administration is “working with states to assist them in identifying projects and drawing down balances in a way that makes the nation more resilient.” The official said it is assessing states ability to use those dollars in light of “large unobligated balances across the board.”

The early warning system in Kerr County would have cost $1 million, Coen estimated. That’s a significant sum for a cash-strapped local government – but it pales in comparison to the $18 billion to $22 billion of total economic losses, according to AccuWeather.

That system would likely have saved lives by triggering sirens and communications for people to move out of harm’s way when NWS issued its flash flood warning at 1:14 a.m. July 4.

The problem is not limited to Kerr County, said Timon McPhearson, a lead author to the most recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment finalized in 2023.

McPhearson said the same type of lapses contributed to the disaster that wiped out Lahaina on Maui during the 2023 Hawaii wildfires, whose early warning system was not activated. It speaks to a broader inability for U.S. communities to cope with the ballooning risks and costs climate change poses, he said.

“You can’t estimate whether an event is going to have mass casualties or not,” said McPhearson, who is director of the Urban Systems Lab at New York University. “If this is the kind of response that’s needed — investment in early warning systems — then where’s the money going to come from?”

Less of it appears likely to come from the federal government, emergency managers said.

It’s possible some federal funds, like disaster assistance, will migrate to other departments, said Carlos Castillo, who was deputy FEMA administrator for resilience in Trump’s first administration. He said FEMA would play a role in the Texas recovery, too.

Castillo said FEMA has tried to raise awareness about early warning systems and encouraged governments to invest in them. He said many “shoulder” communities — meaning those that are not directly affected by disasters but share qualities with the ones that are — bolster their defenses after devastating events.

But he also said states cannot go it alone and that many communities do not properly budget for disasters.

“It’s impossible for a state to have the number of resources for a catastrophic event,” said Castillo, who is senior vice president of Tidal Basin Group, an emergency management consulting firm. “It’s a challenge to get the communities that haven’t been affected to put money aside.”",https://static.politico.com/94/b7/4598a64440a6add11a8bf1e08459/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2222872780,N,,2025-07-08 13:38:33.647112

On that day, Steyer changed, too. The company he’d founded, Farallon Capital, had long invested in fossil fuels. But Steyer realized climate change was “happening much faster than most of us imagined,” he wrote of the experience. He started speaking out, lobbied politicians and established a family foundation to support alternative systems, such as organic agriculture. Tom and his wife, Kathryn, also endowed the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy at Stanford University, where young entrepreneurs are developing innovations such as hydrogen-fuel systems for heavy trucks, safer and more powerful lithium batteries, and fertilizers made of almond shells.

In 2012, Steyer stepped down from Farallon. “I have a passion to push for what I believe is the right thing,” he told The Globe and Mail.

Steyer himself became the biggest donor in Democratic party history and helped convince Barack Obama to veto the northern section of the Keystone oil-sands pipeline. Disillusioned by politicians’ reluctance to act, he ran for president in 2020, promising to use executive power to enact a green new deal.

Steyer had little impact on the campaign and dropped out after focusing all his attention on delegates in South Carolina – who voted for Joe Biden.

In one of President Donald Trump’s first executive orders, he eliminated a centralized system that Jimmy Carter initially set up to issue regulations governing environmental impact statements. Instead, he called on each agency to issue its own regulations, which seems to have caused the predictable amount of confusion. I’ve examined the new regulations from three agencies: the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Department of Transportation (DOT), which happened to be the first ones that I saw. There seems to be little rhyme or reason in the variations.

Variations involving other agencies may be even greater. According to Earthjustice, some agencies have adopted new regulations while others have opted for non-binding guidelines.

Shortchanging the Environment

When he told agencies to make their own regulations, Trump also made it clear that environmental considerations were to play little role. Instead, he said, “agencies must prioritize efficiency and certainty over any other objectives” to the extent allowed by law. This section of the order is entitled “Unleashing Energy Dominance through Efficient Permitting,” with “energy dominance” being Trump’s phrase for dramatically expanding fossil fuels.

Agencies got the message in the sense that none of the regulations I examined cites the policies that Congress articulated in NEPA or show any concern about potentially overlooking important environmental impacts.

One area of commonality involves the definition of effects. All three departments say:

Effects should generally not be considered if they are remote in time, geographically remote, or the product of a lengthy causal chain. Effects do not include those effects that the agency has no ability to prevent due to the limits of its regulatory authority, or that would occur regardless of the proposed action, or that would need to be initiated by a third party.

This language seems designed to exclude consideration of impacts on climate change and other systemic environmental risks.

Reducing Public Participation

All three regulations seem to provide less scope for public content than prior regulations. They all do require an opportunity to comment early in the process of issuing an environmental impact statement, as required by the statute, but whether there will be any further opportunity for public input varies. There are also variations in what opportunity for public input, if any, exists in the preparation of a more streamlined document, an environmental assessment:

DOD requires further public input at some point after the initial notice during the preparation of an impact statement, but not necessarily the opportunity to comment on the draft impact statement. It doesn’t mention public comment for an environmental assessment.

DOE makes public comment after the initial scoping announcement optional. Public input into the preparation of an environmental assessment is also optional.

DOT calls for as much public input into preparation of an environmental assessment as “practicable,” but not necessarily an opportunity to comment on or even see a draft of the document. DOT makes disclosure and comment on a draft impact statement discretionary except when required by a statute other than NEPA, which appears to be true for some sub-agencies within DOT.

Notably, CEQ has approved a plan to keep draft environmental impact statements for fossil fuel projects secret to streamline the process in light of Trump’s purported “energy emergency.”

Discordant Regulations

I had thought the agencies might all issue nearly identical regulations written by the White House. That doesn’t seem to have happened. There are certainly a lot of commonalities, but there are also significant differences, not limited to issues like public notice. Here are some other examples:

DOE has the most elaborate rules governing environmental reviews produced by project applicants; DOD’s are sketchy; DOT punts the issue to its various sub-agencies.

DOE defines “mitigation” briefly in its definition section; DOD does not define it; DOT has an elaborate definition.

The DOE, DOD, and DOT emergency provisions were all different, with DOE’s being the vaguest, but none of them referenced national emergency declarations.

The differences between agencies may be random, or they may reflect different attitudes toward NEPA. Regardless, they could prove troublesome for the government. Project opponents may be able to score points in court by showing that other agencies would have done things differently. More importantly, the differences between rules will cause problems when two agencies have jurisdiction over the same project but different NEPA rules. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) new guidelines look quite different from DOE’s rules, which could cause problems. Congress provided a process for agency coordination, but the process assumes that the agencies have the same procedures.

Dubious Weight in Court

Before Trump’s executive order, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued regulations that agencies were required to follow. This led to uniformity across agencies, and the CEQ process was also more deliberative than the preemptory issuance of new regulations that we’re now seeing. One might have thought that it was also more consistent with the idea of the unitary executive.

Be that all as it may, the CEQ regulations had one more important characteristic: they received significant deference from the courts. By contrast, these new regulations will get no deference when courts are interpreting NEPA. Even in the Chevron era, courts did not defer to agency interpretations of statutes when multiple agencies were interpreting the same law.",https://cpr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/uploads/2025/07/road-construction.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:34:35.237825

This time it has been BMW’s turn, which, following complaints from the South Korean market, has been forced to acknowledge a fault in its electric cars. After its introduction in the EV market in 2013, encouraged by the good data reported by Tesla and with the intention of competing with them, they had not had to face a situation like this.

Apparently, a failure in the coding of an electric motor software, is causing the high voltage system to shut down, causing a loss of engine power. BMW has announced that it will contact affected customers, owners of i4, i5, i7 and iX models, before August 2055. Users will only have to download an OTA (over the air) update, and the problem will be fixed.

BMW

It is probably one of the most reputable automotive manufacturing brands in the world market. Founded by Karl App, Gustav Otto, Camillo Castiglioni and Franz Josef Pop in 1916, it is headquartered in Munich, Germany. It has subsidiary brands such as Mini, Rolls-Royce, BMWi and BMW Bank. The BMW name is associated with quality, efficiency, design, power, and high-end. Its way of working is exquisite, with rigor and professionalism, it is one of the best valued brands.

Betting on the EV market

BMW is one of the companies with the longest track record in the sector, and has offered a wide variety of models and designs throughout its career. That is why in 2011, after seeing the success experienced by Tesla with the launch of electric vehicles, it decided to jump into the pool. They could not afford to fall behind in innovation. In 2013 came its all-electric model, the BMW 1602 Elektro-Antrieb. Since then it has continued to produce 100% electric and hybrid models. It was with the i8, a hybrid sports car, that it experienced great market acceptance and success.

What happened to the well-reputed BMW?

Although reports reveal that the company was aware of this fault as far back as 2021, it was not until complaints from the South Korean market grew that it decided to take action. BMW has recalled more than 70,000 cars after finding the fault was occurring with its electric lineup. Given its reputation for quality, it is hard to believe that its engineers missed something, but they did. The problem was detected in the power line. A coding fault in an electric motor software was analyzed, which causes the high voltage system to shut down, resulting in a sudden loss of power to the motor.

Which models are being affected?

Several models have been affected by this electrical failure, some of them produced at BMW Group’s Spartanburg, South Carolina plant. Find out if your model is one of those affected:

2022-2024 i4.

2025 i4 eDrive35.

2025 i4 eDrive40.

2022-2024 iX.

2023-2024 i7.

2024 i5.

The company has proceeded to resolve this issue as quickly and efficiently as possible. It has announced that affected customers will be notified by August 2025. Although it is a major malfunction, the solution provided is very simple. Drivers will only have to download an OTA update.

How will this recall affect BMW?

The truth is that it has been a hard blow for the brand. If there is one thing BMW provides, it is security for its customers. Aspects such as quality, anticipation of inconveniences, anticipation of needs, and a practically perfect user experience are taken for granted. That is why its reaction has been immediate, preventing it from spreading to other models. That is why the impact will not be as strong as expected. Yes, there has been an inconvenience, but they have solved it at great speed and provided an easy and convenient solution for consumers.",https://www.lagradaonline.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/22.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 14:22:12.920863

You can claim a $10,000 tax credit that you can roll over for three years.
Is it first come, first serve that you have to file your taxes ASAP to be able to get that tax credit?
So you do have to front the money yourself to be able to get this tax credit on the tax credit program.","Louisiana homeowners can now get a $10,000 tax credit if they install a fortified roof on their home. Lawmakers passed, and Gov. Jeff Landry signed Act 404, which created the individual income tax credit. The law went into effect earlier this month.

Capitol Access Reporter Brooke Thorington spoke with state Sen. Kirk Talbot (R-River Ridge) River Ridge Republican Senator Kirk Talbot after his legislation was signed into law last week.

This report has been edited for length and clarity.

BROOKE: Tell me a little bit about your bill and what you're hoping it will do for the state.

KIRK: So, my bill offers a $10,000 tax credit if you put a fortified roof on your home and you qualify for that, and it works in conjunction with the fortified grant program, which is also for $10,000.

Usually, or every time we open up the grant process, it sells out within five minutes. And, you know, we've put about $20 million a year in that obviously if we had unlimited money we could fund it even more. So this is an opportunity if you have the money, do you wanna front the money and put the roof on yourself.

You can claim a $10,000 tax credit that you can roll over for three years. Now there's a $10 million cap on that, and that's something that hopefully will raise that cap even more next year. So it's not unlimited. So there is a chance that you might put that on and, and not get the credit.

But I can assure you the amount of money that you're going to save by putting that fortified roof on is worth it whether you get the grant or whether you get the tax credit.

We also increased the tax deduction–from $5,000 to $10,000–to put a fortified roof that does not have a cap. So at the very minimum, you'll get a tax deduction of $10,000.

BROOKE: So how does this tax credit work? Is it first come, first serve that you have to file your taxes ASAP to be able to get that tax credit?

KIRK: It will come first serve. The Department of Revenue we're working with to get all that taken care of but that's just the only fair way to do it, is to do it that way.

BROOKE: I know a lot of people have things come in late on their income taxes. Should they go ahead and file early and then possibly amend their state tax return?

KIRK: I would do that. You can always amend your tax return, but as long as you file it, you know, I would go ahead and file it as soon as possible. And look, even in myself with my business, a lot of times we file an extension. So, you know, sometimes that's unavoidable. But again, just putting that fortified roof on, you will get a discount from your insurance company, and various companies give various discounts. It all depends.

The key is what Commissioner Tim Temple always stresses is you've gotta shop around. You really should shop around every six months regardless. But you really need to shop around. You can go on his website, the department's website and it'll show you the list of the companies and what percentage discounts they give.

Sometimes those are in ranges, and that's all relative to your particular home. But it will give you an idea of what companies are offering, what discounts. So you do have to front the money yourself to be able to get this tax credit on the tax credit program. Yes, you'll have to front that money yourself.

BROOKE: And about the education of this. I know Gov. Jeff Landry talked about doing more education about fortified roofs. Are you going to be working with the Department of Revenue on educating tax auditors on how folks can file their taxes to make sure they get these credits and deductions?

KIRK: We are and a lot of legislators have town hall meetings across the state. A lot of them asked [Insurance Commissioner] Tim Temple to come and talk about the Fortified Roof program, which he's willing to do. And, he is all over the place. And he always talks about it. I talk about it whenever I can. It's on the Commissioner’s website.

I know he puts out bulletins. It's, you know, we, we really need to stress that as much as possible. And I think all the governmental entities involved are doing everything they can to pump that knowledge out as much as we can.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bd5fcd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x924+0+125/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2F35%2F5a4276c74cf58621d04b9c90175d%2Falabama-roof.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 11:12:38.890819

“Our investments in sustainability have set the groundwork for an ambitious vision to transform the future of Port Newark — setting unparalleled standards for efficiency, environmental responsibility and economic prosperity.” News item from Standard Solar","Standard Solar and Port Newark Container Terminal (PNCT) have completed a 7.2-MW solar project engineered to integrate with the operational complexity of an active marine terminal in Newark, New Jersey. The project delivers clean energy using rooftop and canopy systems without disrupting port activity.

Made in partnership with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city of Newark, the system was built over active truck lanes, rooftops and parking areas, using the available space while maintaining full operations throughout construction. It now supplies approximately half of PNCT’s annual power needs.

“Designing and installing a system of this scale within a fully operational, high-traffic container facility required custom engineering and constant coordination,” said C.J. Colavito, GM of integrated project teams, Standard Solar. “From elevated canopy structures to rooftop arrays, every component was designed to work around ongoing port activity without compromising safety or performance.”

Built across the 320-acre terminal, the installation also has the capacity to send excess power to the Newark grid, supporting local energy resilience and emissions reduction.

The project is comprised of 3.8 MW of elevated canopy-mounted arrays over active truck lanes; 3.4 MW of additional rooftop and parking canopy arrays; and real-time monitoring energy production and carbon savings

“This project showcases the ingenuity and adaptability of solar to thrive in even the most complex, space-constrained logistics environments,” said Rick Berube, COO of Standard Solar. “We’re proud to help PNCT lead the way toward a cleaner, more resilient port, benefiting not just terminal operations but the Newark community and region as a whole.”

The PNCT solar installation is part of a larger clean energy roadmap developed under a 2011 lease agreement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. PNCT has implemented a suite of complementary initiatives, including LED lighting upgrades, hybrid straddle carriers, energy-efficient electric cranes and propane-powered yard tractors, all aimed at reducing emissions and enhancing port efficiency.

“Working with our partners for a more sustainable Newark is an immense priority for my administration,” said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. “We are acting locally while thinking globally on this world-changing issue. Port Newark’s solar energy project will help make our city healthier for present and future generations. We must continue efforts that combine our local infrastructure with clean power generation, driving Newark Forward — building new jobs, increasing the air quality of our community, and doing our part to fight climate change.”

Standard Solar owns and will operate and maintain the system long-term, ensuring consistent clean energy production and measurable environmental impact for years to come.

“PNCT, Standard Solar and Mayor Baraka, working together with the Port Authority, have been relentless in partnering for responsible expansion of the port to meet the shipping needs of our growing regional and national economy, without sacrificing the health and well-being of our neighbors,” said Jim Pelliccio, president and CEO of PNCT. “Our investments in sustainability have set the groundwork for an ambitious vision to transform the future of Port Newark — setting unparalleled standards for efficiency, environmental responsibility and economic prosperity.”

During the hearing, Skor emphasized that strong Renewable Volume Obligation (RVOs) will play a key role in delivering on President Trump’s vision for U.S. energy dominance and rural prosperity.

“If finalized, these RVOs would unlock investments, create jobs, and support growth in rural America by expanding our country’s renewable fuel production and use,” said Skor. “By setting conventional biofuel blending volumes at 15 billion gallons for two years, this proposal will create the kind of certainty that spurs innovation and truly unleashes American energy dominance. This is the strongest RFS proposal we’ve ever seen, with the highest volumes ever, showing this administration’s commitment to American biofuel producers and the farmers that depend on them.”

Skor also urged EPA to make it clear that small refinery exemptions (SREs) will not be granted recklessly, and that any gallons lost to SREs will be made up in the market.

“Only with these pieces in place can this proposal truly deliver the game-changing impact the president wants it to have, and that the nation’s biofuel producers and rural communities are counting on,” she added.

CnEVPost reported that in May, XPeng debuted the Mona M03 Max, a tech-upgraded version of its top-selling electric sedan.

The original Mona M03 has led China's A-segment electric vehicle sales for eight consecutive months. The Max variant builds on the success with major system upgrades, including XPeng's Turing artificial intelligence-assisted driving — previously limited to its higher-end SUVs — and a cockpit that supports full voice interaction.

The model starts at around $16,590 and produces no tailpipe pollution. As an EV, it requires less routine maintenance than a gas-powered car.

XPeng offers over 50 colors for the Max, including new shades such as cyan and purple, which are aimed at younger drivers. That strategy seems effective. The company reports that about 90% of Mona M03 buyers are under the age of 35.

The Mona M03 Max's success arrives as China's EV sector is evolving rapidly, with technological improvements offering a longer range and enhanced safety for consumers. NIO's long-range EV can travel over 550 miles, and BYD's recent battery upgrades improve safety and lifespan in smaller models. China recently committed $850 million to new EV technologies — a move that signals long-term support for clean transportation.

For drivers thinking about making their next car an EV, installing solar panels can significantly cut charging costs. EnergySage lets drivers compare solar quotes from vetted local installers, with potential savings of up to $10,000.

XPeng Chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng highlighted the model's real-world performance on X, noting that the company put the Mona M03 Max ""through six tough vision-only tests — from heavy rain and thick fog to dark nights and low-lying obstacles.""

The result, he said, was ""calm, confident handling. Even when human eyes fall short, our AI stays sharp.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/XPeng-Mona-M03-Maximage-recgMgGpSybxBRGsp.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:41:06.665487

The project moved from groundbreaking to operation in less than seven months. This is VinFast’s second EV plant to go live and the fifth in its global production network.

VinFast EV Plant Highlights Growth Strategy

Deputy Prime Minister Nguyễn Chí Dũng and senior officials from the Party and Hà Tĩnh Province attended the inauguration ceremony.

Võ Trọng Hải, Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Chairman of the Hà Tĩnh Provincial People’s Committee, congratulated VinFast and recognized the facility’s impact.

The factory includes a body welding shop, painting shop, general assembly shop, logistics warehouse, and a quality control center. A 240,000-square-meter auxiliary cluster is also under construction, with more expansions in the pipeline.

Advanced Technology Supports Global Quality Standards

The VinFast EV plant incorporates advanced production technology from companies including ABB, Dürr, FANUC, and Siemens. These systems drive automated production lines that comply with international standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and IATF 16949.

In the initial phase, the plant will operate with a designed capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year and produce an average of 35 vehicles per hour. The plant will focus on compact EV models like the VF 3, Minio Green, and EC Van — for both domestic and international markets.

Economic Impact and Localization Goals

VinFast estimates the plant will initially create around 6,000 direct jobs, with a potential expansion to 15,000. The company said it expects the Hà Tĩnh site to attract auxiliary partners, helping to build a synchronized supply chain. This supports VinFast’s goal of reaching more than 80% localization in EV production by 2026.

“Once operational, the VinFast Ha Tinh factory will contribute to VinFast’s goal of producing 1 million vehicles per year to meet the increasing demand of domestic and foreign markets,” said Nguyen Viet Quang, Vingroup’s CEO.

VinFast reported strong results in the first five months of 2025. It became the top-selling auto brand in Vietnam with over 56,000 vehicles delivered.

Professor Rohit Bhagat, Director of Coventry University’s Research Centre for E-Mobility and Clean Growth (CECG), explains some of the challenges slowing EV adoption and how critical research is supporting the shift to low-carbon transport.

EV adoption is underway, but not at the speed we need

Out of the 42 million vehicles on UK roads, only 1.3 million are fully electric. Almost a fifth of new car registrations in 2024 were zero-emission vehicles, providing hope that EV adoption is on the rise.

However, given rising fuel costs, growing environmental awareness and public support for sustainability, many might have expected a faster switch.

While the UK has made progress, it is still lagging behind global leaders, such as China and the Scandinavian countries. Ambitious targets to phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2035 risk remaining as mere spoken words unless the government steps up with stronger incentives to encourage the public to make the transition.

What’s holding back uptake?

Range anxiety and access to charging remain key concerns, with many drivers uncertain about whether they can easily access a charger when needed, just like a petrol station.

Then there’s the recharge time – a quick fuel stop takes minutes, but charging an EV can take half an hour or more, since not all charging points offer fast speeds. Additionally, higher upfront costs continue to deter potential buyers.

We live in a society that moves at full speed, and with patience in short supply, long waits at charging points don’t fit into busy schedules. Although the UK now has more EV chargers than petrol stations, slow and inconvenient access is a continuous problem.

To bring us closer to EVs charging on the move, CECG’s Research Centre for Transport and Cities (FTC) is helping to develop technology that wirelessly charges electric vehicles as they pass over metal coils embedded in the road. Designed for buses, taxis, and delivery vans, this technology could enable vehicles to continue driving without lengthy charging stops, reducing emissions while reflecting the realities of urban transport, where every minute counts.

For many living in urban areas without driveways or garages, charging an EV at home can be a real difficulty. In Coventry, 47% of households lack off-street parking, which is why FTC is backing the Levelling Up Coventry’s EV Adoption Journey. As part of this, CECG is trialling a mobile charging unit that can be used at any location and developing tools to help city planners map where chargers are needed most.

Residual values

There is a good understanding of the second-hand values of conventional cars, allowing leasing and PCP to work effectively, based on years of understanding. As the battery represents up to 50% of the costs of an EV, the residual performance of the battery pack is directly linked to the residual value of the car.

Therefore, EVs typically have lower residual values as people need to be convinced that the battery will last. Additionally, insurance costs for EVs are higher because they are more likely to be written off in the event of an accident.

A mixed-technology approach

That said, we can’t narrow battery-powered EVs as the only option. Perhaps the greatest thing we’ve learned so far about technology is that what works today could be replaced tomorrow. Decarbonising transport at scale will require a mix of technologies, especially for freight, aviation and other high-demand sectors.

Every day, we keep an open mind and push the limits of what’s possible, because the journey to net zero won’t be solved by one single technology. The Clean Futures programme reflects this, as it funds and guides businesses in developing various types of green transport technologies. The programme is also exploring different energy pathways entirely – from trialling zero-emission electric freight vehicles across Europe to developing hydrogen propulsion for future aircraft with ZeroAvia.

Enticing EV adoption is what is needed now to move closer to our targets, but ultimately, the road to net zero isn’t about one technology winning out – it’s about building a transport system flexible enough to meet diverse needs, reducing emissions across all sectors and adapting quickly as new breakthroughs emerge.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2031702881.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:32:30.501248

Slate's website has already been updated to say ""Expected price: Mid-Twenties"" rather than ""Under $20,000"" as it did previously.
That would align with a hypothetical purchase price of around $27,000 or less, which would have been $19,500 with the EV tax credit.
With no new cars available under $20,000, pricing a new small truck, an EV no less, under that threshold would have been quite the feat.

One that has already come to light, courtesy of TechCrunch, is that the cancellation of the federal EV tax credit in September means the affordable Slate Truck will no longer be as affordable as everyone thought it would be.

While Slate has not released any exact pricing, it has claimed that its small, affordable, and highly modular electric truck would cost less than $20,000 after the $7,500 federal EV incentive. Now that this credit is going away, customers will be on the hook for the full purchase price, which hits the wallet even harder on a vehicle already priced so low. Slate's website has already been updated to say ""Expected price: Mid-Twenties"" rather than ""Under $20,000"" as it did previously. That would align with a hypothetical purchase price of around $27,000 or less, which would have been $19,500 with the EV tax credit.

With no new cars available under $20,000, pricing a new small truck, an EV no less, under that threshold would have been quite the feat. It certainly made for great marketing, encouraging more than 100,000 reservations. The cancellation of the EV tax credit, preventing this claim from coming true, is not Slate's fault. The blame falls squarely on the Trump Administration's misguided efforts to help the domestic auto industry, which will end up hurting it instead, particularly EV manufacturers other than Tesla.

Even assuming a higher base purchase price somewhere around $27,000 without the tax credit, that's still less than the most basic versions of the Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz, both of which cost more than $30,000 after destination charges. Slate's website claim that ""Great cars got too pricey, we fixed that"" is still valid in theory. Besides, most customers won't buy the most basic, bare-bones truck anyway. They plan to spend a bit more and take advantage of Slate's extensive customization options, up to and including turning it into an SUV. So don't count Slate out just yet. The truck may not be quite as affordable as we'd hoped, but it's still less expensive than anything else around, so we're cautiously optimistic.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-slate-truck-wont-get-any-cheaper-now-that-trump-killed-ev-incentives/l-intro-1751923228.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:36:34.066170

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, at the direction of President Donald Trump, will file a notice this week to amend its resource management plans for the region to reopen federal coal leasing — just six months after the Biden leasing ban was finalized.
In justifying the lease ban, the Biden BLM noted that it did not apply to existing leases, which still include enough Powder River Basin coal reserves to maintain current production levels until about 2040, it said.
Aside from the stark swing in coal politics from Biden to Trump, speculation has been mounting over the past year about whether skyrocketing demand for electricity might entice Powder River Basin coal producers to finally nominate new major leases.
Though the industry is still shedding hundreds of jobs, output increased slightly during the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to Wyoming Public Radio.","Federal officials are undoing a Biden-era rule that ended new coal leasing in the prolific Powder River Basin spanning northeast Wyoming and southern Montana.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, at the direction of President Donald Trump, will file a notice this week to amend its resource management plans for the region to reopen federal coal leasing — just six months after the Biden leasing ban was finalized. The public will have 30 days to review and comment on the proposed action, setting a deadline of Aug. 7.

The agency on Monday reiterated the action complies with multiple Trump executive orders, including Unleashing American Energy and Declaring a National Energy Emergency.

“The BLM does not intend to hold any public meetings, in-person or virtual, during the public scoping period,” according to a preliminary notice published Monday in the Federal Registry.

What does it mean?

Though the BLM’s Buffalo and Miles City, Montana field offices had identified vast areas in the region it would consider for new leasing, coal companies here hadn’t nominated a major new coal lease in more than 10 years, which, in part, prompted the agency under Biden to initiate ending the leasing program, officials said at the time.

In justifying the lease ban, the Biden BLM noted that it did not apply to existing leases, which still include enough Powder River Basin coal reserves to maintain current production levels until about 2040, it said.

Aside from the stark swing in coal politics from Biden to Trump, speculation has been mounting over the past year about whether skyrocketing demand for electricity might entice Powder River Basin coal producers to finally nominate new major leases. That hasn’t been the case, so far. But both Congress and the Wyoming Legislature have been trying to further entice them.

Wyoming lawmakers earlier this year passed House Bill 75, “Coal severance tax rate,” which reduces the severance tax for surface-mined coal from 6.5% to 6%. The congressional budget reconciliation bill — One Big Beautiful Bill Act — signed into law Friday, reduces the federal royalty rate on coal from 12.5% to 7% through 2034, which will make “the coal royalty structure more representative of today’s market and mining conditions and helps get the industry closer to a level playing field among energy commodities,” the Wyoming Energy Authority said in a statement.

Those tax reductions, along with a slew of Trump administration measures to slash regulations on both the coal-mining and coal-burning sides of the equation are intended to finally make good on Trump’s promise during his first administration to revitalize the industry.

Critics have referred to the Trump and congressional actions as the “biggest coal giveaway in history.”

“Just last year, the Bureau of Land Management found it impossible to justify continued coal leasing in the Powder River Basin considering the abundant coal already under lease, shrinking demand, and the imperative to phase out fossil fuel development to address the climate crisis,” Earthjustice Northern Rockies Managing Attorney Jenny Harbine said in a prepared statement Monday. “The administration’s efforts to expand coal mining on our public lands are no more justified now and will sell out our communities to further enrich coal industry executives.”

Coal production in Wyoming, the largest supplier in the nation, has declined by nearly half since its peak in 2008. Though the industry is still shedding hundreds of jobs, output increased slightly during the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to Wyoming Public Radio.

The discussion is part of the European Commission's efforts to broker a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump and would replace the hefty 25% tariff on car and car part imports the U.S. administration implemented in April.

This would be a clear positive for those carmakers with major U.S. production facilities, who would be able to use their U.S. production to lower their exposure to tariffs.

This is what a trade deal means for the EU and how individual European automakers would be affected:

WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR EU?

According to data from European auto association ACEA, nearly 758,000 cars worth 38.9 billion euros ($45.55 billion) were exported to the U.S. from Europe in 2024, more than four times as many as in the other direction.

One EU diplomat said cars were a ""red line"" for the bloc, making a concession on cars a caveat of any deal. However, Brussels and Washington have conflicting goals as Trump wants to revive U.S. auto production while Brussels wants open markets for its sector, which is struggling with high energy costs and competition from China.

WHO STANDS TO WIN?

Germany's BMW and Mercedes-Benz would benefit most from a mechanism counting U.S. exports against imports from the EU, as both companies operate large factories in the United States.

BMW, for example, exported around 225,000 vehicles produced at its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant in 2024, while it sold around 400,000 autos in the U.S. market. It imported around 175,000 autos from other markets, less than what it exported.

Mercedes-Benz exports around two thirds of the vehicles it makes at its plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, or around 170,000 based on 2024 production.

It sold around 324,528 vehicles in the United States last year and imported around 235,000 from other countries.

WHO WOULD BE THE LOSERS?

Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, would not benefit, as it mostly sells cars produced at its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant locally rather than exporting them.

An industry source said for that reason, there has also been a push to get Washington to agree to investment credits, which would support foreign automakers' plans to expand to boost local production.

Volkswagen, for example, is currently deciding whether to localise production of its Audi brand - which imports all of its cars into the U.S. market - either via a new factory or expanding existing sites.

Porsche would also see no benefit: it has no local production and imports all of its cars from Europe.

LITTLE IMPACT FOR STELLANTIS

Stellantis, the world's No. 4 automaker, owner of brands including Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, would not be seriously affected by such an arrangement.

Stellantis operates a number of U.S. plants, mostly serving the local market, while import and export flows of its cars between the U.S. and the European Union have historically been very low - typically small volumes of U.S.-made trucks versus European-made models from the Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Fiat brands.

The group is far more vulnerable to any U.S. tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as it manufactures around 40% of its North American vehicles in those two countries, particularly in Mexico.

CLEAR LOSS FOR VOLVO CARS

Volvo Cars is one of the most exposed European automakers to U.S. tariffs, as most of the cars it sells there are imported from Europe. The U.S. accounted for 16% of group sales last year.

The company has said it will expand production at its Charleston, South Carolina factory, adding a new model alongside the electric EX90 that is currently made there.

Volvo has said the new vehicle would most likely be a plug-in hybrid mid-sized SUV, a popular option with U.S. consumers.

Last year Polestar, which like Volvo Cars is part of China's Geely group, started producing the Polestar 3 SUV at the Charleston plant to avoid hefty U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made cars.

Xtra Energy Corp. (OTC Pink:XTPT) is pleased to announce that road construction has officially begun at its American Antimony Project in Nevada. This milestone follows the successful posting and formal acceptance of the Company's reclamation bond by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM)-the final regulatory requirement prior to ground activity.

Construction crews are now fully mobilized on-site, and initial roadwork is progressing on schedule. Completion is expected within the next week, allowing XTPT to immediately launch its Phase 1 drill program and begin detailed sampling and assessment of over 22 historic high-grade surface stockpiles.

""We're now in motion,"" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO of XTPT. ""This development signals the beginning of a transformative phase for the Company. Our team has positioned itself to execute quickly, and with roadwork nearing completion, we're set to open access to both subsurface drill targets and surface stockpiles that could generate early revenue.""

Project Highlights:

22+ historic surface stockpiles identified across the site, created during WWI and WWII

Sampling from initial piles has returned grades up to 33% Sb, with an average of 12.8%

First 2,100 tons of material targeted for metallurgical testing and potential near-term sale

Drilling to test extensions of high-grade stibnite veins and felsite dikes along a 4-kilometer corridor

The American Antimony Project is one of the only known U.S.-based projects with the potential to deliver domestic antimony production-a material vital for munitions, semiconductors, and grid-scale energy storage.

Strategic Timing Amid Geopolitical Shifts

The Company's development efforts come at a time of renewed urgency for domestic defense supply chains. With the Pentagon now halting certain munitions exports due to low U.S. stockpiles, the need for a reliable domestic source of antimony has become more critical than ever.

XTPT is on track to not only advance exploration but to play a key role in restoring American antimony production capacity for the first time in decades.

“This is not a one-off anymore,” said Claudia Benitez-Nelson, a climate scientist at the University of South Carolina.
Extreme rainfall events are increasing across the U.S. as temperatures rise, she said.
He concluded in a report last year that extreme rain in Texas could increase 10 percent by 2036.
“We are in a more extreme climate,” Faranda said.","Heavy rains over the weekend that pushed the Guadalupe River in Texas’ Hill Country to its second-highest height on record had by Tuesday resulted in more than 100 reported deaths, including 27 children and counselors from Camp Mystic.

Climate scientists said the torrential downpours on July 4 exemplify the devastating outcomes of weather intensified by a warming atmosphere. These disasters, they said, will become more frequent as people around the world continue to burn fossil fuels and heat the planet.

Warmer temperatures allow for the atmosphere to hold more water vapor, producing heavier rainfalls, she and other climate scientists said. This coupled with old infrastructure and ineffective warning systems can be disastrous.

“It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in particular for temperature extremes,” the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2021. “At the global scale, the intensification of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold as it warms about 7% per 1°C of global warming.”

The U.S. government’s fifth National Climate Assessment, released in November 2023, says that “the number of days with extreme precipitation will continue to increase as the climate warms” and that “these changes in precipitation patterns can lead to increased flood hazards, impacting infrastructure, ecosystems, and communities.”

Central Texas is infamous for its flash flooding and arid soil, hard-packed ground into which water does not easily infiltrate. So when rain hits the ground, it runs off the region’s hilly terrain and canyons and accumulates into creeks and rivers rapidly, overwhelming them, causing them to rise quickly.

The flash flooding wasn’t a result of a full-strength storm, Benitez-Nelson said, but a remnant of a tropical storm. “That, to me, is really sad and deeply alarming,” Benitez-Nelson said. “Climate change is turning ordinary weather into these disasters.”

Damp remnants of Tropical Storm Barry moved up from eastern Mexico as humid air also moved north from Mexico’s southwestern coast, stalling over Texas’ Hill Country. The warm air in both the low and high levels of the atmosphere is a recipe for intense rainfall, said John Nielsen-Gammon, the state’s appointed climatologist for more than 20 years.

He and his colleagues compiled a list of all the rainfall events in Texas that produced more than 20 inches of rain a few years ago. One common feature the climatologists found was when wind blew from south to north, or when moisture was brought northward from the tropics, he said. “That sets up the possibility of very heavy rainfall,” Nielsen-Gammon said. He concluded in a report last year that extreme rain in Texas could increase 10 percent by 2036.

Increased moisture from the tropics is driven by warming oceans.

The oceans absorb over 90 percent of excess heat in the atmosphere produced by greenhouse gas emissions, warming ocean temperatures down to depths of 2,000 meters. Tropical storms gain strength from heat and evaporate more quickly at higher temperatures, adding more water vapor to the atmosphere, Nielsen-Gammon said.

A study released Monday by ClimaMeter, a project funded by the European Union and the French National Center for Scientific Research, found that meteorological conditions leading up to Friday morning’s floods were warmer and 7 percent wetter than similar events of the past. Natural variability alone can’t explain the changes in rain associated with the exceptional weather, the report said, and points to human-caused climate change as one of the main drivers of the event.

ClimaMeter’s analysis shows the difference in surface temperature, precipitation and wind speed between the present climate from 1987 and earlier decades, from 1950 to 1986.

“Climate change loads the dice toward more frequent and more intense floods,” said Davide Faranda, one of the report’s authors who is research director of climate physics in the Laboratoire de Science du Climat et de l’Environnement, part of the French National Center for Scientific Research. “The flash flood that tore through Camp Mystic at night, when people were most vulnerable, shows the deadly cost of underestimating this shift.”

He added: “A 7 percent increase of rain is a lot, but doesn’t really make the tragedy. If you have a good alert system, if the population knows the risk related to climate change for this weather phenomena and can take them into account, not minimize them, then you can save lives, because it’s not double the amount of precipitation, it’s not three times. It’s something that we can handle if we are prepared.”

Other factors in the flooding death toll such as land use change, urban sprawl and warning system failures weren’t analyzed and may have further amplified the disaster, the report said.

“We are in a more extreme climate,” Faranda said. “And every year, year after year, we make it more extreme by burning more fossil fuels. … These extremes now start to touch the limits of what is normal life on this planet, in terms of humans, in terms of infrastructure that we built with the old climate, in terms of resilience of the ecosystem.”

Initial estimates for the damage and economic loss of this disaster will reach beyond $18 billion, according to AccuWeather.

The combined entity, operating under United Energy LNG (UE LNG), immediately oversees a portfolio of three LNG production sites in advanced stages of development. UE LNG is announcing the commencement of front-end loading Phase 1 (FEL-1) at its first project site in Houston, Texas, with a second confidential site underway. A third site in Independence, Kansas, is scheduled to begin FEL-1 later in July. With geographic diversity and early-stage capacity, UE LNG aims to expand LNG access for high-demand domestic users.

“While the majors are focused on megaprojects, we’re deploying modular, nimble solutions that get LNG to the people and industries who need it now,” said Brian Guinn, CEO of United Energy LNG.

Despite global LNG investment nearing US$200 billion annually, small-scale LNG remains the least crowded, most overlooked frontier in US energy. Major players focus on export, while decentralised markets remain stranded. That gap is UE LNG’s advantage.

“This merger represents the alignment of speed, innovation, and execution,” added Austin Terry, CEO of Power LNG. “By combining our development and operational expertise with United Energy’s capital platform, we’re unlocking a scalable model for delivering LNG where it’s needed most.”

The merger combines United Energy’s upstream operating experience and public market presence with Power LNG’s permitting progress, engineering capabilities, and pipeline of modular projects. Key metrics include:

3 Active Development Sites across Texas, Kansas, and the Gulf Coast.

Targeted Liquefaction Capacity of up to 540 000 million tpy at full deployment.

Estimated Capital Investment: US$24 – US$270 million across three facilities.

Cash flow projections targeting breakeven within 12 – 18 months post-commissioning.

Engineering, procurement, and strategic project management partnerships.

Public market access via United Energy LNG’s parent company.

United Energy LNG plans to reach financial close on its first three facilities by 1Q26, with commissioning expected by 1Q27. The company is actively engaging with feedgas suppliers, utilities, and logistics providers to build out a nationwide virtual LNG delivery network.

The company estimates that its addressable domestic market exceeds 2 billion ft3 equivalent annually, representing a US$3+ billion opportunity in underserved power, transport, and industrial sectors.

“This is just the beginning,” concluded Guinn. “By 2028, we aim to operate a network of scalable LNG hubs serving a portfolio of contracted customers across the US, turning America’s natural gas into clean, distributed power for everyone.”",https://d11onib03523a2.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/US-full-map-02.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:38:56.570054

This is reflected in the variety of state actions to accommodate load growth,” the report said.

The key drivers of load growth include data centers, manufacturing and electrification, CESA said.

A big challenge facing states is uncertainty around load forecast projections, the report pointed out.

The future of artificial intelligence and crypto mining, changes in state policy around electrification and clean energy, and the impact of federal policies on domestic industry and manufacturing all contribute to uncertainty.

“Additionally, big data centers often scout multiple potential locations for potential development, thereby making it unclear to state regulators and utility planners if and where a particular data center will ultimately be built.”

Prior to the recent sharp increase in the rate of load growth, states used a range of supply-side strategies to accommodate business-as-usual load growth, including investments in low-cost renewables, storage, and some natural gas capacity alongside energy efficiency and demand-side programs, CESA said.

“Now faced with precipitous load growth, states are employing various strategies to meet the challenge.”

Most states -- especially those with strong clean energy/climate targets -- are continuing their existing renewable energy, efficiency, and demand response strategies.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-08 10:12:44.025111

Words Dr Frank Millard

Just a few years ago, the US EV industry seemed poised for unprecedented growth, bolstered by ambitious policies, record investments, and a global race to electrify transportation. But with a new administration rolling back climate regulations and revising EV policies, the industry finds itself navigating uncertainty once again.

The shift has drawn sharp reactions from industry leaders, economists, and environmental advocates alike. While some warn of a looming crisis, others see an opportunity for recalibration, innovation, and ultimately, resilience.

With a flurry of executive orders, the Trump administration has reversed or revised several key EV and climate policies. One of the most significant moves was the repeal of the Biden-era target for EVs to make up 50% of new car sales by 2030. The administration also sought to strip California of its ability to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035, a decision that could reverberate across the 12 states following its stricter emissions rules.

This has sent shockwaves through an industry that has poured billions into an electric future. “It is unfortunate that such an important technology has become a political third rail because EVs represent the future of the automotive industry and are therefore critical to America’s economic well-being,” says Professor J. Higham at EVA. “EVs are the future not simply because they are ‘green.’ Indeed, being better for the planet can be viewed as a happy coincidence. EVs are the future of the automotive industry because they offer a better driving experience at a lower overall cost to the user.

“China understands this and has staked their economic future on being world leaders in EV technology. The United States cannot yield its dominance in auto manufacturing to win a few political points.” The Executive Order reversing the ‘EV mandate’ is symbolic, adds Higham, because there is no policy or law officially known by that name. “So, in some sense, the EO is a political move akin to throwing red meat to his supporters and little else,” he says.

Quentin Willson, founder of FairCharge, warns that these policy reversals could isolate the US auto industry from global megatrends. “Protectionism doesn’t work when such a technological shift is happening across China and Europe,” he cautions. “US cars and trucks are currently too expensive with dated tech and operating systems. Believing that protecting yesterday’s technology will stop a powertrain transition that is happening across the world is like trying to draw up laws against the sea.”

Self-inflicted setback

Beyond politics, these changes pose a direct threat to the economic competitiveness of US automakers. Professor Daniel Sperling, founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis, draws a stark comparison to past industry missteps:

“The US auto industry has been atrophying since the 1970s when the Japanese exploited the poor quality, high cost, high emissions, and gas-guzzling vehicles of that time,” he says. “Detroit’s Big Three – General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler – fought back and retained competitiveness, but then they gradually ceded the car market to others, increasingly focusing on SUVs and pickups.”

By pulling back on EV incentives and regulations, he warns, the US is repeating history. “What will be left: a further atrophied business founded on large SUVs and pickup trucks that the rest of the world has minimal interest in – and even worse – is not well suited to electrification due to their massive, expensive batteries. This is a disaster in the making – gutting our industrial base, creating a self-inflicted economic, national security, and jobs disaster.”`

The numbers underscore the risks. China, now the dominant force in EV manufacturing, exported a record $15 billion in vehicles in 2023. Meanwhile, US automakers face growing pressure to keep pace. “By revoking the 2021 EV targets, the US risks ceding global leadership in electrified transport to China,” warns Ginny Buckley, Managing Director of Electrifying.com. “The US must stay ahead by building the cars the world demands – or risk being left behind.”

Asian supremacy

This is echoed by Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association (EDTA), who warns that an abrupt change of policies reinforcing investment in electric transportation and resilient supply chains will create uncertainty throughout the value chain and reduce consumer options: “The vacuum left by US policy leadership will be filled by countries like China that are committed to owning the global market for transportation technologies,” she says.

Indeed, China’s growing influence looms large over the EV conversation. Beyond its lead in vehicle production, China dominates the critical mineral supply chain, refining between 35% and 70% of key materials needed for EV batteries. Yet Sperling argues that the economic ties between the US and China make a full decoupling unrealistic. “The US economy is completely interwoven with China. This is not like Russia, where the Russian economy is relatively isolated,” he says.

Ian Beavis, Chief Strategy Officer at AMCI Global, acknowledges China’s cost advantages but points out structural differences. “Yes, they’ve got lower costs, but a large part of that is in the way they are more vertically integrated,” he explains. Recognizing these challenges, some see the policy reversals as an opportunity to strengthen domestic supply chains. Andy Leyland, MD and Co-Founder of SC Insights, suggests that a renewed focus on US-based mineral extraction could ultimately bolster the EV industry. , “A renewed focus on industry and consumer choice, rather than mandates, will ultimately lead to a more robust domestic supply chain – even if this does take longer to develop than a quicker import heavy model,” he says.

Leyland points out that the Unleashing American Energy executive order has a notable focus on critical minerals alongside fossil fuels, which should give “additional urgency, and therefore support, to the development of domestic extraction and processing,” he says.

Industry resilience

Despite the political turbulence, industry leaders remain confident that electrification is here to stay. “The only certainty is uncertainty,” says Beavis. “But unlike the first Trump administration where there was a sense of panic, there isn’t a sense of panic this time. There’s more of an ‘OK, we sort of know what we’re getting.’” Automakers have adapted their strategies, maintaining their commitment to EVs while hedging their bets on profitable short-term technologies. “The industry now is nimbler than it’s ever been,” Beavis notes. “They hate whipsaw change, but they’re focusing on core business and profitable near-term technologies while developing deeper relationships with tech companies and tier-one suppliers.” Cullen sees an opportunity in integrating transportation with the power grid. “The national effort to modernize the grid is an opportunity to integrate the transportation and power sectors. This large-scale shift is necessary to meet the evolving needs of both,” she says. California remains a stronghold for EV policy, with its zero-emission vehicle regulations influencing a third of the US auto market. However, Sperling notes that uneven adoption across states poses challenges for automakers. “California is making a strong commitment. But the industry’s fear is that many of these other states are not making the same commitment, and they’re going to be held out to dry and face a lot of fines.” Beyond policy, market forces will shape the future of EVs. Higham points out a key dynamic: “We keep talking about companies just selling to what the market wants. It’s selling to what a small percentage of the market wants.” Wealthier, multi-car households make up just 16% of households but account for over 50% of new vehicle sales. This trickle-down effect means the used EV market, which will eventually make EVs more accessible, remains years away from maturity.

Change is but inevitable

As the industry braces for potential tariffs and regulatory battles, the question remains: Can the US maintain its foothold in the global EV race?

Cullen remains optimistic. “Despite policy changes, the future remains electric – that trajectory is unchanged. In the US, there are over six million plug-in and fuel cell vehicles on the road. Market share was over 10% of light-duty vehicle sales in January. Hybrid sales also continue to increase, with over 40% growth in January 2025 compared with January 2024.”

Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) predicts that by 2030, EVs will make up 45% of global passenger-vehicle sales. Whether the US leads or lags in this transition depends on the strategies shaping the next few years.

“Policies that undermine certainty or diminish the synergy between supply and demand incentives can slow the US market in the near term,” says Cullen. “In the long term, the market continues but US leadership is less clear.”

Higham urges EV advocates to stay vigilant. “It is time for EV advocates to circle their wagons and remind all lawmakers that there is nothing as constant as change.

About Beta Technologies

Beta Technologies is an electric aircraft startup specializing in both vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) and conventional takeoff & landing (CTOL) vehicles.

It was founded in 2017 by engineer/pilot/entrepreneur Kyle Clark, who was inspired to create electric aircraft after learning to fly helicopters and recognizing the need for efficient long-distance transport of critical cargo like organs.

The company started with a prototype and rapidly advanced by collaborating with the U.S. Air Force and United Therapeutics.

Beta’s main products include the ALIA A250, designed for short trips, and the ALIA CX300, a conventional takeoff model focused on quicker certification and commercial use.

Both aircraft types are supported by the Beta Technologies charging infrastructure network, built to enable rapid and reliable power delivery across North America.

Headquartered in South Burlington, Vermont, the company also operates facilities in New York, North Carolina, Montreal, and Washington, DC.

Beta Technologies is set to be a competitive leader in electric aviation in cargo, defense, and passenger transport, backed by solid partnerships, successful test flights, and upcoming aircraft deliveries.

Here’s a look at the aircraft:

Ownership

Beta Technologies is a venture-backed startup. Equity owners include founders, employees, and venture capital firms.

The company has raised more than $1.3 billion in equity and debt financing since 2017. The latest confirmed funding round, which took place in October 2024, raised $318 million.

Investors include United Therapeutics, Fidelity, TPG (The Rise Fund), Qatar Investment Authority, and Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund.

Valuation

The last confirmed Beta Technologies valuation is about $3.8 billion based on the October 2024 Series C funding round.

IPO Potential

The Beta Technologies IPO date is unknown and unlikely to occur in the next few years. However, we have seen other eVOTL companies go public.

The best practice is to raise private funds and generate predictable revenue before an IPO.

The company’s primary technology still needs to be tested and refined before accelerating manufacturing and delivering aircraft at scale.

If private funding dries up before the company is IPO-ready, it could choose to SPAC into the private markets. However, SPAC debuts have been met with ill-reception over the past five years.

An IPO remains the best option for companies aspiring to go public.

How to Invest in Beta Technologies Stock

Since Beta Technologies is a private company, becoming an equity owner today is challenging, especially before the company establishes its revenue.

Investors can take action to own shares indirectly or improve their chances of early equity ownership and future IPO access.

Here are some possible ways to acquire shares before and after an IPO.

1. Access shares on pre-IPO investing platforms

The author has seen limited availability of Beta Technologies stock availability on pre-IPO investing platforms. Its primary investors are invested for the long term, and we’ve seen very few opportunities to acquire shares.

Employees looking for liquidity may be restricted from selling in these early stages.

Shares may become available when early investors or employees want to cash out before an IPO.

Opportunities may become more likely if the company raises additional rounds of venture capital, which could make headlines if the company’s technology continues to achieve its objectives.

Accredited investors can monitor pre-IPO investing platforms such as Hiive, Equitybee, Forge Global, and EquityZen for Beta Technologies stock availability.

Check out our list of top pre-IPO investing platforms for current share availability.

Investment minimums range from $5,000 to $100,000 on these platforms. Signing up for online access to pre-IPO data and deal alerts is free.

Non-accredited retail investors can invest in pre-IPO companies by owning the Fundrise Innovation Fund (review).

However, you cannot select individual pre-IPO companies, and Beta Technologies stock is not in the portfolio at this time.

2. Invest Indirectly

United Therapeutics (UTHR) is an early investor in Beta Technologies.

Though its investment stake has not been publicly disclosed, retail investors can buy United Therapeutics stock to gain exposure to Beta Technologies.

Investors can open an account with TradeStation or another commission-free online broker to buy shares.

3. Participate in the Beta Technologies IPO

When the time comes, there are ways to position yourself to be able to participate in IPOs to help meet your investment objectives.

But it takes some upfront homework.

IPO access has become more attainable to retail investors in the past few years.

The following online brokers give customers free access to IPOs, even with low account balances:

TradeStation

Robinhood

Access to specific high-demand IPOs is limited by the brokerage accounts you have and the broker who gets exclusive access.

TradeStation has a longer track record of accessing more than 400 IPOs and secondary offerings via its partnership with Click Markets.

But Robinhood has the advantage of Silicon Valley networks and a history of getting allocations for high-profile IPOs.

Check out this list of the best brokers for IPO investing to learn more about IPO access for retail investors.

4. Buy the stock after the IPO

Waiting for the IPO requires patience. Beta Technologies’ IPO may never happen or be more than a decade away.

Therefore, pre-IPO investing may be the best path for investors eager to own the potential of fusion energy. Beta Technologies has been available to accredited retail investors on multiple pre-IPO investing platforms.

But there are advantages to waiting until after the IPO before owning stocks.

Stock price declines after IPOs can be excellent entry points. But in this case, Beta Technologies may never be a viable company. Pre-IPO investing requires significant risk.

Where is the Beta Technologies IPO S-1 Filing?

Beta Technologies will not likely start the IPO process in the next few years. So you will not find an S-1 SEC filing.

When the company makes progress with its technology and is capable of generating revenue, it may choose the public route.

If Beta Technologies ever submits an S-1 filing and releases it to the public, we’ll post it here.

In the meantime, you can check out the most recent S-1 filings in our S-1 filings feed.

Conclusion

Beta Technologies is laying the groundwork for clean, efficient, regional transportation.

With its dual focus on eVTOL and CTOL aircraft paired with its charging infrastructure, the company is building a scalable transportation ecosystem.

This approach could position Beta as a dominant player once regulatory hurdles clear and commercial operations begin.

Though retail investors have limited early ownership options, the company’s close ties to institutional partners like United Therapeutics, Fidelity, and Amazon’s Climate Pledge suggest deep-pocketed backers are in for the long haul.

Beta’s leadership has not indicated its commitment to an eventual public offering. Instead, statements have focused on technology milestones and growth. That’s to be expected at this stage.

Investors should be cautious if the company hurries into the public markets via a SPAC. This would indicate private money has dried up, suggesting a flaw in the long-term business model.

If successful, the company could become a blueprint for how to grow a capital-intensive, hardware-focused clean-tech startup responsibly. For interested investors, it’s a long game.

Clinton plant’s rough start When the Clinton plant opened in 1987, it was seven years late and 10 times over budget.
In a recent study, the Illinois Power Agency projected continued steep increases in capacity prices for the next quarter century.","As Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg expands his ravenous data centers, he’s agreed to take over subsidies that Illinois ratepayers have been providing to a nuclear power station in central Illinois since 2017. The move could be the first step in a Silicon Valley bailout of nuclear power stations that supply half the electricity generated in Illinois.

Last month, Zuckerberg announced a 20-year stipend for a Constellation Energy nuclear plant in Clinton, a rural community 25 miles south of Bloomington. He’s helping to plan a second and perhaps even a third reactor for the site and may help foot the bill.

Constellation views its agreement with Zuckerberg as a potential template for four other Illinois nuclear plants where ratepayer subsidies are also set to expire in 2027, said Mason Emnett, Constellation’s senior vice president for public policy.

The biggest nuclear provider in the United States, Constellation owns all six Illinois nuclear plants and has close ties with other artificial intelligence giants. This includes Microsoft, with which Constellation agreed last year to restart a nuclear reactor at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania.

By pouring money into nuclear, Zuckerberg and his fellow artificial intelligence billionaires are marking the start of a new epoch in Illinois energy policy.

They stand at the forefront in deciding which power plants Illinois will keep open, expand or build. But they’re launching new data centers faster than power plants in a state already facing electricity shortages and higher prices as coal and gas plants are closed to clean the air.

“The data centers are getting so big, they’re threatening the ability of power grids to supply enough power,” said Bob Johnson, a research analyst at Gartner in Portland, Oregon.

“You either have to pass the extra cost to all the other users, or you allow somebody like Zuckerberg to cover it,” he said. “Then you still have to ask, ‘How are we going get power for everybody else?'”

When Zuckerberg announced June 3 that he’s taking over ratepayer subsidies scheduled to end in 2027 for Clinton, he did not buy electricity itself. He also did not pay to reserve some of the plant’s future generating capacity.

Rather, he purchased Clinton’s clean energy “attributes.’’ This is an accounting term that means his Meta Platforms, Inc. will have the exclusive right to use the plant’s carbon-free electricity to offset the fossil fuel he’s burning elsewhere in his empire.

Zuckerberg is spending heavily for these “attributes” because he’s pledged to offset all his fossil fuel use with renewable and clean power by 2030.

The ultimate impact on other Illinois ratepayers will depend on how rapidly Zuckerberg actually builds both data centers and power plants in future years.

Urvi Parekh, head of global energy for Meta, wouldn’t detail the company’s future Illinois plans in an interview. But there’s no question they’re big.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is spending up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. That’s an increase from about $40 billion last year. The company is rushing partly to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s support for nuclear power. At Trump’s behest, Republicans are accelerating the phaseout of investment tax credits for wind and solar but retain them for fossil fuel and nuclear energy.

With a series of executive orders, the president has outlined plans to quadruple U.S. nuclear power output, streamline the licensing process and have 10 new reactors under construction by 2030.

Neither Meta nor Constellation would specify how much Zuckerberg will pay for Clinton’s “attributes.’’

Since 2017, according to the Illinois Power Agency, ratepayers have subsidized the Clinton plant to the tune of $777 million. If Zuckerberg spends at the same rate, he’ll pay about $2 billion over 20 years to Constellation.

Meta and Constellation are working together to evaluate a variety of reactor sizes and designs for a possible Clinton expansion, Emnett said. “The fact that we’re participating in a request-for-proposals to discuss the potential third reactor at a site which was moving toward shutdown in the past is very exciting within the nuclear industry,” Emnett said. “We’re just in a different spot, and we’re very proud to be working with Meta on that.”

Meta hopes to decide on its nuclear expansion plans at Clinton and elsewhere by the end of the year, Parekh said.

Meta has plenty of options because, at the end of March, the company had $70.2 billion in cash and marketable securities on hand.

With Zuckerberg’s revenue stream in hand, Constellation can complete the relicensing of the Clinton plant and make the investments needed to continue operations for 20 years, Emnett said.

Constellation, meanwhile, is in talks with a variety of customers and data center developers about future possibilities at its other Illinois plants, Emnett said.

Constellation was spun off in 2022 by Exelon, which runs major electricity grids in Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Exelon distributes the power Constellation’s plants create. Commonwealth Edison, the biggest electric utility in Illinois, is a subsidiary of Exelon.

Zuckerberg’s Clinton announcement came three days after the Illinois legislature balked at, among other things, forcing data centers and other businesses to “bring their own” renewable power as they grow or pay higher electricity rates.

Constellation, its labor allies and a trade group that includes Meta all opposed the measure.

It’s an increasingly widespread debate. Data center power demand will double in the U.S. by 2030 and account for nearly 9% of the country’s total electricity use by 2035, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

The research group lists northern Illinois as a data center hotspot.

Mark Denzler, president of the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association, said the bill would have significantly boosted costs and construction times not just for data centers but also for schools, hospitals and factories.

“The states that are going to win are the states that are leading on energy and workforce and how quickly you can get a shovel in the ground,” Denzler said.

Clinton plant’s rough start

When the Clinton plant opened in 1987, it was seven years late and 10 times over budget. Endless factory closings in nearby towns such as Decatur had long since undermined the business case for a second reactor. A decade after the plant opened, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shut it back down for 2½ years after a recirculating pump failed and dumped 7,000 gallons of radioactive water into the reactor building.

Today, decades after this notorious shutdown and decades after Constellation’s predecessor Exelon bought the plant and upgraded its training and equipment, being a one-reactor power station still hinders Clinton. “This means less electricity to sell to cover the costs of running the plant,’’ Emnett said.

The plant’s operators are reminded of this problem every day.

As they walk through the glass-enclosed bridge that connects their administrative offices to the plant, they can look down to the left or right and see rusty rebar and high-pressure pipes installed decades ago for the second reactor.

Inside, the plant feels like the fortress that it is, with razor wire, gun-toting guards and endless security stations that monitor the identities and radiation exposures of people coming and going.

In the control room on a 95-degree Monday, the high temperature of the surrounding 5,000-acre cooling lake forced operators to dial back the reactor.

Every five weeks, control room operators report for a week of training that includes computer simulations of all conceivable reactor malfunctions, said Andy Krukowski, plant manager. It’s the kind of intense, career-long training found in just a handful of professions, including airline pilots and astronauts, he said.

In the yard outside, just a few feet away from the reactor, spent fuel rods encased in steel-and-concrete storage casks languish for eternities as they cool down enough for safe disposal.

Workers will install another set of fuel rods this fall during a long-planned, 20-day shutdown when the plant will stop producing electricity. The regular workforce of 532 will temporarily expand to include up to 3,000 skilled tradespeople from around the country. They’ll work not just on fuel rods but on all manner of maintenance chores and equipment upgrades, such as bigger pipes to pump more water through the turbines so the plant can make more electricity.

Clinton’s workers went through the same exercise in 2023. When this year’s shutdown arrives, they’re hoping to celebrate what the nuclear industry calls a “breaker-to-breaker run.’’ This means no unplanned outages between scheduled refueling stops.

It would be another milestone in the plant’s emergence as one of Constellation’s best operational performers, Krukowski said.

The plant is located east of downtown Clinton across 8 miles of corn and soybeans. A big wind farm hovers over the town and also supplies 125 megawatts of power to Meta.

On June 26, Meta agreed to buy another 791 megawatts of solar and wind energy for data centers in Ohio, Arkansas and Texas from Invenergy, which is based in Chicago.

Clinton has just 7,500 residents. They’ve given themselves over to nuclear power so totally that for years they sponsored “Glow in the Dark” regattas out at the cooling lake. They dubbed their local AM station “radio active.”

The plant is embedded in the lives of Mayor Helen Michelassi and her family.

Her husband, her two brothers and her brother-in-law worked at the plant or helped build it.

“One of our kids said the plant looks like a big, blue monster,” referring to how the reactor and turbine buildings are painted, Michelassi said. “And we were like, ‘OK, but it pays well.'”

Michelassi is a part-time mayor and the retiring executive director of Prairieland Service Coordination Inc., which provides social services to children with disabilities and others. She says she’s terrified by the pending Medicaid cuts in Washington, D.C., and so is even more grateful for having nuclear power in her town.

“When Meta comes along and says, `Hey, we’ve got AI and we’ll take some of that power,’ that’s like manna from heaven,” Michelassi said.

“It becomes very pragmatic and very small for me,” she said. “It means our emergency services and our hospital and our school district can say, ‘OK, that tax revenue isn’t going anywhere.’ It means Constellation will still be saying, ‘Here’s $5,000. Go buy crayons for kids who can’t buy their own school supplies.'”

A ripple effect

Meta’s impact won’t just be felt in Clinton. It will ripple across the state.

The key question, according to Jackson Morris, director of state energy policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, is whether the company will add deliverable, carbon-free generating capacity such as new wind, solar or nuclear at the same rate at which it’s building data centers.

“It takes 18 to 24 months to build a data center and 10 years to build a nuclear plant,” Morris said. “There’s going to be this messy middle period where we have to speed up the interconnection of new zero-emissions generating resources dramatically to avoid bad consumer and emissions impacts.”

Meta’s Parekh acknowledged the time lag with nuclear. But she said other types of power are coming online faster and are keeping Meta’s clean energy expansion on pace with its data center growth.

“We hold ourselves to making sure there’s enough megawatt hours of clean electricity to support all of the consumption we have in a year,’’ she said.

“We need to ensure that ratepayers have comfort, that their lights stay on and they don’t feel harmed by the innovation that’s happening through AI,’’ Parekh said.

Meta’s clean energy promises would be even more meaningful if, like those from Google’s parent Alphabet, they included only power sources that are new and capable of delivering electricity to the actual data centers that need it, Morris said. That’s not possible if, for example, the power source is on the other side of an ocean from the data center, he said.

Meta says it counts and uses its “attributes’’ in ways that are best for the environment long term and that have already helped it become one of the world’s largest corporate buyers of clean energy. In the case of Clinton, Parekh said, Meta felt it had to act to save a clean power source that may have gone out of business.

“What we heard from Constellation is they had to make a decision soon about the future of this power plant with the state program going away,” she said.

Illinois remains a net energy exporter, thanks to its 11 nuclear reactors, the most of any state. However, a massive shortfall is looming as the state prepares to close 28 gigawatts of coal and natural gas generating plants by 2045.

That’s nearly equal to the 31 gigawatts of electricity that ComEd uses today to power the northern fifth of Illinois, including Chicago.

If Meta’s data center spending does help Illinois wean itself off nuclear subsidies, it will mean one less headache for lawmakers whose first attempt to pass an energy bill this year ended in failure.

In May, the legislature rejected a plan to force data centers and other big electricity users to invest in their own renewable power sources as they grow. If they don’t, they’d have to pay six times as much as other ratepayers into a state fund for subsidizing renewable investments.

Environmentalists pushed for this in part because the fund could start running a deficit in 2028, according to the state’s power agency. Such a deficit would shut down incentives for renewable investments across Illinois.

Amanda Pankau, director of energy issues for the Prairie Rivers Network, a Champaign-based environmental group, said allowing renewable investments to lapse would be a mistake.

“Nuclear is expensive and takes a long time but data centers are looking to connect to the grid quickly,” said Pankau, who lives on a farm 15 miles from the Clinton nuclear plant.

“Wind and solar paired with battery storage is a very cost-effective and quick way to get new capacity on the grid,” she said.

The data center dispute in Springfield helped stall a wide-ranging bill that would have also upgraded the state’s battery storage and energy efficiency programs, as well as its planning and procurement tools to better match electricity-generating investments with long-term demand.

Legislative leaders have promised to try again in October. Depending on when they plan to implement the changes, they may need a three-fifths vote instead of a simple majority. And they’ll face constant complaints about the rising cost of electricity.

In June, average monthly residential bills rose by $14.50 at ComEd and $17 at Ameren just to reserve future generating capacity for regional transmission grids. On a percentage basis, these were both double-digit increases.

In a recent study, the Illinois Power Agency projected continued steep increases in capacity prices for the next quarter century.

“We haven’t seen demand growth like this since World War II and we’ve never seen demand growth that looks like these data centers,” said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We have to make sure with 100% certainty that low-income customers and small businesses are not subsidizing these large loads.

“I get it that Meta might say, ‘It’s up to the state of Illinois and the regional grids to build more clean power, right? My counterargument is, ‘Well, you’re a trillion-dollar company, and you should be part of the solution.'”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/CTC-L-clinton-meta-nuclear045.jpg?w=1024&h=715,N,,2025-07-08 11:11:39.902138

Electricity demand from AI-driven data centers and advanced manufacturing is rising at a record pace.
The magnitude and speed of projected load growth cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.
Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies.
Shapiro Reaches Agreement With PJM To Prevent Unnecessary Price Hikes And Save Consumers Over $21 Billion On Utility Bills [PaEN] -- Gov.","DOE said the analysis reveals that existing generation retirements and delays in adding new firm capacity, driven by the radical green agenda of past administrations, will lead to a surge in power outages and a growing mismatch between electricity demand and supply, particularly from artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data center growth, threatening America’s energy security.

“This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,” said DOE Secretary Wright. “In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power. President Trump’s administration is committed to advancing a strategy of energy addition, and supporting all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure. If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.”

Among the highlights of the report:

-- Grid growth must match the pace of A.I. innovation. Electricity demand from AI-driven data centers and advanced manufacturing is rising at a record pace. The magnitude and speed of projected load growth cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management. Radical change is needed to unleash the transformative potential of innovation.

-- The status quo is unsustainable. DOE’s analysis shows that, if current retirement schedules and incremental additions remain unchanged, most regions will face unacceptable reliability risks within five years and the Nation’s electrical power grid will be unable to meet expected demand for A.I., data centers, manufacturing and industrialization while keeping the cost of living low for all Americans. Staying on the present course would undermine U.S. economic growth, national security, and leadership in emerging technologies.

DOE’s report identifies regions most vulnerable to outages under various weather and retirement scenarios and offers capacity targets needed to restore acceptable reliability.

What About ‘Ordinary People’?

On May 12, PA Senate and House Committees held hearings on how the rapid increase in demand for electricity to power data centers filled with computers is impacting the price and availability of electricity for “ordinary people” on the regional electric grid operated by the PJM Interconnection. Read more here.

Jason Staneck, Executive Director for Governmental Services at PJM, told the committees the unprecedented increases in demand for electricity they are seeing-- “It’s not people.”

“Number one head and shoulders above any other customer is data centers. So it's for everything from bitcoin mining, to generative artificial intelligence, to cloud computing, to just maintaining the consumption of all the devices, the average household now has 21 connected devices.”

“And we see that everywhere, it's become a global arms race for A.I.”

Rep. Danilo Burgos (D-Philadelphia), Majority Chair of the House Consumer Protection, Technology & Utilities Committee, said-- ""You stated [PJM] that people aren't the problem, but yet somehow people continue to carry the load of the payments.

“Our communities like mine and Rep. Ryncavage and across Pennsylvania are going to be hurt with this increase of demand in the future, and I hope that the PJM will consider-- reconsider the way they allow projects to come online.

“Being as though what you stated that either it was lack of financing, or what other excuses that private entities came up with [for not bringing new electric generation online], hopefully will not happen in the future because our communities cannot afford it.”

Sen. Gene Yaw (R-Lycoming), Majority Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, shared his concerns about the impact on “ordinary people.”

“One of the issues that we've talked about is, I want to encourage generation capacity here, but I also want to serve the ordinary people, like everybody here.

“A.I. and data centers are great. I encourage them if we can find a way that they... and what they seem to be doing now is, they're enhancing their own power, so that they have a reliable source, they do it themselves.

“If we have some incentive for generation to come here, I want to make sure that generation goes to the, I can't think of a better word saying other than to say the ordinary people, the residential customers, and that they, quite honestly, can't take advantage of some incentive to come here and build for the limited use of an A.I. center.

“We're looking at that, and we're concerned about that.”

Today marks the 14th anniversary of RNG COALITION, the trade association representing the North American renewable natural gas (RNG) industry. What began in 2011 with a few stakeholders in a nascent industry has become a cornerstone of the continent’s renewable energy foundation and future.

“Fourteen years ago, when we introduced upgraded biogas or biomethane in North America as RNG, few knew what we were talking about,” said Johannes Escudero, founder and CEO of RNG COALITION. “Today, RNG is a recognized commodity that is having a positive impact on our economy and environment — and influencing the future of energy in the United States and around the world.”

RNG Coalition was founded on the principle that methane produced from society’s waste streams — landfills, diverted food waste, farms, and wastewater facilities — should not be wasted (flared) or vented into the atmosphere, but should be turned into clean, renewable energy. That proposition has since been proven at scale. In June, the COALITION celebrated its most significant milestone to date: surpassing 500 operational RNG facilities across the U.S. and Canada, meeting its 2025 SMART initiative benchmark six months early.

SMART — short for Sustainable Methane Abatement & Recycling Timeline — outlines a clear vision to capture methane from more than 43,000 organic waste sites by 2050. The next benchmark: doubling the industry footprint to 1,000 facilities by the end of 2030. Already, 153 facilities are under construction and another 293 are in development, bringing the active project pipeline close to that targeted 1,000-facility figure.

“The markets that put our industry on the map are the work product of effective policy advocacy at federal, state and provincial levels of government,” said Sam Wade, VP of Public Policy for RNG COALITION. “We’ve laid the groundwork for RNG to meet rising energy demand from transportation, manufacturing, power generation, and emerging sectors like AI-driven data centers.”

RNG COALITION’s nearly 400 member companies span every link in the value chain and share a commitment to energy innovation and environmental responsibility. Together, they have helped establish RNG as one of the few climate solutions that is operational, scalable, and delivering sustainable results now — and for generations to come.

As RNG COALITION enters its 15th year, the organization remains committed to advancing its mission, achieving its 2030 SMART initiative benchmark, and influencing the future of energy through leadership, education, advocacy, development and sustainability.

(NYSE:AMRC) announced Tuesday its partnership with Juneau Hydropower, Inc. to develop, construct and operate a 19.8 megawatt hydroelectric facility at Sweetheart Lake, located 33 miles south of downtown Juneau, Alaska.

The Sweetheart Lake Hydroelectric Facility is designed to generate approximately 116,000 megawatt-hours annually, which would increase Juneau’s baseload clean hydropower by 20%. The project includes installation of a battery energy storage system, over 40 miles of high-voltage transmission infrastructure with eight miles of undersea cable crossing Gilbert Bay, and an interconnection substation. With a current ratio of 1.57, Ameresco maintains adequate liquidity to support such large-scale infrastructure projects, though InvestingPro data indicates the company operates with a significant debt burden.

According to the press release, the facility will connect remote areas previously dependent on diesel generation to renewable energy sources. The project aims to enhance grid reliability in a region that has experienced extended power outages due to extreme weather, including a 2008 avalanche that caused outages lasting up to two months.

""This project is the catalyst for Juneau’s sustained growth and prosperity,"" said Duff Mitchell, Managing Director of Juneau Hydropower, in the statement.

The hydroelectric dam is expected to offset 82,012 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually. One planned customer is Coeur Alaska, Inc.’s Kensington Mine, which currently relies on diesel generators but is expected to transition to renewable energy once the facility becomes operational.

Nicole Bulgarino, President of Federal Solutions and Utility Infrastructure at Ameresco, called the project ""a major milestone for both Alaska, Juneau Power and Ameresco.""

The partnership includes a long-term operations and maintenance contract to ensure sustained performance. The project is anticipated to increase overall energy transmission in Alaska by 3%, according to the company’s announcement.

In other recent news, Ameresco, Inc. has announced the renewal of its contract with the Government of Nunavut for providing enterprise asset management software and services. This partnership, which began in 2011, involves the continued use of Ameresco’s AssetPlanner platform to manage a vast portfolio of assets. In a notable development, Ameresco is also involved in an innovative energy efficiency project at the U.S. Army’s Detroit Arsenal, utilizing 3D printing technology to enhance building insulation. This project, part of the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program, aims to improve energy efficiency by 50%.

Additionally, Ameresco is competing for a substantial $3 billion energy and water conservation contract alongside other U.S. companies. The contract, overseen by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, focuses on reducing energy and water consumption and associated costs. In financial news, UBS analysts have raised Ameresco’s stock price target to $11 from $8, citing optimism about the company’s federal contracting business, which constitutes a significant portion of its project backlog. Despite this increase, UBS maintains a cautious outlook due to uncertainties around tariff impacts and federal contracts.

Moreover, Ameresco has completed a $71 million sale of Investment Tax Credits related to its renewable natural gas projects, marking its first sale under new transferability rules. This transaction underscores Ameresco’s expertise in leveraging clean energy incentives and financing. The sale, facilitated by STX Group, highlights the growing market confidence in renewable natural gas as part of the clean energy transition.

JRW: Justin R. Wolf

JRW:

It’s a 180 on everything that was accomplished or expanded upon as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. I think it’s a misunderstanding that a lot of the tax credits that were embedded in the IRA were established through the IRA. In fact, they were established 20 years prior with the Clean Energy Act in 2005. But the IRA extended, expanded, and embedded those tax credits—notably, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit, or 25C and 25D, to use the tax codes—and extended those through 2032. It really popularized these incentives to push homeowners and contractors and manufacturers to invest a lot in these industries, to invest in solar and battery storage and wind and renewables and everything across the board with clean energy investments. It was a big deal.

I agree with you that the IRA’s rollout was a bit bumpy. It wasn’t how the Green New Deal was envisioned. There were concessions, but I would argue its biggest fault was that the Biden administration did a lousy job of promoting what it was and what it had accomplished. No one to this day knows what the Inflation Reduction Act is, and they should. It was a momentous piece of legislation, and it’s getting burned to the ground by an arguably bigger piece of legislation.

JRW:

Not all of them. The biggest thing that is going to get eliminated at the end of this year is the 25D credit, which is commonly known as the residential solar tax credit. It offers consumers a 30% tax credit on any solar that’s installed on their rooftops or on their property.

Battery storage plugins, residential plugins, EV incentives, etc., those tax credits go away at the end of 2025. Others are getting phased out. For example, commercial solar projects or residential solar that is third-party owned—meaning, if you’re leasing or entering into a power purchase agreement (PPA) to put solar on your roof—the tax credits associated with those aren’t going away immediately. If you’re installing them after July 4, 2026, a year after BBB was signed, then it must be completed by the end of 2027 to qualify for a 30% tax credit.

JRW:

Yes. The existing tax credit was extended and expanded with the IRA in 2022. All of these tax credits were supposed to sunset in 2032. They were expanded because the tax credits in their previous forms were pretty limited in what they offered. They were nice incentives, but with some pretty conservative returns.

Originally, you would have a lifetime cap on a home efficiency credit of a few hundred bucks. Meaning: If you wanted to put new insulation in your home this year and add new doors and windows next year, and then get rid of your gas boiler and install a heat pump, all of that stuff, in past years you’d have a lifetime cap on that. It didn’t matter if you’re doing it sequentially year after year as your finances allow. The IRA increased the credit and established an annual cap, so there was more incentive for homeowners to phase home improvement projects rather than do it all in one fell swoop. Who can afford to do that? Who can afford to replace their HVAC system, add new insulation, new windows, new doors, a heat pump water heater, all at once? No, you phase it. And that was great about the tax credit. It was capped at 30%, one year after the next. That’s going away.

JRW:

Well, the Big Beautiful Bill, or I believe as you referred to it in an email, as a “big bag of bullshit” …

JRW:

I do not disagree with that characterization. The BBB will basically make it harder for a lot of that stuff to come online, for it to be interconnected with the grid, because the interconnection queue on a lot of those big renewable projects is already bottlenecking. This administration has demonstrated little appetite for allowing any renewable energy developments to occur. But—and this may be my own foolish optimism coming to the fore—it will be impossible to put all the toothpaste back in the tube.

JRW:

The global energy transition is going to continue moving in the right direction, but the United States will cease to be a leader in that transition. The Inflation Reduction Act was very rapidly positioning the U.S. at the vanguard of that movement. China is going to accelerate solar production. They’re going to accelerate offshore wind. They are going to be the global leader in the renewable energy transition.

The U.S. can still make headway. If we want to find positive takeaways in this legislation, there are some. It’s a win for the geothermal industry and for things like utility-scale battery storage projects. It also requires more domestic content in large commercial solar developments as they come online in the next few years—if those projects are going to qualify for the 48E 30% tax credit. So, in some ways, it’s incentivizing more domestic production of photovoltaics and the deployment of large commercial developments, even if it’s kneecapping homeowners and not giving them the incentives to add rooftop solar, which is also sorely needed. It’s a mixed bag, but the ultimate takeaway is that this is compromising the country’s position to be a global leader in renewable energy production and community clean energy investments.

JRW:

Yes. For all of the talk of a manufacturing recession, or the idea that we don’t build things here anymore, we were building renewable energy manufacturing capacity, in large part due to the IRA, the CHIPS Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. Those three key pieces of legislation passed by the Biden-Harris administration were supercharging domestic manufacturing and investing billions, particularly in the Rust Belt and Bible Belt states.

JRW:

Well, go into bear mode, definitely. A lot of jobs are going to get lost as a result of this. But there are going to be a lot of installers and contractors who were in business prior to this legislation—and hopefully they continue to be in business, although probably not with the same profit margins. But there’s still going to be leadership at the state level. There will still be a lot of consumer rebates available for home efficiency upgrades, for installing solar, for purchasing a new or used EV, or installing battery storage on your property. Not every incentive is going away, but the federal support for many of those programs is gone.

It’s going to be very hard for a lot of these companies to weather the storm, and harder for more of them to survive, especially for small business owners and small contractors. That’s the tough part. I live in Maine, a state that is made up almost exclusively of small businesses. It’s a lot of sole-proprietor LLCs or contractors with only a few staff. They’re out there, knocking on doors, selling energy audits and blower door tests, presenting the case for making people’s homes more efficient, cleaner, and healthier.

For me, the biggest takeaway is this: almost 25% of U.S. electricity production comes from renewable sources. We’ve reached that! It’s hard to predict how much that number is going to increase in the next five years, or if it’s going to get smaller or remain stagnant. But the more renewables and energy storage that we bring online, and the more we’re able to co-locate large renewable energy infrastructure projects with large demands like data centers, the sooner we can achieve a cleaner, healthier, more reliable grid.

“Congressman David Valadao is doing exactly what he promised: delivering real results, restoring fiscal sanity, and fighting for California families,” NRCC spokesman Christian Martinez said.
Republicans have a paper-thin House majority — as demonstrated by the 218-214 final vote on Trump’s high priority bill — and Valadao, Kim and Calvert barely survived past challenges.
“At a height of 6-feet-4, Rep. David Valadao can cast a giant presence in Washington, D.C.,” The Bee’s editorial board wrote.
However, Valadao’s vote for Trump’s bill undermines that independent image and will almost certainly be weaponized as Democrats try again to capture his seat next year.","Last Thursday, just minutes after the House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” to overhaul federal taxes and health care spending, the National Republican Campaign Committee issued a statement touting Rep. David Valadao’s vote for the controversial measure.

“In a major win for Californians, David Valadao just voted to pass landmark legislation that lowers taxes, boosts economic growth, strengthens essential benefits, and restores law and order in California,” the NRCC declared.

“Congressman David Valadao is doing exactly what he promised: delivering real results, restoring fiscal sanity, and fighting for California families,” NRCC spokesman Christian Martinez said. “His vote is proof that strong leadership and commonsense still matter in Washington.”

A couple of hours later, Protect Our Care California, a health care advocacy organization with close ties to Democratic Party leaders, announced that it will air video ads criticizing Valadao and nine other Republican congressional members for their votes.

“Representative David Valadao just voted for the largest health care cuts in history in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations, and we’re going to make sure that every single one of their constituents knows it,” said Matthew Herdman, director of Protect Our Care California.

The ads are aimed at Valadao and other members of California’s Republican congressional delegation, including Young Kim and Ken Calvert, because they are considered to be the most vulnerable incumbents as the two major parties battle over control over the House in next year’s elections.

Republicans have a paper-thin House majority — as demonstrated by the 218-214 final vote on Trump’s high priority bill — and Valadao, Kim and Calvert barely survived past challenges. Valadao first won a congressional seat in 2012, lost it in 2018 and regained it in 2020. He successfully fended off Democrat Rudy Salas in 2022 and 2024.

What happens in the three targeted districts next year could easily determine which party will prevail, with potentially major consequences for the final two years of Trump’s presidency.

Valadao’s vote for the bill is especially noteworthy because Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by 12 percentage points in the San Joaquin Valley’s 22nd Congressional District, two-thirds of his constituents rely on Medi-Cal (California’s version of Medicaid) for their health care, and he had repeatedly promised not to vote for any reductions in the program.

The Fresno Bee’s editorial page quickly excoriated him for seemingly abandoning that pledge under pressure from Trump.

“At a height of 6-feet-4, Rep. David Valadao can cast a giant presence in Washington, D.C.,” The Bee’s editorial board wrote. “Unfortunately, he doesn’t measure up when it comes to looking out for the best interests of his community.”

The editorial continued, “The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency, estimated that the Senate version of the bill, which was eventually passed, reduces federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over 10 years and increases the number of uninsured people by 11.8 million.

“What happened to Valadao in five days to change his mind? For one thing, he visited the White House on Wednesday. His office didn’t provide details of that reunion, but Trump has used such meetings to pressure reluctant lawmakers to do his bidding over that of the people.”

Valadao insists that he received assurances from the White House that the Medicaid cuts will “be structured in a way that benefits our providers and keeps our hospitals and communities running.”

Aware of his precarious hold on the seat, Valadao has continuously stressed his independence, even being one of only 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump during his first presidential reign.

However, Valadao’s vote for Trump’s bill undermines that independent image and will almost certainly be weaponized as Democrats try again to capture his seat next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092222-DAVID-VALADAO-REUTERS-GS-CM.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-08 13:34:39.000966

What began with the policy reforms of the 1970s and 1990s is now accelerating due to federal mandates, technological advances, and growing demand for flexible, decentralized energy solutions.

In this three-part Op-Ed series, we explore the forces shaping today’s DER markets—from regulatory milestones to the technical infrastructure enabling real-time participation in wholesale energy markets.

Part One of this series begins with a look at the regulatory foundation that opened U.S. energy markets to competition and laid the groundwork for DER integration.

The roots of DER markets – how federal policy opened the grid

The integration of Distributed Energy Resources or DERs – such as solar, storage, and demand response—into U.S. energy markets is accelerating, driven by regulatory reform and technological innovation. FERC Order 2222 mandates that ISOs and RTOs accommodate aggregated DERs, forming the basis for Virtual Power Plants (VPPs). Yet, participation remains complex, requiring strict compliance with metering, telemetry, and dispatch standards.

This paper traces the evolution of DER integration, highlights technical and regulatory requirements across major markets, and emphasizes the critical role of data and analytics. Successful market access demands advanced metering, intelligent controls, and deep regulatory fluency. As DERs become essential to grid reliability and decarbonization, stakeholders must invest in scalable, interoperable systems to unlock the full economic and operational value of distributed energy.

Introduction

The integration of DERs into the U.S. electricity grid is transforming the energy landscape. The efforts to allow non-utility generation that began with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act or PURPA in the late 1970s has been followed more than five decades later by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Order No. 2222, which mandates that Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) revise their market rules to allow DER aggregations to participate in wholesale markets.

The development of demand response programs allowed the organized markets, with the help of market participants, to advance their protocols and innovative companies to develop technologies to support distributed energy resource aggregations, which we now refer to as Virtual Power Plants.

Each ISO/RTO faces unique challenges in implementing these changes, reflecting regional grid characteristics, regulatory environments, utility’s willingness to adapt, and other stakeholder dynamics. Here we provide some perspective on the evolution of the markets, technologies and market rules that have enabled this part of the energy transition.

A look back at history: The legislation that opened energy markets

The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA), enacted in 1978 as part of the National Energy Act, marked a transformative shift in the structure of the U.S. electricity market. Passed in response to the energy crises of the 1970s, PURPA aimed to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and promote energy conservation and efficiency. One of its most groundbreaking elements was opening the door for non-utility generation—introducing competition into what had been a monopolized industry.

At its core, the Act mandated that electric utilities purchase power from qualifying facilities, or QFs, at the utility’s “avoided cost”—the cost the utility would incur to generate or purchase the power elsewhere. The QFs were typically cogeneration plants or combined heat and power (CHP) associated with larger loads. The introduction of QFs had profound implications for local electric distribution systems.

Previously, distribution infrastructure was designed for one-way power flow from centralized utility generators to end-users. With the advent of distributed QFs, especially CHP embedded within local grids, utilities had to adapt to a new paradigm of two-way power flow and decentralized energy inputs.

This necessitated upgrades to metering, protection systems, and grid management practices. Utilities also faced operational and economic challenges, such as load balancing and voltage regulation, as more independent sources entered the grid.

However, PURPA also created opportunities—diversifying generation sources, improving grid resilience, and encouraging technological innovation in power systems. By creating a market mechanism for non-utility generation to compete with traditional utilities, PURPA fostered innovation and competition that continue to shape today’s energy landscape. It was the first step toward unbundling generation from transmission and distribution, a concept that has since become a cornerstone of modern electricity markets.

Power markets evolve – Driven by policy and information technology

The Energy Policy Act of 1992 marked a transformative moment in U.S. electricity policy. It amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and the Federal Power Act (FPA) to enable and advance competition in the wholesale electricity market.

The Act allowed FERC to require utilities to provide open access to their transmission lines. It further enabled non-utility generators (independent power producers, or IPPs) to transmit power over the lines of traditional utilities – facilitating something called “wheeling”. This all created a legal pathway for new entrants to generate and sell electricity without traditional regulatory burdens. Although the Act didn’t create wholesale markets directly, it gave FERC the tools to facilitate such markets.

Competition in the retail markets drives innovation

Retail electricity market restructuring in the U.S. began in the 1990s, with states like California, New Jersey, Illinois, and Texas. There is no deregulation at the national or federal level. Deregulation allowed retail customers to choose their electricity providers and in most cases decoupled generation from delivery service.

California launched its effort in 1998, though early challenges, including the 2000–2001 energy crisis, slowed momentum. New Jersey and Illinois followed with programs designed to allow customers, especially commercial and industrial ones, to shop for competitive rates. Texas, particularly with its ERCOT-managed grid, created one of the most robust competitive markets beginning in 2002.

Competition encouraged innovation, giving rise to new products and services tailored to customer needs. Retail energy providers introduced variable and fixed-rate plans, green energy options, prepaid electricity and bundled energy services. Additionally, competition spurred investment in customer-facing technologies such as smart meters and web-based energy management tools.

While the extent and success of competition can be debated, it did catalyze a more consumer-centric energy market, laying the foundation for today’s evolving landscape of distributed energy resources and digital energy platforms.

This was designed for an earlier era when electricity prices were lower and there was a need to preserve the price signal to conserve.
And higher electricity prices mean customers buy fewer electric vehicles, heat pumps and other electric technologies needed to phase out fossil fuel burning.
Reduce residential electricity prices The first simple change would be to use the current electricity climate credit to directly reduce residential electricity prices.
California can better use this existing program to help lower electricity prices while continuing to reduce pollution.","Rising electricity costs in California is a problem that is only getting worse. PG&E has raised rates six times in the last 18 months, and electricity prices across the state have increased 30 percentage points faster than inflation since 2019. As a result, 4.3 million Californians have fallen behind on their payments — and they want lawmakers to take action.

Across the state, 79% of voters say that the government should do more to limit price increases by for-profit utility companies, according to a recent poll from The Utility Reform Network and California Environmental Voters.

Thankfully, California lawmakers have options at their fingertips to provide both immediate rate relief and address longer-term affordability without any new programs or funding.

In 2006, Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act, was signed into law. Under the landmark cap-and-trade program created by the legislation, the state specifies a total limit on climate pollution, and polluters must pay for their emissions through a carbon market. The value of California’s cap and trade program is nearly $10 billion per year, generating a significant amount of revenue for the state.

This year, the state will return $1.4 billion of these funds to millions of utility customers as “climate credits” on their electric bills. The electricity credit shows up as twice-a-year credits, with every household served by a participating utility (including PG&E, SoCal Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Company) getting the same amount, regardless of how much electricity they use. This was designed for an earlier era when electricity prices were lower and there was a need to preserve the price signal to conserve.

Today, however, electricity prices are too high. And higher electricity prices mean customers buy fewer electric vehicles, heat pumps and other electric technologies needed to phase out fossil fuel burning.

Lawmakers could make two simple changes to how electricity climate credits are distributed to better support California households — especially low-income families and those in the hottest regions who face the highest cooling costs. This is especially relevant as extreme heat becomes more common.

Reduce residential electricity prices

The first simple change would be to use the current electricity climate credit to directly reduce residential electricity prices. A recent analysis from my research group, the Environmental Markets Lab at UC Santa Barbara, finds that this change would result in significant savings for all residential customers.

If applied year-round to all households, we find that funds from the climate credit together with the electricity rate reform set to go into effect in 2026 (which will reduce prices by 10% on average) would lower electricity prices by 18-26%.

The program could also be structured to provide year-round relief just for low-income households (as defined by the California Alternate Rates for Energy program), for which electricity bills represent a far greater percentage of monthly income.

With this program design, climate credits aimed at rate relief by themselves (even without the already planned 2026 rate reforms) would lower electricity prices by 27-44%. And if relief were focused for all households on just the summer months when electricity use is highest, climate credit funds on their own could lower prices by 13-19%, allowing households — particularly those exposed to extreme heat — to either save money or run their air conditioning longer and cooler.

Electricity rate relief

Second, if a portion of the climate credit that is currently delivered to reduce customers’ gas bills is reallocated to electricity rate relief, it would provide additional support to the millions of Californians struggling with their electric bills and further incentivize the transition to cleaner, healthier, more efficient electric vehicles and appliances.

California is widely viewed as a climate leader, in large part because our cap-and-trade program is a proven, successful policy that is both reducing emissions in a cost-effective manner and funding important climate priorities. California can better use this existing program to help lower electricity prices while continuing to reduce pollution.",https://www.star-telegram.com/energy/sw379q/picture290928164/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/How%20to%20Lower%20Your%20Electric%20Bill%20This%20Summer,N,,2025-07-08 09:12:34.086395

The shift away from fossil fuels has often failed to fully consider the needs of affected workers and fenceline communities.
Without a well-managed transition, industrial decarbonization could result in local job losses and economic disruption.
Fortunately for both industrial communities and the broader economy, environmental well-being and economic well-being are not mutually exclusive.
Balance Environmental and Economic Priorities * Industrial decarbonization strategies should simultaneously advance local pollution reduction and environmental remediation, energy affordability and job creation.","As the global economy shifts toward cleaner and more efficient manufacturing and production, the U.S. has the opportunity to create healthier communities and increase climate resilience as it shapes a more prosperous economic future.

The U.S. industrial sector is both a backbone of the economy — employing around 8% of all U.S. workers — and a major source of pollution, accounting for nearly 30% of national greenhouse gas emissions and much of the country’s hazardous air pollution. People in places like Louisiana’s 85-mile stretch of Cancer Alley between Baton Rouge and New Orleans have long suffered from factories releasing harmful toxins into the air, land and water.

Decarbonizing the highest emitting industries — steel, cement and chemicals — by boosting energy efficiency, deploying carbon capture and storage where appropriate and shifting away from fossil fuels can simultaneously cut climate-warming greenhouse gases and the toxic air and water pollutants that endanger communities.

By leaning into the fast-growing global market for low-carbon products, U.S. industry can stay competitive without repeating past patterns of pushing pollution burdens onto people and ecosystems. However, if worker and community-focused safeguards are not considered, this shift could trigger job losses, disrupt local economies and, if technologies like hydrogen or carbon dioxide pipelines are poorly regulated, introduce new environmental and health risks for nearby communities.

Centering Communities in Efforts to Decarbonize

Over the past six months, several federal policy reversals have clouded the outlook for clean-industry investment: the recission of several billion dollars in competitive grants for novel low-carbon projects, major corporate mergers in heavy industry were approved without emissions enforcement or guarantees for community reinvestment and carbon-pollution limits for power plants have been weakened.

Against this backdrop, efforts to reindustrialize and modernize American manufacturing to energy-efficient systems must still align innovation and climate action with economic revitalization, workforce development, environmental protection and public health improvements.

Importantly, the U.S. must not repeat past mistakes while creating and modernizing industrial facilities. Historically, fenceline communities — people who live near industrial facilities, which are often made up of residents from low-income backgrounds or communities of color — have long faced disproportionate pollution exposure and shouldered the public health burden of these industries.

Many fenceline communities exist today because of intentional government policies and practices, such as redlining and racially discriminatory zoning and disinvestment, which forced economically marginalized and politically excluded groups to live in what’s become known as ""sacrifice zones."" This reflects patterns of historic underinvestment and environmental harm imposed on economically and socially marginalized populations.

For example, people in fenceline communities throughout Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, which accounts for 25% of the petrochemical production within the U.S. from more than 200 factories, have an abnormally high cancer risk, with the risk being even higher for low-income people and people of color.

Prioritizing clean air and water, economic revitalization and community-driven decision-making is critical to addressing historical harms and making industrial decarbonization efforts durable. When communities are engaged meaningfully early on, policies and projects are more likely to earn public trust, avoid local opposition and secure the long-term support needed to sustain industrial transitions. Furthermore, such a shift can create economic benefits, such as reducing health care costs from improved air quality and fostering public and worker support for decarbonization initiatives, which are essential for durably scaling these efforts.

The shift away from fossil fuels has often failed to fully consider the needs of affected workers and fenceline communities. For instance, thousands of refinery workers could be left stranded as California phases down its petroleum refining. Beyond a handful of refinery-specific initiatives, just transition planning across the broader industrial landscape — particularly in steel, cement and chemicals — remains scarce.

If today’s industrial modernization and decarbonization efforts ignore workers, communities and environmental impacts, they could repeat past mistakes of accelerating plant closures without offering alternative economic opportunities, concentrating environmental risks in fenceline communities, eroding community trust and potentially delaying or canceling projects.

The Economic Case for a People-Centered Transition

Recent analysis from McKinsey & Company estimates that an economy-wide net-zero transition by 2050 could lead to 200 million new direct and indirect jobs while also causing a loss of 185 million jobs — resulting in a net gain of 15 million jobs worldwide by 2050. Without a well-managed transition, industrial decarbonization could result in local job losses and economic disruption.

Beyond avoiding the substantial economic risks and losses from climate change, modernizing U.S. industry in a way that prioritizes workers and communities can help revive historic manufacturing regions, attract investment and boost their economic prosperity. And at the same time, it would allow the U.S. to capitalize on deploying innovative new industrial technologies.

As the global economy shifts toward cleaner and more efficient manufacturing, innovative industrial production methods that utilize cleaner energy sources will become better positioned to compete globally. And as global markets and private sector buyers start prioritizing lower-carbon industrial products, U.S. government policies such as subsidies and technology demonstration grants are needed to proactively drive industrial innovation and ensure domestic industries don’t fall behind in a rapidly changing market.

At the same time, successful decarbonization projects will depend not only on market shifts and technological advancements, but also on how people are included. When the needs of workers, fenceline communities and local stakeholders are not addressed as part of transitions, companies risk encountering public opposition, costly legal challenges, project delays or cancellations, and increased costs associated with those risks, slowing progress.

For example, some experts have warned that if the financial and social burdens of the clean-industry shift — such as higher energy rates or job losses — fall disproportionately on lower-income households, workers or fenceline communities while benefits accrue elsewhere, public support for net-zero initiatives could erode, making it harder to pass and implement effective policies. And, while they recognize industry’s negative impact on air and water pollution, many members of fenceline communities rank economic considerations like job security as a far higher priority than local environmental well-being in surveys.

Fortunately for both industrial communities and the broader economy, environmental well-being and economic well-being are not mutually exclusive. For example, in the U.S., past policies that directed clean energy investments toward historically marginalized communities sought to support workforce transitions and strengthen declining local economies.

Strategies for Inclusive and Resilient Industrial Decarbonization

To support responsible and equitable industrial decarbonization that aligns with economic opportunity and long-term community resilience, policymakers and developers should consider several strategies:

Create Industry Transition RoadmapsIndustry roadmaps that combine modernization pathways with steps for workforce transition can help policymakers proactively create long-term reskilling and job placement strategies when retrofitting, replacing and retiring heavy-polluting industrial facilities.Invest in Workforce Training and Reskilling

* Decarbonization should be paired with reskilling initiatives, wage protections, and local hiring mandates to minimize job displacement.

* Targeted investments in vocational training, apprenticeship programs and STEM education can equip workers with the skills needed for new, clean industry jobs.

Prioritize Community Benefits

* Community benefit plans or agreements, participatory planning processes and local advisory boards ensure fenceline communities have a key role in shaping industrial projects.

* Developers and policymakers should engage communities early and consistently to increase transparency and trust in new decarbonization efforts.

Balance Environmental and Economic Priorities

* Industrial decarbonization strategies should simultaneously advance local pollution reduction and environmental remediation, energy affordability and job creation.

* Policies should avoid short-term economic disruptions by pairing emissions reductions measures with incentives for the use and reuse of recently closed or declining industrial sites for clean manufacturing, energy efficiency, and infrastructure investment.

Ensure Environmental and Worker Safety in Industrial Shifts* Conduct cumulative impact assessments to ensure that decarbonization technologies (e.g., hydrogen, carbon capture and storage) do not introduce health or safety risks for workers and nearby communities.

* Strengthening worker safety regulations and health protections ensures that industrial shifts do not lead to new forms of harm.

Embed Community Trust and Protective Safeguards* Require every project to offer two-way engagement forums (listening sessions, advisory boards, co-design workshops) that communities can join if they choose.

* Establish anti-displacement safeguards (e.g., property-tax relief, affordable-housing set-asides) to prevent gentrification as new projects raise land values.

Carrying Momentum Forward Amid Federal Rollbacks

In recent years, the U.S. federal government made considerable progress toward a more equitable transition to a low-carbon economy. For example, the Justice40 Initiative sought to ensure that some of the economic gains and environmental benefits of climate investments flowed to economically marginalized and environmentally overburdened communities. Incentives like the Energy Community Tax Credit Bonus were designed to help preserve jobs in regions historically dependent on fossil fuel industries.

However, many of these efforts at the federal level have been scaled back, weakened or eliminated in the first half of 2025. These rollbacks not only disadvantage communities and workers but could also create uncertainty for companies that may rely on stable incentives and local support.

In the absence of strong federal direction, state and local governments and forward-looking companies will need to take the lead on responsible and fair decarbonization. Several states, including Colorado and Illinois, have implemented workforce transition funds, targeting clean industrial investments that prioritize job retention and local economic benefits. Industry leaders can also adopt voluntary commitments that strengthen public trust and reduce project risks, such as prioritizing U.S.-based supply chains to avoid carbon leakage, investing in worker training, and engaging with host communities early and consistently to develop community benefits frameworks. These strategies go beyond good public relations — they also avoid delays, legal challenges and reputational damage.

Industrial modernization and decarbonization are not merely about cutting emissions — they are about building a more resilient, competitive and inclusive economy that benefits both industry and the communities that sustain it. By implementing fair and responsible policies and practices that recognize the value of workers and communities, the U.S. manufacturing can position itself toward long-term success in a rapidly changing global economy.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-06/baton-rouge-indudstrial-area_0.jpg?VersionId=nS9q6OOlesNhKkxD8gjBjSzHkD3OcqeD&h=ac778ff2&itok=TgBsq1S-,N,,2025-07-08 09:11:35.790918

The new executive order tells the Treasury to restrict safe harbour provisions “unless a substantial portion” of a project has been built and to prevent the “artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” for these projects.

It also instructs the secretary to take “prompt action” to implement the “enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act”.

The FEOC restrictions set out increasingly strict parameters for “material assistance” from specified foreign countries, most notably China, which controls much of the global solar supply chain capacity.

Finally, the bill instructs the Secretary of the Interior, which controls federal and tribal lands across the US, to “revise” and “eliminate” any policies which supposedly provide “preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources”.

Analysis – political will

Monday’s executive order came just three days after Trump signed the tax reconciliation bill into law – a bill which has been closely tied to the president and seen as a hallmark of his presidency.

Voting on the bill was a close-run thing. Voting was tied in the Senate and required vice-president JD Vance to break the stalemate, and the final version passed the House with a majority of just four – 218 vs 214.

This executive order seems to go beyond the administrative measures and text of the bill to harden the Treasury’s approach to solar and wind projects. It describes “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar”, the growth of which it claims “displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape”.

Renewable energy industry figures have pointed to the damage that scrapping tax incentives will do to the wider US economy. Electricity demand is growing in the US, and solar PV has come to meet much of that growing demand. 50GW of new capacity was added in 2024, according to data from market research firm Wood Mackenzie, more than any other renewable or fossil fuel technology.

Solar has also provided a lot of power to major US corporations, particularly the big tech firms whose CEOs sat pride of place at Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

The language of this executive order, and its apparent effort to stymie solar development beyond the provisions reached in Congress, chimes with the sentiments expressed in the ultra-conservative Project 2025 document associated with Trump before his re-election.

As PV Tech reported back in January, the document describes “The Biden Administration’s assault on the energy sector…forcing the economy to build out and rely on unreliable renewables.” It also advocates a broad reduction of government spending, tax cuts and the primacy of executive power.

“‘Climate-friendly,’ ‘biodegradable,’ or ‘CO2-neutral’ – advertising claims like these sound positive, but it is often unclear what exactly they mean,” said justice minister Stefanie Hubig. “We want to change that.”

In the future, general environmental claims about a product will only be permitted if they can be substantiated. Advertising claims about future environmental performance, such as ‘all our packaging will be fully recyclable by 2030’, must be accompanied by “a realistic, publicly available implementation plan.” Advertising a product with a CO2 offsetting statement such as ‘climate neutral’ will be prohibited if the ‘climate neutrality’ of the product is achieved through the purchase of CO2 certificates.

• Political Roundabout is an occasional column on campaign, legislative and political news with a suburban focus.","U.S. Rep. Sean Casten on Monday demanded the reinstatement of EPA employees he said were punished after accusing the Trump administration of politicizing the agency.

More than 135 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency workers, including 31 from the Chicago area, were put on leave by Administrator Lee Zeldin last week after signing a letter of dissent, American Federation of Government Employees Local 704 said.

Workers wrote that Zeldin may have violated the Hatch Act by using the EPA’s website and social media to promote President Donald Trump’s tariffs and “big beautiful bill.” It also stated the administration was easing regulations against toxins like mercury and asbestos, cutting aid to curb pollution in low-income communities, and firing scientists and researchers.

“This is deeply offensive,” Casten said Monday at a news conference downtown that included Local 704 and elected officials. “It is unethical, it is opposite to everything the EPA stands for, and it is deeply opposed to the idea that we’re going to actually going to leave the planet safer for our children.

“I want to thank all of you for your bravery,” Casten told EPA staff at the event. “My God, if we don’t stand up now — we are going to deserve what’s coming.”

The Downers Grove Democrat was joined by U.S. Rep. Jesús “Chuy” Garcia, who noted his 4th Congressional District that stretches into suburban Cook, contains a number of polluted sites that need EPA oversight.

“What has occurred here is a real travesty,” Garcia said. “I want the professionals who make this agency run to know that we have their backs.”

EPA responds

“The Environmental Protection Agency has a zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging, and undercutting the administration’s agenda as voted for by the great people of this country last November,” an EPA spokesperson said.

Officials indicated the letter signers represented a small fraction of EPA staff.

Stratton hits milestone

Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton announced last week she’s over the $1 million fundraising mark in her campaign for the U.S. Senate seat now held by outgoing lawmaker Dick Durbin.

The Chicago Democrat jumped into the March 17, 2026, primary race in early May. Other major contenders include U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly of Lynwood.

Krishnamoorthi leads in the war chest department currently, with over $19 million raised, according to federal records.

Bipartisan cheers for slashing drug costs

The last word goes to Illinois Senate Republican Leader John Curran, who explained why he supported House Bill 1697, signed into law by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker on July 1.

The initiative will “bring fairness, transparency, and accountability to the process of how prices are set in local pharmacies for medications that people need access to,” the Downers Grove Republican said.

“The rising costs of health care are crushing family budgets across the state, and I am hopeful that this bipartisan bill will be able to provide some desperately needed relief.”

The policy is intended to curb “predatory practices” by pharmacy benefit managers to pile on costs to prescriptions, supporters said. The law prohibits PMBs from profiting on medications by overcharging health plans and bans steering business to pharmacies they own. It also requires audits.

That’s according to Jason Few, CEO of fuel cell company Fuelcell Energy. In a statement, Few praised the OBBBA as a “landmark for American energy leadership.” “Clean energy was not sidelined. In fact, the bill includes direct, powerful provisions that support the fuel cell industry,” said Few.

He specifically highlighted the reinstatement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) as crucial for the sector. The option of tax credits enables continued strong support for fuel cell technologies, allowing large-scale deployment of production platforms based in the U.S.

Equally important, he noted, is the maintained transferability of these tax credits. “It’s particularly important for small- and mid-sized companies to maintain the ability to monetize these credits,” Few said. This, in turn, makes project financing easier, paving the way for additional production shifts and new jobs.

Fuelcell Energy CEO Fews also welcomed the revised hydrogen provisions in the OBBBA, which secure investments in this area. Overall, Few views the OBBBA as a key step toward an innovative, U.S.-developed and -led energy policy, particularly relevant for data center infrastructure and grid stability.

“If you were to buy the same amount of energy today, you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere,” he said.
Federal licensing Unlike wind or solar projects, hydro facilities require a federal license that must be renewed every 30-50 years.
Because water is a shared resource, plants often have to deal with dozens of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.","Inside the Sault hydro-electric plant in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, 74 turbines are spinning and generating power for thousands of homes in the region.

This narrow plant is a quarter-mile long and its red sandstone bricks harken back to the Gilded Age when the plant first opened in 1902.

“It’s been running pretty much 24/7, 365 since then,” said Roger Line, a director of generation with the Cloverland Electric Cooperative, which owns the plant today.

The newest turbines are 113 years old and run smoothly, but Line said Cloverland considered shutting the plant down.

“If you were to buy the same amount of energy today, you could probably get it cheaper elsewhere,” he said.

Ultimately, the company kept the plant open. Line said it’s not too expensive to run and still generates a reliable flow of energy. Yet this back-and-forth on whether to keep hydro online isn’t uncommon.

A 2022 survey conducted by an engineering consulting firm found that about 36% of hydro operators in the U.S. were actively thinking about decommissioning their facilities.

Operators also noted they were “very concerned” about low energy prices, dam and public safety requirements that raise costs and the long, expensive process of renewing operating licenses.

Federal licensing

Unlike wind or solar projects, hydro facilities require a federal license that must be renewed every 30-50 years. Because water is a shared resource, plants often have to deal with dozens of federal, state, tribal and local authorities.

It can be a bureaucratic nightmare, according to Malcolm Woolf, the president of the National Hydropower Association. He said it takes eight years on average for a facility to relicense, and the process can sometimes drag on for more than a decade.

“Part of what makes the hydropower licensing so maddening, is that there’s no agency in control,” Woolf said. “If one of the dozens of agencies misses its statutory requirements, there’s nothing anyone else can do about it but wait.”

Woolf said licensing should be streamlined. He points out that there is no dispute resolution process if agencies impose different standards, causing projects to “languish.”

“And the requirements can be contradictory — have no more than 2 feet of water for this species. Have no less than 3 feet of water for this other species,” Woolf said. “It's like, well, we can't comply with both.”

The ""Big Beautiful Bill"" that recently passed Congress spared the hydro industry from losing out on tax credits, though a draft version in the U.S. House had initially put them on the chopping block.

In a written statement, Woolf described the legislation as a ""life-saver"" for the hydropower sector.

""The final version of the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' preserves the full value of the (Inflation Reduction Act) tax credits for hydropower and other water power technologies that begin construction by the end of 2033,"" he said. ""It also maintains elective pay provisions, allowing public power and cooperatives to leverage these credits ... ""

Hydro over the years

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates hydroelectric operations, does not keep track of historical license data, so it’s difficult to know exactly how many hydroelectric facilities have gone offline. In the last 15 years, Woolf said 68 facilities have voluntarily surrendered their licenses, though most of them were small-scale operations.

Most facilities were built in the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, and today the average age is 64 years old.

Caitlin Grady, a civil engineer and associate professor of engineering with the George Washington University, said the overall footprint has generally been stable.

Hydropower still accounts for around 6% of the nation’s electricity generation and supports roughly 25 million Americans.

While the hydro industry may not have the same ambitions for growth like wind and solar, Grady said it’s essential to national energy production, especially if we want to cut down on emissions.

“Without major changes in nuclear or hydro, we will not have a sustainable grid with just solar and wind unless we're also building a ton of batteries,” Grady said, “and I mean, tons and tons and tons of batteries.”

Hydro holds the coveted black start capability that allows operators to quickly restore power in the event of a grid shutdown, which Grady compares to flipping a switch on a fuse box.

“In the event of something happening, whether it’s related to climate change, or terrorists or cyber-hacks, anything, you have to have a way to turn [the grid] back on quickly,” she said.

And no one, Grady said, is pitching new hydro developments that require damming up rivers.

“When we originally built a bunch of dams in the early 1900s, we didn't care a lot about the environment or the people we were harming,” Grady said. “It was an era of building lots of infrastructure without thinking through the consequences.”

Instead, Grady said grid reliability and energy output could be expanded by adding turbines to existing dams or investing in modern pumped storage that uses water and gravity as a battery.

Standing the test of time

People have been using water as a source of power for at least 2,000 years, when water mills would crush grain and break ore. And century-old hydroelectric plants continue to churn out power.

The Keokuk Renewable Center, which sits on the Mississippi River, near Iowa, Illinois and Missouri, has been business as usual since 1913. Brad Todd, with Ameren Missouri, said there’s no plan to decommission Keokuk, which supplies electricity to around 75,000 homes a year.

“It's great for the customers, it's safe, it's efficient and Ameren plans on keeping ours around basically forever if we can,” Todd said.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/download_-_2025-07-07T103336.411.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png,N,,2025-07-08 14:22:00.127793

Over the last few months, DOE has already started issuing orders under the Federal Power Act section 202(c) that would extend the lives of polluting power plants past their planned expiration dates.

DOE plans to use this methodology to deem certain generators, likely coal and natural gas, as critical to system reliability, consistent with its recent actions.

Over the last few months, DOE has already started issuing orders under the Federal Power Act section 202(c) that would extend the lives of polluting power plants past their planned expiration dates. The orders falsely invoke emergency powers to upend the usual legal and regulatory decision-making process, requiring consumers to pay to operate plants that are not needed to meet reliability needs and that harm air quality and public health. DOE is now likely to renew these 202(c) orders and issue additional orders using the new methodology in order to continue preventing retirement of expensive, polluting power plants.

Coal, gas and oil fired power plants spew millions of pounds of health-harming and climate-warming pollution into the air each year, and cost consumers millions of dollars more than cleaner energy sources. Extending the lives of aging fossil fueled power plants usurps the judgment of state regulators, the utility, state Attorneys General, and numerous other parties who negotiate and approve the settlements to retire these plants.

Additionally, accreditation methods approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are typically developed by grid operators over months and even years of significant stakeholder input because these methods must take into account the different resource mixes, market constructs, and other conditions in a given region. DOE’s rushed one-size-fits-all approach - developed behind closed doors with no public input - is flawed and it could cost ratepayers an average of $2 billion or more every year without providing corresponding reliability benefits.

Recently, public interest groups challenged DOE’s illegal order to extend the J.H. Campbell power plant and Eddystone oil and gas power plant past their planned expiration dates.

Statement of Greg Wannier, Senior Attorney for the Sierra Club: “The methodology released today is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country’s energy future depends upon decades-old coal- and gas-plants, rather than clean renewables. The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump Administration is forcing on the country’s ratepayers. FERC and the states are already well equipped to meet any projected resource needs through the existing regulatory process, which ensures that electricity demand is reliably met at the least public cost. Any effort by DOE to override this process to forcibly keep coal plants online past their planned retirements would be an extraordinary and unlawful overreach of its regulatory authority. It would be particularly harmful and costly to the communities living near these power plants who face the possibility of continued exposure to toxic levels of air and water pollution. We will continue to hold the DOE accountable for any decisions it makes that have severe, direct consequences on everyday Americans.”

Statement of Christine Powell, Deputy Managing Attorney for Earthjustice’s Clean Energy program: “Determining the reserve margin and “critical” resources are complex decisions with severe health and economic consequences that Congress rightly entrusted FERC to oversee using a robust public adjudication process. Today’s methodology attempts to usurp that process, and would impose billions of dollars and harmful pollutants on consumers without any corresponding benefits for anyone except for the coal industry.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-08 11:11:57.240963

""The risk is, the people funding the NEVI program are also going to be making decisions on something so much larger than the NEVI program,"" Flynn said.
He noted that, since the Trump administration has appealed the ruling, none of the plaintiffs have received the disputed funds.
She noted that the Trump administration cited those funds as evidence it supported EV adoption even as it advocated scaling back purchase incentives for electric vehicles.
""We know that people who try to play nice with the Trump administration still get screwed,"" she said.","A disagreement between Democratic Attorney General Charity Clark and the administration of Republican Gov. Phil Scott has hindered legal efforts to unfreeze nearly $17 million in federal funding earmarked for public electric vehicle chargers.

Vermont was one of 17 states that sued the federal government in May, after the Trump administration halted distributions from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Last month, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin ordered the release of grant funds to 14 of those states, including California, New York, Illinois and Arizona.

But Vermont, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., won't get the money. Lin, who sits on a bench in Washington State, ruled that Vermont — unlike the successful states — had failed to submit evidence showing that it would face ""irreparable harm"" if the $16.7 million it was awaiting remained frozen.

Clark declined to say why her office didn't submit the necessary proof of harm, citing attorney-client confidentiality. She hinted, however, that it stemmed from a difference of opinion between her office and the Scott administration.

""I have every respect for my clients, the governor and the Agency of Transportation,"" Clark said. ""We're not always going to see eye to eye, but I know we all have the state's interests at heart.""

The reason the state didn't submit evidence of harm, such as a declaration from a public official, was largely because Transportation Secretary Joe Flynn told Clark before she filed the suit that he believed the state shouldn't get involved.

""My advice was, I did not think we should join because I thought it was premature,"" Flynn told Seven Days.

The Federal Highway Administration indicated in February that it would decide whether the funds would be released and, if so, would provide new guidelines for how the money could be spent, Flynn noted. The rules have yet to be issued.

There is a real risk the state could lose the grant funding, he acknowledged. But it seemed smarter to focus on ensuring the state receives its share of a larger upcoming round of federal highway funding than to fight over the smaller EV-charging dollars, he said. The state is gearing up to try to preserve the $1.7 billion it currently receives over five years in federal highway funds, he said.

""It was a conscious decision of how we were going to look at this, and the AG looked at it differently, and that is totally her prerogative,"" Flynn said.

Despite Flynn's position, Clark opted to join the suit. She said she was disappointed by the judge's June 25 decision but isn't giving up.

""We are certainly looking at our options to make sure we have the best case, and we are navigating the challenges that have been presented,"" Clark said.

Clark acknowledged that she and Scott's administration have ""taken a different approach to handling the illegal and unconstitutional actions made by the Trump administration.""

But she stressed that it is her responsibility to protect the state's interests in court.

""I will do everything I can to protect Vermont from federal overreach and protect Vermont from illegal withholding of federal funding that is supposed to be coming to Vermont,"" she said. ""If dollars were promised to Vermont and they are threatened, I will and I have worked to take proactive action. I'm not actually waiting for the withholding of the dollars.""

Clark has pursued dozens of legal actions against President Donald Trump since he took office in January. Vermont has joined 21 multistate lawsuits and filed ""friend of the court"" briefs in 40 others. The suits seek to block the federal government from such actions as conducting mass layoffs, sharing personal health data with ICE, imposing international tariffs and stripping education funds from states that support diversity programs.

The money at issue in the recent court decision is from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure initiative passed by Congress in 2021. Then-president Joe Biden hailed it as a way to speed the nation's transition from polluting gasoline-powered vehicles to clean energy. The program is intended to ensure that EV chargers are located at least every 50 miles along the nation's interstate highway corridors.

Environmental activists expressed disappointment over the court ruling and outrage upon learning that the Scott administration didn't cooperate.

""The Scott administration deliberately undermining the AG's attempt to get funds back from the Trump administration — for Vermonters — is beyond disappointing,"" said Ben Edgerly Walsh, climate and energy program director for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group.

Walsh noted that the state's latest Climate Action Plan relies heavily on a rapid transition to EVs. Meanwhile, he said, Scott has cited the lack of a robust charging network in Vermont as a justification for pausing other initiatives aimed at accelerating the shift to cleaner vehicles.

The idea that the state should wait for the new guidelines is dead wrong, Walsh said.

""If we're being honest, we have every reason to believe the Trump administration's intent is to sabotage, not implement, this program,"" he said.

Johanna Miller, energy and climate program director at the Vermont Natural Resources Council, called it ""unbelievable"" that the state might lose critical funding because administration officials don't see the harm in it.

""This appears to be yet another very expensive and shortsighted miscalculation from the Scott Administration. Fourteen other states can demonstrate irreparable harm but Vermont can't? We can!"" she wrote in an email.

Vermont has the most robust system of public chargers in the nation on a per capita basis, according to Dave Roberts, the coordinator at Drive Electric Vermont.

The state has 1,239 public charging ports, including 991 Level 2 chargers, which can juice up most EVs in several hours. Another 248 fast chargers can power most EV batteries to 80 percent in less than half an hour. That's 191 chargers per 100,000 people, a higher ratio than even California's, which has 147 public chargers per 100,000 people, Roberts said.

While most EV drivers plug in primarily at home, significant gaps remain in the network, including in rural areas and at many apartment buildings. Scott, a governor who enjoys appearing in far-flung corners of the state, has at times recounted challenges in charging his official electric Ford F-150 pickup.

The state was able to use $631,000 in federal EV infrastructure funds to build a fast-charging location that opened in Bradford last year, according to Patrick Murphy, a policy director with VTrans. Installation of fast-charging locations in Randolph and Wilmington were under contract when the freeze was announced. Those projects will move forward with state dollars, he said. Chargers that had been planned for 10 other communities are now on hold, he said.

That's not great, but that's hardly an ""irreparable harm,"" Flynn said. The state could choose to add more funding to the program next year, he noted.

After Judge Lin's ruling, Clark asked Flynn whether Agency of Transportation officials would be willing to make such a declaration of ""irreparable harm,"" but Flynn declined.

""How do we produce that?"" Flynn asked.

Others states had little trouble figuring it out. In court filings, Wisconsin showed that it was unable to move forward with 15 projects worth $7.3 million. Rhode Island described how the pause disrupted an application process to which public agencies had devoted significant time and money. Vermont provided no such testimony.

Flynn said his job is to make sure that his agency can fulfill all of its responsibilities to Vermonters and he didn't want to put the agency's ability to qualify for billions of federal dollars at risk.

""The risk is, the people funding the NEVI program are also going to be making decisions on something so much larger than the NEVI program,"" Flynn said.

He noted that, since the Trump administration has appealed the ruling, none of the plaintiffs have received the disputed funds. It's possible that when the new guidelines are issued, the matter will be moot, Flynn said.

Rep. Mollie Burke (D-Brattleboro), who sits on the Vermont House Transportation Committee, said the potential loss of the EV charging money is troubling. She noted that the Trump administration cited those funds as evidence it supported EV adoption even as it advocated scaling back purchase incentives for electric vehicles. She worries the setback will make Vermonters feel uncomfortable buying an EV and also make it less convenient for tourists to drive one to the state.

Burke also doubts that Scott's approach of ""trying to keep a very low profile"" in the face of Trump's various damaging actions will pay off for Vermonters.

Courts are being asked to rule on fundamental questions of responsibility, accountability, and justice in the face of accelerating climate harms. But as these legal efforts grow stronger, they are also drawing intensified resistance.

This year’s Global Trends in Climate Change Litigation: 2025 Snapshot from the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics provides a comprehensive look at how litigation has become both a global trend and a maturing tool for climate governance. The report tracks 2,967 climate-related legal cases filed to date across nearly 60 countries. In 2024 alone, at least 226 new climate cases were filed. More than 80% of them were considered strategic, which are cases designed not just to win individual relief, but to influence public policy, change corporate behavior, or clarify legal duties related to climate change.

Climate litigation cases filed globally and in the United States (1986–2024)

Perhaps most importantly, the report highlights a shift from courtroom victories to implementation. Increasingly, courts are issuing rulings that affirm the rights of people and obligations of states and companies. But just as courts are beginning to hold governments and corporations accountable, a coordinated political backlash is emerging to undermine this progress, discredit litigation efforts, and shield polluters from responsibility.

Key legal trends in climate litigation

The new report documents how courts around the world are advancing climate accountability by responding to a wave of strategic legal challenges. Three types of cases are reshaping expectations for governments, corporations, and financial institutions:

Challenges to national climate policies and adaptation failures

Governments are being sued for not doing enough. These cases include challenges to the adequacy of national climate frameworks and to failures to prepare for foreseeable climate impacts like sea level rise and extreme heat. Courts are being asked to enforce not just emissions targets, but also obligations to protect people and infrastructure from worsening climate risks.

Pressure on corporations and regulators to account for full emissions

Nearly 100 cases in 2024 targeted the lack of meaningful climate considerations in project approvals. These lawsuits increasingly focus on Scope 3 emissions, indirect emissions from downstream use of fossil fuels, which often exceed direct emissions and represent the majority of a project’s climate impacts.

In a landmark 2024 ruling, the United Kingdom Supreme Court found that downstream emissions from fossil fuel extraction are foreseeable and relevant, requiring them to be assessed during project approval. The Norwegian Supreme Court similarly suspended new oil field approvals until more robust climate reviews could be completed. In May 2025, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Court issued an advisory opinion affirming that Scope 3 emissions qualify as project-related effects under EU law. These cases mark a turning point: courts are now demanding rigorous, science-based justifications before high-emission projects move forward.

Accountability for both financial flows and past emissions

Litigation is extending to banks, pension funds, and insurers for failing to disclose climate-related risks or for breaching fiduciary duties by investing in fossil fuel infrastructure. At the same time, courts are increasingly open to the idea that companies may be held liable for their historic emissions. In Germany’s Lliuya v. RWE, the court reaffirmed that companies can face legal consequences for their proportional contributions to global climate harm.

Across these categories, legal reasoning is becoming more closely tied to scientific evidence. Courts are asking deeper questions about causation, accountability, and harm, demanding clearer data, and making decisions that reflect the realities of climate science.

Science is central and the need is growing

Science is essential at every stage of climate litigation. It informs how cases are built, how responsibility is assessed, and how remedies are designed. As climate litigation matures, so does the role of scientific evidence. In addition to understanding climate harms, courts are asking who is responsible, how risks can be quantified and what remedies are appropriate. Scientific research can help to inform these questions before the courts.

The Global Trends report points to a rising need for scientific evidence in areas like climate damages, fiduciary risk, and adaptation failures, particularly in cases where data is incomplete or standards are still emerging. As the focus shifts from landmark rulings to implementation and enforcement, science will remain a cornerstone for holding actors accountable and translating decisions into real-world outcomes. At its core, the role of science in climate litigation is to provide clarity, context, and rigor so that decisions are grounded in evidence.

US climate litigation faces legal and political attacks

While the global trends are clear, the situation in the United States is increasingly fraught. The report notes that the United States remains the country with the highest number of climate cases, with 164 new filings recorded in 2024 alone. Unlike many other countries, where federal governments are often the defendants, US litigation also features a growing number of cases in which communities, states, and individuals are challenging corporate actors directly. These include lawsuits brought by cities and states seeking damages for climate deception and harm caused by fossil fuel emissions.

However, the political environment around these cases is becoming increasingly hostile. At a recent Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing, a few members of Congress used their time to promote unsubstantiated claims aimed at discrediting climate litigation and those involved in it. These baseless accusations appear designed to distract from the real and growing legal exposure of fossil fuel companies

At the same hearing, Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach urged Congress to amend federal environmental law to block state and local climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies. His proposal would limit the ability of communities to pursue claims under well-established tort and consumer protection statues. It also challenges the authority of local and state governments to protect the health, safety, and economic security of their communities.

The stakes became even clearer with the release of a letter from sixteen Republican attorneys general to the Trump administration. The letter urges the administration to pursue legislation that would grant fossil fuel companies legal immunity from climate lawsuits. It also calls for the federal government to restrict funding to jurisdictions that bring such cases. If enacted, this would not only shield polluters from accountability, but punish communities for seeking justice. It is a direct attack on the principle of equal access to the courts and the foundational idea that the polluter should pay.

Where we go from here

Climate litigation is playing an increasingly important role in shaping how governments, companies, and financial institutions respond to climate change. These legal efforts bring scientific evidence into decision-making spaces, raise the profile of accountability, and have begun to influence both policy and practice.

But as recent pushback has illustrated, this moment is fragile. Right now the fossil fuel industry and its allies are working to rewrite the rules. Efforts to discredit litigation, limit access to the courts, or shield certain actors from liability threaten to slow progress and weaken long-standing legal principles.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Blog-Thumbnail-Justice-Scales-in-Forest.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 08:05:00.050400

What’s not yet clear is which changes to automakers’ production schedules will count against them in the eyes of the government.
In a media briefing in June, union officials suggested the government deny all tariff relief to companies that make permanent cuts to their Canadian operations.
As written, the tariff relief program is notably labour-friendly, said Andreas Schotter, a professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University, who studies trade policy and who previously worked at Volkswagen.
“The moment a Canadian production line underperforms, Detroit headquarters starts asking whether the next tranche of EV investment shouldn’t migrate to Tennessee instead,” he said.","Companies like Honda, Stellantis and General Motors that have delayed or cut production plans in Canada face a potential reckoning this week, as the federal government takes its first hard look at the numbers of its tariff relief program for automakers.

The process will test how Prime Minister Mark Carney and his government will respond to shift cuts and delayed product launches at Canadian auto factories announced this spring, after the Liberal government pledged to penalize carmakers that don’t maintain Canadian jobs.

How it works: Canada’s reciprocal tariff-relief program on motor vehicles, announced in April, applies to automakers that make vehicles in both Canada and the United States. Under it, Ottawa remits some of the tariffs paid on autos that those companies make in the U.S. but sell in Canada. The amount, though, will depend on how well those companies protect jobs in their Canadian operations.

The government assigned each of the five automakers who qualify—Ford, General Motors, Honda, Stellantis and Toyota—a quota of vehicles they can import duty-free from the U.S. for one year, ending April 8, 2026. If an automaker goes above the specified import levels, those vehicles will be tariffed, Finance Department spokesperson Audrey Milette said in a statement to The Logic.

Meanwhile, the quotas are contingent on automakers upholding their production plans. The government says it will reassess each automaker’s allotment every three months, with the first such examination due to take place this week.

Why would the allotments change? Honda has postponed its $15 billion expansion in Canada, GM has paused production at its Ingersoll, Ont., plant and cut a shift at its Oshawa, Ont., plant, while Stellantis has delayed plans to make the Dodge Charger EV model in Windsor, Ont. Ford’s Oakville, Ont., complex has been under renovation, with new trucks not expected to roll off production lines until late 2026.

What’s not yet clear is which changes to automakers’ production schedules will count against them in the eyes of the government.

Unifor, the union representing Canadian autoworkers, would like to see Ottawa respond to broken promises. In a media briefing in June, union officials suggested the government deny all tariff relief to companies that make permanent cuts to their Canadian operations.

As written, the tariff relief program is notably labour-friendly, said Andreas Schotter, a professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University, who studies trade policy and who previously worked at Volkswagen. By attaching a duty cost to each layoff, he said, the policy encourages automakers to invest in “retraining, shorter furloughs, even co-investing in automation that augments rather than replaces workers.”

How much will the government cut automakers’ current quota? Government officials and the automakers alike refused to reveal the current or future allotments to The Logic, citing competitive issues.

Toyota Canada spokesperson Michael Bouliane said the program is a “missed opportunity to support Canadian manufacturing.”

“While we appreciate that our government is fighting hard to protect the Canadian automotive industry, the current federal policy related to duty remission on automobile imports actually benefits net importers of vehicles into Canada more than it benefits our largest producers and exporters,” Bouliane wrote, applying the emphasis himself.

About half of the 1.7 million new vehicles Canadians bought in 2023 were imported from the U.S. Last year, the value of U.S. vehicle imports to Canada totalled about $35.6 billion.

Schotter shares a similar concern. By letting in a slew of tariff-free vehicles before hitting the quotas, the policy buys automakers time without compromising Canada’s leverage in its negotiations with the U.S., he said. But the program offers little to companies like Volkswagen, which invested in Canada with hopes to export electric-vehicle batteries to the U.S. The company’s $7 billion gigafactory investment in Canada doesn’t appear to qualify it for tariff relief, which applies only to companies that make fully assembled vehicles domestically.

What’s next: The government must decide whether it will penalize automakers in the name of protecting Canadian manufacturing jobs, or ease up on the industry as the trade war escalates.

While the tariff refunds give automakers breathing room to complete major projects, Schotter said, they don’t stop companies in the long term from cutting things like overtime for workers.

“The moment a Canadian production line underperforms, Detroit headquarters starts asking whether the next tranche of EV investment shouldn’t migrate to Tennessee instead,” he said. While the tariff relief system is “fast and accountable,” he added, “it risks turning a temporary customs tool into a long-term location gamble.”

David Adams, who leads the Global Automakers of Canada, which represents Toyota and Honda, said neither company has cut jobs in the country as a result of tariffs. Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association CEO Brian Kingston, whose group represents Ford, Stellantis and GM, said that the tariff-remission program should be temporary until a deal is reached with the U.S., which Carney hopes will happen by July 21.

“Everyone is working ahead on the assumption that we will get to some sort of agreement,” Kingston said. “The longer that these tariffs are in place, the more significant the impacts will be.”",https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Oshawa_GM_plant_Chevrolet_Silverado-Oshawa_Ontario-February_2022-P_Chris_Young-CP_151952985-1920x1280-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 14:21:44.100785

The DOE report looks backward at historical weather patterns.","A Department of Energy report issued Monday warns that the United States will lose the race for leadership in artificial intelligence technology unless it slams the brakes on plans to close older coal- and gas-fired power plants and speeds up construction of new ones.

To dramatize the challenge, DOE said that parts of the mid-Atlantic and Great Plains regions could face 400 hours of power outages in 2030 in a worst-case scenario where tech companies build giant energy-hungry AI data centers unabated, old coal plants keep closing and new power supplies come online slowly.

Hardest hit under this scenario, according to the DOE analysis, would be eastern states served by the PJM Interconnection grid. Weeks of power shortages in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia by 2030 would result from power plant closures and data center expansion. Under the most severe weather conditions based on history (not including future climate forecasts), power shortages in the area could total more than a month over the course of a year.

While the DOE scenarios are startling, the department noted that U.S. grid operators responsible for keeping the lights on would not approve data center growth that would “jeopardize the reliability of the system.”

Still, the DOE analysis sets the stage for emergency actions President Donald Trump has promised. That includes ordering coal- and gas-fired generators to cancel planned closures and to keep running. A nearly 90-year-old provision of the Federal Power Act, written for wartime use, gives him broad leeway to keep the plants open during national emergencies.

The DOE report declares Trump’s vow to win the AI race against China is such an emergency.

“Absent intervention, it is impossible for the nation’s bulk power system to meet the AI growth requirements while maintaining a reliable power grid and keeping energy costs low for our citizens,” said the report.

Presented as a technical analysis, the DOE report adopts Trump’s rebuke of former President Joe Biden’s goal of closing down coal power plants in favor of carbon-free wind and solar generation, which Trump recently called “windmills and the rest of this JUNK.”

“Caused by the harmful and shortsighted policies of the previous administration, our Nation’s inadequate energy supply and infrastructure causes and makes worse the high energy prices that devastate Americans, particularly those living on low- and fixed-incomes,” the report said.

Advanced Energy United, a group of clean technology developers and energy users, took issue with sweeping assertions that wind, solar and battery technology are a net-negative for the grid as opposed to energy assets during of period of rising electricity demand:

“The study released today by the Department of Energy appears to exaggerate the risk of blackouts and undervalue the contributions of entire resource classes, like wind, solar, and battery storage, despite the fact that regions like Texas that have enabled rapid growth of these technologies have been rewarded with lower costs and a more reliable grid,” said Caitlin Marquis, managing director at Advanced Energy United.

“[It’s] troubling that this final agency action will not be subject to public scrutiny before it’s used to justify retaining power plants that aren’t needed for reliability — a decision that would directly add costs to consumers bills,” Marquis added.

Jennifer Danis, federal energy policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law, questioned whether the analysis supports emergency declarations from the administration ordering aging coal and gas plants to halt their retirement plans.

“Reforms may be needed to ensure better planning for future resource adequacy to power AI,” Danis said in a statement, “but they should focus on improving existing markets and planning standards, as well as speeding up new resource interconnection, rather than forcing customers to pay to keep old, inefficient plants online.”

Biden’s energy agenda — an unprecedented campaign to combat the threat of climate change fueled by the burning of coal, natural gas and oil for electricity — was only partially realized when Trump’s victory last November signed death warrants for much of the plan. The DOE report does not mention climate change.

‘AI is going to change our world’

A consensus of grid operators in U.S. competitive power markets like PJM and the Southwest Power Pool is that grid reliability faces extraordinary stresses if the heavy rate of fossil plant retirements continues. Coal-fired plants, which supplied half of U.S. electricity two decades ago, have shrunk to just a 16 percent share, trailing natural gas plants, nuclear reactors, and just ahead of wind and solar power.

The conclusion of power industry leaders at a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission conference last month was “keep what we have” until the dimensions of the AI boom are clear and the pace of new plant construction can finally pick up.

“AI is going to change our world,” said Manu Asthana, the PJM CEO, told the FERC conference. “In our forecast between 2024 and 2030, currently we have a 32-gigawatt increase in demand, of which 30 is from data centers,” Asthana said. PJM must “find that intersection between reliability and affordability that works both for consumers and suppliers, and that intersection is getting harder and harder to find.”

Clean energy advocates fault PJM for an overly costly, complex process for approving new solar and wind projects in the region over nearly a decade.

“As if this wasn’t challenging enough,” said Lanny Nickell, CEO of the Southwest Power Pool, “we are now projecting our peak demand to be as much as 75 percent higher 10 years from now, and that’s largely driven by electrification and data center growth.”

DOE reported that 104 GW of fossil fuel plant capacity is expected to retire by 2030. (One GW of power output—1,000 megawatts—supports about 850,000 average U.S. homes, with wide regional differences.)

“This capacity is not being replaced on a one-to-one basis and losing this generation could lead to significant outages when weather conditions do not accommodate wind and solar generation,” DOE said.

The supply-demand balance gets much worse with DOE’s assumption that at least 50 GW of new around-the-clock plant capacity will be needed to power data centers between now and 2030.

The DOE report looks backward at historical weather patterns. That runs contrary to the warnings of grid officials at last month’s FERC conference, urging regulators and the power industry to look ahead to worsening assaults of extreme weather fueled by climate change.

While these scenarios underscore the need for harder, weather-protected energy infrastructure, they highlight the power system’s dependence on just-in-time natural gas supply that can also be threatened in severe winters, officials said.

Jim Robb, CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the high-voltage grid’s security monitor, told last month’s conference that weather models need improvements. “We also need to have a much better understanding of natural gas, particularly in winter.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/1b/ad/49d6c18049928329d2a7e3dabea7/house-energy-98671.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 07:12:00.243185

The Report on Evaluating US Grid Reliability and Security fulfils Section 3(b) of President Trump’s Executive Order, described as “strengthening the reliability and security of the United States’ electric grid”.

The report presents a consistent methodology for identifying regions at risk and guiding federal reliability interventions, tackling the issue of grid reliability amid changing energy demands.

The analysis indicates that permitting the retirement of 104GW of firm generation by 2030, without timely replacements, could result in substantial outages during periods when weather conditions are unfavourable for wind and solar generation.

Modelling suggests that annual outage hours could rise from the current single digits to more than 800 hours per year, putting millions of households and businesses at risk.

This situation poses a significant threat to the country’s energy security, particularly as electricity demand rises from AI-driven data centres and advanced manufacturing.

Secretary Chris Wright stated: “This report affirms what we already know: the United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.

“In the coming years, America’s reindustrialisation and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable and uninterrupted power. President Trump’s administration is committed to advancing a strategy of energy addition, and supporting all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable and secure. If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.”

The 104GW of plant retirements are set to be replaced by 209GW of new generation by 2030; however, only 22GW will come from firm baseload generation sources.

Even in the absence of retirements, the model indicated that the risk of outages in several regions increases more than 30-fold, highlighting that the existing queue is insufficient to address the deficit in dependable capacity.

The report recommends the use of modern methods to evaluate resource adequacy rather than traditional peak-hour tests, while taking into account the frequency, magnitude and duration of power outages.

In early July 2025, the DoE issued an emergency order to prevent blackouts in the southeastern US.

But privatising climate risks may backfire as people may resent bearing the costs of the collective failure to address the climate crisis.
First, privatising climate risk may make it difficult for a large majority of Americans to gain or retain home ownership.
Second, privatising responses to climate risks—either through policy or the uncoordinated actions of individuals and households—may also affect public responses to climate-related disasters.
The scale of the climate crisis upends the long-established principles of risk pooling that are central to the insurance market.","Dramatic scenes of wildfires around Los Angeles, with entire neighborhoods burned to the ground, dominated global media for weeks earlier this year.

In the immediate aftermath of the fires, the hotel industry, automakers, national and multinational corporations, and state agencies announced support for the affected communities.

Yet, now that media attention has faded, the affected homeowners are stuck in a “Ring Around the Rosie game of bureaucracy” between insurance companies, state agencies, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

The tendency among various agencies and actors to pass the buck is a symptom of the failure to reassess the relationship between public and private responses to the climate crisis. The author’s recently published book shows how the climate crisis demands a rethinking of the fundamental precepts of modernity, including the larger-than-life role played by private property and capitalism.

As another potentially devastating fire season looms over the US west and across the world, lessons from LA—where local, state, and federal policymakers got it wrong—can help improve responses to climate-related disasters.

Climate change has upended housing insurance markets in California, nationally, and globally. Most policy solutions aim to steer individuals toward incorporating climate risks in home purchasing and ownership decisions — developments that privatise the risks of climate change.

For example, some state laws in the US require disclosing a home’s flood history or wildfire risks to potential buyers or making insurance policies conditional on homeowners taking specific risk reduction measures, such as raising a home’s mechanical systems above the base flood elevation, creating five-foot ember-resistant zones around homes or clearing fire-fueling vegetation from around a house.

Embedded in such policies is the argument that internalising the risks related to climate change impacts will incentivise buyers and owners to support measures for addressing the climate crisis. Thus, the Federal National Mortgage Association (also known as Fannie Mae), which backs more than 40 percent of all residential mortgages in the US, seeks to incorporate climate change risk into its mortgage underwriting.

But privatising climate risks may backfire as people may resent bearing the costs of the collective failure to address the climate crisis. And privatising these risks spells trouble for public entities.

First, privatising climate risk may make it difficult for a large majority of Americans to gain or retain home ownership. Some analysts suggest that one in ten properties insured by the US’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) will eventually require a rate hike of at least 300 percent. Flood insurance in the worst-affected areas in Florida and Louisiana could increase so dramatically for some properties that they “effectively become worthless“.

Second, privatising responses to climate risks—either through policy or the uncoordinated actions of individuals and households—may also affect public responses to climate-related disasters. In the wake of the LA fires, the wealthiest households hired concierge firefighting services to protect their properties while the rapidly moving wildfires scorched entire neighborhoods around them.

Such measures can interfere with public responses to wildfires, as these private responses are often not part of the streamlined chain of command between state, county, and local firefighters.

Third, privatising risk is unlikely to address the systemic effects of the climate crisis. For example, one of the most important, and often neglected, questions is the role that property taxes play in the provision of services by local governments.

Raising alarm over wildfire or flood-related risks could bring down property prices and, in turn, reduce property taxes, which local governments rely on for providing public education, firefighting, and other vital services. At the same time, the worsening climate crisis imposes new costs on local governments.

Despite support from state and federal agencies, local governments are left to bear significant portions of post-disaster costs, including cleaning up and rebuilding public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, power lines, streetlights, and sewage systems. An early estimate suggested that wildfires in Pacific Palisades and parts of Los Angeles in January 2025 damaged or destroyed about US$350 million in public infrastructure. This estimate did not include the damage from the Eaton fire, which burned in Altadena and Pasadena.

As a result of these pressures, privatisation of climate risks presents formidable challenges that local governments cannot resolve on their own. Private insurers, whose business model gave rise to the controversial concierge firefighting services, cannot address these problems on their own.

The scale of the climate crisis upends the long-established principles of risk pooling that are central to the insurance market. Random distribution of risks across space, time, and policyholders is crucial for the viability of insurance providers’ business models and keeping insurance premiums affordable. A significant spike in the frequency and scope of climate change-related disasters, such as wildfires, goes against the assumption of risk pooling, making the worst-affected states or regions uninsurable.

The need to address these gaps has become more salient in the context of the proposals for “managed retreat” from areas that the climate crisis is likely to render uninhabitable.

Long-term solutions to these challenges require a fundamental restructuring of the state, society, and the economy, such as reducing the dependence of local governments on property taxes. These increasingly unavoidable transformative changes can be realized only under a broad-based public mandate for managing risks and protecting the most vulnerable groups.

Public deliberations about the links between private interests and public policies and institutions will be crucial for adapting to a climate-changed world.

The top performers in the ETI are mainly the Nordic countries, while Latvia and the UAE stand out for their notable year-on-year enhancements.

Well-funded, effective strategies, guided by global goals yet customized per country, emerge as the way forward, backed by global cooperation that yields tangible results.

Momentum for the energy transition has recorded its strongest improvement since 2021, which marked the beginning of the energy crisis.

The 2025 Energy Transition Index (ETI) recorded a 1.1% year-on-year increase in global scores – over twice the average pace of the past three years. The ETI framework evaluates 118 countries across three system performance dimensions—security, equity, and sustainability—and five enabling dimensions that reflect transition readiness.

Clean energy is now a crucial engine for economic growth, attracting more than $2 trillion in 2024 – double the 2020 levels – and supporting over 16 million jobs.

Even so, the report also finds that investments are still below the $5.6 trillion that is needed annually through 2030, including $2.2 trillion in emerging markets alone, to align with a net-zero pathway. Progress across the world is also uneven, with varying speeds and approaches taken by different countries.

While there may be many paths to net zero, the report highlights that knowledge sharing is one of the biggest priorities for accelerating the energy transition at a time of geopolitical tensions, economic volatility and supply chain disruptions.

With this in mind, what can we learn from the Index’s top performers and fastest risers?

The top five: the Nordics continue to lead the global energy transition

The top ETI performers have maintained a relatively stable performance since 2024, led by European countries, which have emerged as the global spearheads of decarbonization. The Nordic countries were firmly at the forefront of Europe's energy transition: Sweden (ETI 77.5), Finland (71.8), Denmark (71.6) and Norway (71.5). Switzerland (71.0) followed in fifth place.

The top performers share five common enablers. They have a highly diversified clean energy mix, with a large percentage of renewable and nuclear energy compared to fossil fuels. For example, renewables make up 83% in Switzerland and 80% in Sweden.

Adding to this, governments are providing long-term certainty through clear climate targets and supporting policies for both low-carbon electricity and energy efficiency. They are also upgrading and expanding grids to accommodate renewables and decentralized energy generation.

Green industrial policies in the ETI's leading markets aim to generate public and private investments into scaling technologies such as hydrogen, energy storage and smart grids to decarbonize energy production and usage. A case in point: Sweden has the highest number of heat pumps per capita in the world and is one of the first countries to establish a green steel production facility.

Finally, the top performers have succeeded in maintaining public support by backing up environmental taxes with fair access to green energy and strong welfare systems to cushion the impact of the energy transition, the ETI 2025 report finds.

However, despite stable performances from the stalwarts of the energy transition, the greatest momentum is building elsewhere in the world.

The fastest risers: setting the pace for the world

Latvia (69.4)

With a year-on-year change of 7.9%, Latvia entered the ETI top ten for the first time this year. Its score was supported by gains in equitable access to energy as well as new investments. Major contributors to this were a 59% drop in electricity prices and a growing share of renewables in its energy mix, enabling greater energy independence and underscoring the impact of the country’s focused policies.

While its significant share of hydroelectric in the energy mix has come down slightly, along with fossil fuels, Latvia has benefitted from growth in renewable sources such as wind, solar and bioenergy, Irena reports.

United Arab Emirates (58.4)

With a 7.85% year-on-year score change, the UAE recorded the highest improvement across the Middle East, thanks to accelerated investments in the country’s buildout of renewable capacity. The majority of the energy produced is from natural gas and oil. However, the UAE has been investing in its high solar potential since 2014, and most of the capacity added in recent years has been solar power.

The ETI report also attributes the UAE’s progress to targeted subsidy reforms and greater energy efficiency, underscoring how focused policies can help speed decarbonization.

China (67.5)

In 12th place globally on the ETI, China remains a key player in the energy transition. With a 2.2 percentage point increase, China led the emerging Asia region, also delivering the fifth-highest transition readiness score globally. The ETI report attributes China’s continued leadership in renewable energy to its well-developed innovation ecosystems and financial strength.

In May 2025, Carbon Brief reported that CO2 emissions had been stable or decreasing for over a year, despite growing power demand. Fast growth in renewable power generation has overtaken average demand growth, cutting the use of fossil fuels. Renewables now make up 50% of China’s energy mix.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

Fragmentation demands greater collaboration

Learning from the experiences of these trailblazing economies will be vital for accelerating the transition in other markets. Effective, well-funded strategies, guided by global goals but tailored to each country’s circumstances and resources, emerge as the path forward. This includes updating infrastructure to better accommodate renewables, developing a transition-ready workforce, and fostering energy innovation.

Achieving these goals cannot just rely on single-market initiatives, the ETI report concludes, but a new type of global and regional alliances needs to be forged. Cooperation must now shift from broader strategic alliances to delivery-focused initiatives that can achieve tangible results for speeding the transition to a more sustainable, equitable and secure energy future.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/Hkjmcb7oLlo5zw_bMUgKF7VpXDcDbQzUTpLSTCfA0Zc.PNG,N,,2025-07-08 07:11:39.332071

Several leadership posts for weather service in Texas are vacant, including roles that often serve as middlemen between NWS meteorologists and local authorities ahead of weather emergencies, Chelsea reported.
But as her story notes, “accurate weather forecasts alone aren’t enough to save lives” — a reality that the U.S. has experienced time and again in recent decades.
“The forecasts went out, they communicated the forecasts, they disseminated the watches and warnings.
Placing the staffers on leave was “an act of blatant political retaliation,” said Nicole Cantello, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents Region 5 employees.","Some Texas officials were quick to point fingers at the National Weather Service after devastating floods took the lives of more than 90 people, including dozens of children at a sleepover camp on the Guadalupe River.

But the agency issued accurate forecasts ahead of Friday’s deluge, escalating its warnings as far as 12 hours before the flooding hit, writes Chelsea Harvey.

It will take experts time to piece together why those warnings failed to marshal a state and local response before it was too late. But today, the weather service’s forecasters gained a perhaps unlikely ally: the Trump administration, which has spent the past few months trying to shrink the agency and its funding.

“The National Weather Service did its job,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, adding that the agency had extra staff on duty at the time of the storm. “So to any person who has deliberately lied about these facts surrounding this catastrophic event, you should be deeply ashamed.”

Leavitt’s comments — aimed at Democrats and “some members of the media” — belie President Donald Trump’s long-running criticism of the weather service and its parent agency, NOAA.

During his first term, Trump undermined forecasts for 2019’s Hurricane Dorian by displaying a NOAA map doctored with a Sharpie marker to back up his inaccurate claims that the storm would hit Alabama.

When a local weather service office issued a rare correction of the president’s assertions to quell public confusion, then-acting NOAA chief Neil Jacobs criticized the local forecasters. Trump is now nominating Jacobs to lead NOAA, this time permanently.

Since retaking office, Trump has targeted NOAA’s research on climate science, and his administration has begun to carry out a proposal to downsize the agency and disband its climate programs, very much like what Project 2025 had called for.

As the height of hurricane season looms, NOAA — led by a Trump appointee who took over as acting administrator in April — has lost or forced out more than 600 weather service employees, slashed grants and programs, shuttered climate education and proposed to cut $2.2 billion of agency funding as part of the administration’s larger effort to downsize the federal government.

It’s not clear how much, if at all, those changes contributed to the emergency response in Texas last week. Several leadership posts for weather service in Texas are vacant, including roles that often serve as middlemen between NWS meteorologists and local authorities ahead of weather emergencies, Chelsea reported.

But as her story notes, “accurate weather forecasts alone aren’t enough to save lives” — a reality that the U.S. has experienced time and again in recent decades.

The late night and early morning alerts that went out last week may have simply failed to reach communities due to the hour or because people often disable emergency alerts on their cellphones. Local government resources were lacking as well — as The New York Times reported Sunday, officials in rural Kerr County, Texas, had rejected a proposed early-flood-warning system in 2017 as too expensive.

“The crux of this disaster is a failure of the last mile of communication,” Tom Fahy, legislative director at the union that represents NWS, told Chelsea. “The forecasts went out, they communicated the forecasts, they disseminated the watches and warnings. And the dilemma we have is there was nobody listening at 4 o’clock in the morning.”

FEMA and Trump

The White House on Monday did an about-face on the question of whether to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Irie Sentner reports.

Comments from press secretary Leavitt come after floods ravaging Texas claimed the lives of more than 90 people, including more than two dozen children.

“The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” Leavitt said when asked if Trump was reconsidering his proposals to wind down the agency. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”

Trump has criticized FEMA’s handling of catastrophes in North Carolina and elsewhere, and on the campaign trail falsely claimed money for disaster aid was being funneled into housing undocumented immigrants.

EPA puts dissenters on leave

The Environmental Protection Agency last week placed 139 employees on administrative leave for signing onto an open letter criticizing the Trump administration’s policies on climate change and science. The targeting of dissenters has sparked a backlash among EPA union employees and on Capitol Hill, Kevin Bogardus reports.

Placing the staffers on leave was “an act of blatant political retaliation,” said Nicole Cantello, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents Region 5 employees. She added that “EPA employees have the right to freedom of speech just like everyone else.”

The agency has stressed its employees have other means to provide feedback other than the open letter, which they argue was a misuse of taxpayer funds and misled the public.

NEPA headache for courts

A recent 8-0 ruling of the Supreme Court that limits federal environmental reviews to pollution directly tied to an infrastructure project could help agencies defend their analyses. But legal experts are split on how much the decision will shift rulings in the lower courts, Niina H. Farah writes.

The ruling this term was an unusual example of the Supreme Court weighing in on the National Environmental Policy Act. Critics of NEPA argue federal judges have wrongly interpreted the landmark law to require more and more analysis — and in the process, critical projects are bedeviled by rising costs and delays.

Upholding the 2035 zero-emission target, supported by strategic policies, could secure economic stability, create jobs, and position the EU as a leader in the global EV market.","A new study reveals that upholding the European Union’s 2035 zero-emission car target could safeguard 1 million auto industry jobs and drive significant growth in electric vehicle (EV) production. Published by Transport & Environment (T&E), the report underscores the critical role of supportive policies in maintaining Europe’s competitive edge in the global EV market amidst challenges like U.S. tariffs and Chinese advancements.

Economic Stakes for Europe’s Auto Sector

The EU’s 2035 mandate requires all new cars and vans sold to emit zero carbon dioxide, effectively phasing out fossil-fuel vehicles. T&E’s study projects that adhering to this goal, paired with robust industrial strategies, could restore Europe’s car production to 16.8 million vehicles annually—matching its post-2008 crisis peak. This would increase the automotive value chain’s economic contribution by 11% by 2035, equivalent to billions in added revenue.

However, abandoning the target could devastate the industry. T&E warns of a potential loss of 1 million jobs and a $105.5 billion (90 billion euros) reduction in the sector’s economic value by 2035. Additionally, two-thirds of planned battery investments could vanish, weakening Europe’s position in the global EV supply chain.

Job Creation in Battery and Charging Sectors

The transition to EVs offers significant opportunities for job growth. T&E estimates that by 2030, battery manufacturing could generate over 100,000 new jobs, with an additional 120,000 jobs in charging infrastructure by 2035. These gains could offset job displacement in traditional vehicle manufacturing, ensuring a smoother shift to electrification.

“It’s a make or break moment for Europe’s automotive industry as the global competition to lead the production of electric cars, batteries, and chargers is immense,” said Julia Poliscanova, Senior Director for Vehicles & Emobility Supply Chains at T&E, reports The Times.

Global Competition and Policy Challenges

European carmakers face mounting pressures, including high domestic production costs and a technological gap with Chinese and U.S. competitors. Recent U.S. tariffs, imposing a 25% levy on auto imports under President Donald Trump, have forced many manufacturers to retract their 2025 forecasts. Despite lobbying to soften CO2 emissions targets, the European Parliament has upheld the 2035 ban on fossil-fuel car sales, though some interim targets were relaxed in May 2025.

To stay competitive, T&E urges the EU to implement policies that bolster domestic EV and battery production, such as incentives for local manufacturing and investment in charging networks. Without these, Europe risks ceding ground to rivals who are rapidly scaling their EV ecosystems.

Implications for EV Owners and Industry

For EV owners and enthusiasts, a strong EU commitment to the 2035 target could accelerate the availability of affordable, high-quality electric vehicles and expand charging infrastructure across the continent. A thriving domestic battery industry would also reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, potentially lowering costs for consumers. Conversely, weakening the mandate could slow EV adoption, limit model options, and hinder the development of a robust charging network, impacting both recreational and professional EV users.

The stakes are high for Europe’s auto industry and its EV future. Upholding the 2035 zero-emission target, supported by strategic policies, could secure economic stability, create jobs, and position the EU as a leader in the global EV market. Failure to act, however, risks significant losses and a diminished role in the electrification revolution.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8069-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:32:41.957066

New solar and wind projects were left with two limited options to get tax credits.
So even if some projects aren’t financially viable now without the tax credits, they soon could be.

In many parts of the country, they’re the cheapest source of new power even without the tax credits.","A proposed solar farm in New Mexico aims to finish construction by 2029 or 2030. But the developer that hopes to build it now plans to buy solar panels for the project early—so it could potentially beat the government’s new deadline to qualify for federal tax credits.

The new budget law signed by President Trump on July 4 slashed incentives for clean power. New solar and wind projects were left with two limited options to get tax credits. First, a new project can qualify if it starts generating power by the end of 2027. That’s a tiny window of time for projects that typically take several years to permit and build. The law also offers a “safe harbor” option: if you start building a new wind or solar farm within the next 12 months, you have another four years to finish.

“While we’re not thrilled with this legislation—to say the least—we’re going to just respond to the circumstances,” says Jim Spencer, president and CEO of Exus Renewables North America, a wind and solar developer. “What that means, of course, is grandfathering as many projects as possible.”

In New Mexico, Exus has multiple proposals under consideration for new solar farms; by buying solar panels early, the company will be ready to move forward quickly when it wins a bid.

Developers can take a few other steps to accelerate projects. If they still need approval from a local community, for example, they might offer extra incentives like more funding for schools or roads. If the regional grid has limited capacity to add energy on local transmission lines, the developer could decide to add more battery storage to ease demand and help it get approval. In some cases, developers might be able to work directly with a customer like a data center and build a microgrid that avoids the need to connect to the grid at all.

Right now, the slowest part of building any new wind or solar farm is the interconnection queue, where grid operators analyze and approve energy projects. There are currently more than 10,000 renewable projects in the queue, according to Interconnection.fyi. Getting approval can take years.

Technology could also potentially help. PJM, the regional grid that covers an area ranging from parts of Illinois to Tennessee, recently announced that it was working with Google and Tapestry, an Alphabet project, to use AI to review interconnection requests more quickly. And “grid-enhancing technologies” can make it possible for transmission lines to handle more power, removing another bottleneck.

Permitting is another challenge, but states could change policy to help speed that up. First, some outdated types of permits could potentially be eliminated for clean energy. “Applying conventional energy permitting requirements for a coal plant to a solar project is apples to oranges,” says Harry Godfrey, who leads the federal policy team at Advanced Energy United, an industry group.

States could also move to a checklist approach, where developers are responsible for doing their own assessments and validating them. In Texas, where permitting requirements are streamlined, “we see real differences in terms of speed and scale of project development compared to the vast majority of the rest of the country,” Godfrey says.

States could also make it easier to site projects. Local communities should be able to make some decisions about whether projects should get built, says Evan Vaughan, executive director at the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition (MAREC) Action, a group of renewable developers and manufacturers. But he argues that also has to be balanced with the energy demand in a region.

PJM has said that its peak demand could rise by a staggering 70 gigawatts—enough to power around 52 million homes—over the next decade. “That’s an almost inconceivable amount of energy,” Vaughan says. “The more of these near-term projects that don’t reach fruition, not only does it mean it’s harder to meet that goal, but it’s also going to come at a higher expense.”

For utilities, there’s an incentive to help get as many projects built now as possible. “I think that they all realize that the sooner that they can contract and avail themselves projects with tax credits the cheaper their electricity is going to be,” says Spencer.

But it’s not clear how quickly states or grid operators could make the changes to help more projects get built soon enough to use the tax credits. In many areas, state action would be politically difficult; a growing number of counties across the country have restricted or even banned new renewable projects. Some projects that are at an early stage now likely won’t get built. An analysis from Jesse Jenkins, who leads Princeton’s Zero-carbon Energy systems Research and Optimization (ZERO) Lab, found that future projects without the credits could cost 50% more.

If the supply of projects in the pipeline shrinks while demand continues to quickly grow, the price of energy will go up. So even if some projects aren’t financially viable now without the tax credits, they soon could be. “That’s because we’ll all be paying more for power,” Godfrey says. “That’s one of the fundamental ironies of this bill. It’s intended to make life more affordable, but the result is it makes it more expensive.”

The industry also faces a risk that the administration may go farther. Trump reportedly promised Republicans in Congress that he’d find ways to stop all projects from getting tax credits, despite what the new law says. But because of the growth in demand for energy, and the fact that large customers like data centers prefer renewables, wind and solar could still continue to grow. In many parts of the country, they’re the cheapest source of new power even without the tax credits.

Meanwhile, developers like Exus will continue racing forward. “I think for the next couple of years, we’re all going to be very, very busy,” says Spencer. “Because we’re going to be building everything that we can.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91364075-wind-and-solar-credit-race.jpg",N,,2025-07-08 07:12:31.272559

The government hopes that the 10-year Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan, developed in collaboration with industry, trade unions and workers, will create thousands of new jobs.

The boost to investment comes hot on the heels of the programme of investment in homegrown energy announced in last month’s Spending Review, including funding to build Sizewell C nuclear power station and £9.4 billion allocated to carbon capture industries. This is in addition to the £40 billion of private investment in clean energy announced in the past year.

Highlights of the plan include:

£700 million allocated to Great British Energy (GBE) to invest in domestic manufacturing facilities for clean power technologies, including floating offshore platforms, electric cables and hydrogen infrastructure. This builds on the £300 million initial investment by GBE in offshore wind supply chains;

The CfD Clean Industry Bonus, the financial reward scheme for offshore wind developers investing in homegrown, cleaner supply chains, may be expanded to other sectors including hydrogen and onshore wind;

The British Business Bank’s £4 billion Industrial Strategy Growth Capital will support climate tech companies seeking to scale up by leveraging greater venture capital fund investments, enhanced direct investment programmes and a greater focus on large strategic investments in deep tech sectors;

The National Wealth Fund will commit at least £5.8 billion over this Parliament to ports, hydrogen, carbon capture, gigafactories, and green steel;

Investment of over £2.5 billion over five years in R&D for fusion energy, including progressing the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Product (STEP) programme which aims to deliver a prototype fusion power plant in the East Midlands by 2040;

Establishing the UK’s first regional hydrogen network from 2031 which will facilitate the production, storage and transportation of low-carbon hydrogen to support its use in key sectors locally, with £500 million in Government support;

Lucy Yu, CEO and founder of the Centre for Net Zero, was named the Government’s Clean Energy AI Champion, helping to drive the adoption of AI across the UK’s clean energy sector.

Will the National Grid receive investment?

Ofgem also announced an ambitious funding programme on 1 July, dedicating £8.9 billion to power the biggest expansion of the electricity grid since the 1960s. According to Ofgem, the funding marks the first step in an estimated £80 billion investment programme which will boost grid capacity and therefore shelter households from dramatic fluctuations in energy bills caused by volatile international gas markets.

The funding will allow for 80 transmission projects and associated works to be completed within five years. Limited grid capacity and creaky infrastructure has been a huge barrier to the adoption of renewable energy technology – Ofgem states that the funding will allow up to 126 GW of clean power generation to be connected to the grid by 2030.

Another £15 billion will go towards the continued safe operation of Great Britain’s gas transmission and distribution networks.

The incident spurred questions about the preparedness of federal agencies such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and others like it as they face the administration’s crosshairs.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which houses NWS, lost hundreds of staffers to Trump administration cuts, and positions within the Weather Service were among them.
“The Weather Service did a really good job, actually, in getting watches and warnings and …wireless emergency alerts out,” he told The Hill on Monday.
“In the weather forecast offices, the one who follows up with that is the position called the warning coordination meteorologist.","The deadly Texas floods are drawing renewed scrutiny to Trump administration cuts at the nation’s weather and climate research agencies.

A flash flood on Friday unleashed water from the Guadalupe River in Central Texas, killing at least 90 people as of Monday afternoon.

The incident spurred questions about the preparedness of federal agencies such as the National Weather Service (NWS) and others like it as they face the administration’s crosshairs.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which houses NWS, lost hundreds of staffers to Trump administration cuts, and positions within the Weather Service were among them.

The Austin/San Antonio Weather Service office’s warning coordination meteorologist, who organizes alerting the outside world about agency forecasts, took a Trump administration buyout in April. The office’s Science Operations Officer, who implements new technology and data, also retired around the same time.

Rick Spinrad, who led the NOAA during the Biden administration, said that the office’s forecasters still did well, but that staffing-related issues could be causing communication problems.

“I do think the cuts are contributing to the inability of emergency managers to respond,” Spinrad said.

“The Weather Service did a really good job, actually, in getting watches and warnings and …wireless emergency alerts out,” he told The Hill on Monday. “It’s really a little early to give a specific analysis of where things might have broken down, but from what I’ve seen, it seems like the communications breakdown in the last mile is where most of the problem was.”

He particularly pointed to the absence of a warning coordination meteorologist.

“Information went out with significant lead time of several hours, and yet no action was taken,” Spinrad said.

“When you send a message, there’s no guarantee that it’s received, so someone needs to follow up,” he said. “In the weather forecast offices, the one who follows up with that is the position called the warning coordination meteorologist. And guess what, there is no WCM in the San Antonio/Austin weather forecast office, because that’s one of the positions that was lost in the cuts from this administration.”

The Austin/San Antonio Weather Service office issued a flood watch on Thursday afternoon, saying that areas could get up to 5 to 7 inches of rainfall.

That night, at about 1 a.m. local time Friday, it posted on X that parts of the state were seeing a flash flood warning. Just after 3 a.m., it posted that “a very dangerous flash flooding event is ongoing.”

“Heavy rainfall continues in this area and a Flash Flood Warning is in effect. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!” the Weather Service said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called for an investigation into “the scope, breadth, and ramifications of whether staffing shortages at key local National Weather Service (NWS) stations contributed to the catastrophic loss of life and property during the deadly flooding.”

President Trump said staffing cuts didn’t impact its handling of the incident.

“That was really the Biden setup…but I wouldn’t blame Biden for it, either,” he said. “This is a hundred-year catastrophe and it’s just so horrible to watch.”

Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson for the NWS, said the Austin/San Antonio office as well as the San Angelo office “had additional forecasters on duty during the catastrophic flooding event in Texas’s Hill Country during the July 4 holiday weekend” in an email to The Hill.

“Extra staff members from both offices, in addition to the West Gulf River Forecast Center, had extra personnel on the night of Thursday, July 3 into the day on Friday, July 4. All forecasts and warnings were issued in a timely manner,” she said. “Additionally, these offices were able to provide decision support services to local partners, including those in the emergency management community. The NWS remains dedicated to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services.”

It is not the first time the administration’s buyouts and other mass firings have come under scrutiny. Earlier this year, the National Nuclear Security Administration rehired staff that oversees the nation’s nuclear weapons after firing them en masse.

Following staffing cuts, the Weather Service indicated that it was looking to shuffle or hire employees to fill positions in some “critically understaffed” offices, though the Austin/San Antonio and San Angelo ones were not among them.

Tom Di Liberto, a former NOAA climate scientist and public affairs specialist, told The Hill he believes that even with the staffing cuts, the administration should still be able to get the forecast out.

However, he warned that other functions that help NWS do its job such as building relationships could be diminished by the cuts.

“My big concern is, when it comes to the staffing shortages and the loss of expertise, that we’ve lost, not only their knowledge…knowledge of their regions — what areas flood, what areas are most of concern — but we also lost the relationships with existing partners and external partners,” Di Liberto said.

Staffing cuts are not the only potential headwind coming for the nation’s meteorologists. In its proposed budget, the Trump administration is calling for broader cuts to research.

This includes eliminating NOAA’s Office of Atmospheric Research and reducing the budget for the agency’s weather research program

It also includes closing the Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Oklahoma and other labs in places including New Jersey, Colorado and Hawaii.

Di Liberto said that such cuts would mean “that we don’t have the data and resources that we need to be able to improve our ability to forecast and communicate these risks.”

Spinrad similarly expressed concerns that the cuts would hamper the administration’s ability to improve.

“The cuts, as proposed, to research guarantee that we will see no improvement to forecasts and services full stop,” he said.

He added that, typically, forecasts “improve by 24 hours every 10 years,” so a “72-hour forecast today is as good as the 48-hour forecast was 10 years ago and that’s because of the research.”

“If you turn off the research, that progress and improvement is going to stop, and you’re going to see a degradation of capability,” Spinrad said.

Since the federal budget is handled by Congress and not the administration, it’s not clear how many of the newly anticipated cuts will actually stick.

But there are also staffing cuts happening broadly across the administration, including at other related agencies such as the National Science Foundation.

“Basic science research has been trimmed pretty dramatically,” said David Stensrud, president of the American Meteorological Society. “The scientific enterprise as a whole is being proposed for really large cuts. That could really hurt what we’re trying to do to improve these kinds of warnings.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also indicated that it wants to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which helps respond after disasters.

Asked over the weekend whether he still wanted to phase out FEMA, Trump said, “FEMA is something we can talk about later, but right now they’re busy working.”

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Monday that “the president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need. Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that’s a policy discussion that will continue, and the president has always said he wants states to do as much as they can, if not more.”

Brunner,,,,,https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/08/1119630/why-the-us-and-the-west-could-lose-the-race-for-fusion-energy/,"Fusion energy holds the potential to shift a geopolitical landscape that is currently configured around fossil fuels.
The US and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and are home to many of the world’s pioneering private fusion efforts.
But in the past five years China’s support of fusion energy has surged, threatening to allow the country to dominate the industry.
China’s trajectory to dominating fusion and the West’s potential route to competing can be understood by looking at today’s most promising scientific and engineering pathway to achieve grid-relevant fusion energy.
The competition to lead the future of fusion energy is here.","Fusion energy holds the potential to shift a geopolitical landscape that is currently configured around fossil fuels. Harnessing fusion will deliver the energy resilience, security, and abundance needed for all modern industrial and service sectors. But these benefits will be controlled by the nation that leads in both developing the complex supply chains required and building fusion power plants at scales large enough to drive down economic costs.

The US and other Western countries will have to build strong supply chains across a range of technologies in addition to creating the fundamental technology behind practical fusion power plants. Investing in supply chains and scaling up complex production processes has increasingly been a strength of China’s and a weakness of the West, resulting in the migration of many critical industries from the West to China. With fusion, we run the risk that history will repeat itself. But it does not have to go that way.

The US and Europe were the dominant public funders of fusion energy research and are home to many of the world’s pioneering private fusion efforts. The West has consequently developed many of the basic technologies that will make fusion power work. But in the past five years China’s support of fusion energy has surged, threatening to allow the country to dominate the industry.

The industrial base available to support China’s nascent fusion energy industry could enable it to climb the learning curve much faster and more effectively than the West. Commercialization requires know-how, capabilities, and complementary assets, including supply chains and workforces in adjacent industries. And especially in comparison with China, the US and Europe have significantly under-supported the industrial assets needed for a fusion industry, such as thin-film processing and power electronics.

To compete, the US, allies, and partners must invest more heavily not only in fusion itself—which is already happening—but also in those adjacent technologies that are critical to the fusion industrial base.

China’s trajectory to dominating fusion and the West’s potential route to competing can be understood by looking at today’s most promising scientific and engineering pathway to achieve grid-relevant fusion energy. That pathway relies on the tokamak, a technology that uses a magnetic field to confine ionized gas—called plasma—and ultimately fuse nuclei. This process releases energy that is converted from heat to electricity. Tokamaks consist of several critical systems, including plasma confinement and heating, fuel production and processing, blankets and heat flux management, and power conversion.

A close look at the adjacent industries needed to build these critical systems clearly shows China’s advantage while also providing a glimpse into the challenges of building a fusion industrial base in the US or Europe. China has leadership in three of these six key industries, and the West is at risk of losing leadership in two more. China’s industrial might in thin-film processing, large metal-alloy structures, and power electronics provides a strong foundation to establish the upstream supply chain for fusion.

The importance of thin-film processing is evident in the plasma confinement system. Tokamaks use strong electromagnets to keep the fusion plasma in place, and the magnetic coils must be made from superconducting materials. Rare-earth barium copper oxide (REBCO) superconductors are the highest-performing materials available in sufficient quantity to be viable for use in fusion.

The REBCO industry, which relies on thin-film processing technologies, currently has low production volumes spanning globally distributed manufacturers. However, as the fusion industry grows, the manufacturing base for REBCO will likely consolidate among the industry players who are able to rapidly take advantage of economies of scale. China is today’s world leader in thin-film, high-volume manufacturing for solar panels and flat-panel displays, with the associated expert workforce, tooling sector, infrastructure, and upstream materials supply chain. Without significant attention and investment on the part of the West, China is well positioned to dominate REBCO thin-film processing for fusion magnets.

The electromagnets in a full-scale tokamak are as tall as a three-story building. Structures made using strong metal alloys are needed to hold these electromagnets around the large vacuum vessel that physically contains the magnetically confined plasma. Similar large-scale, complex metal structures are required for shipbuilding, aerospace, oil and gas infrastructure, and turbines. But fusion plants will require new versions of the alloys that are radiation-tolerant, able to withstand cryogenic temperatures, and corrosion-resistant. China’s manufacturing capacity and its metallurgical research efforts position it well to outcompete other global suppliers in making the necessary specialty metal alloys and machining them into the complex structures needed for fusion.

A tokamak also requires large-scale power electronics. Here again China dominates. Similar systems are found in the high-speed rail (HSR) industry, renewable microgrids, and arc furnaces. As of 2024, China had deployed over 48,000 kilometers of HSR. That is three times the length of Europe’s HSR network and 55 times as long as the Acela network in the US, which is slower than HSR. While other nations have a presence, China’s expertise is more recent and is being applied on a larger scale.

But this is not the end of the story. The West still has an opportunity to lead the other three adjacent industries important to the fusion supply chain: cryo-plants, fuel processing, and blankets.

The electromagnets in an operational tokamak need to be kept at cryogenic temperatures of around 20 Kelvin to remain superconducting. This requires large-scale, multi-megawatt cryogenic cooling plants. Here, the country best set up to lead the industry is less clear. The two major global suppliers of cryo-plants are Europe-based Linde Engineering and Air Liquide Engineering; the US has Air Products and Chemicals and Chart Industries. But they are not alone: China’s domestic champions in the cryogenic sector include Hangyang Group, SASPG, Kaifeng Air Separation, and SOPC. Each of these regions already has an industrial base that could scale up to meet the demands of fusion.

Fuel production for fusion is a nascent part of the industrial base requiring processing technologies for light-isotope gases—hydrogen, deuterium, and tritium. Some processing of light-isotope gases is already done at small scale in medicine, hydrogen weapons production, and scientific research in the US, Europe, and China. But the scale needed for the fusion industry does not exist in today’s industrial base, presenting a major opportunity to develop the needed capabilities.

Similarly, blankets and heat flux management are an opportunity for the West. The blanket is the medium used to absorb energy from the fusion reaction and to breed tritium. Commercial-scale blankets will require entirely novel technology. To date, no adjacent industries have relevant commercial expertise in liquid lithium, lead-lithium eutectic, or fusion-specific molten salts that are required for blanket technology. Some overlapping blanket technologies are in early-stage development by the nuclear fission industry. As the largest producer of beryllium in the world, the US has an opportunity to capture leadership because that element is a key material in leading fusion blanket concepts. But the use of beryllium must be coupled with technology development programs for the other specialty blanket components.

These six industries will prove critical to scaling fusion energy. In some, such as thin-film processing and large metal-alloy structures, China already has a sizable advantage. Crucially, China recognizes the importance of these adjacent industries and is actively harnessing them in its fusion efforts. For example, China launched a fusion consortium that consists of industrial giants spanning the steel, machine tooling, electric grid, power generation, and aerospace sectors. It will be extremely difficult for the West to catch up in these areas, but policymakers and business leaders must pay attention and try to create robust alternative supply chains.

As the industrial area of greatest strength, cryo-plants could continue to be an opportunity for leadership in the West. Bolstering Western cryo-plant production by creating demand for natural-gas liquefaction will be a major boon to the future cryo-plant supply chain that will support fusion energy.

The US and European countries also have an opportunity to lead in the emerging industrial areas of fuel processing and blanket technologies. Doing so will require policymakers to work with companies to ensure that public and private funding is allocated to these critical emerging supply chains. Governments may well need to serve as early customers and provide debt financing for significant capital investment. Governments can also do better to incentivize private capital and equity financing—for example, through favorable capital-gains taxation. In lagging areas of thin-film and alloy production, the US and Europe will likely need partners, such as South Korea and Japan, that have the industrial bases to compete globally with China.

The need to connect and capitalize multiple industries and supply chains will require long-term thinking and clear leadership. A focus on the demand side of these complementary industries is essential. Fusion is a decade away from maturation, so its supplier base must be derisked and made profitable in the near term by focusing on other primary demand markets that contribute to our economic vitality. To name a few, policymakers can support modernization of the grid to bolster domestic demand for power electronics and domestic semiconductor manufacturing to support thin-film processing.

The West must also focus on the demand for energy production itself. As the world’s largest energy consumer, China will leverage demand from its massive domestic market to climb the learning curve and bolster national champions. This is a strategy that China has wielded with tremendous success to dominate global manufacturing, most recently in the electric-vehicle industry. Taken together, supply- and demand-side investment have been a winning strategy for China.

The competition to lead the future of fusion energy is here. Now is the moment for the US and its Western allies to start investing in the foundational innovation ecosystem needed for a vibrant and resilient industrial base to support it.

While the Trump administration has consistently painted its austerity measures as cost-saving, Carter argues the real cost is measured in human lives.
And most of all, it’s about people.” This isn’t Carter’s first time clashing with the Trump administration on emergency management.
When federal warning systems falter or response efforts lag, it’s these communities that suffer first and longest.
“We cannot afford to wait for the next disaster to remind us of what we failed to do,” Carter said.","As the Gulf South braces for another hurricane season, the catastrophic flooding in Texas has become a stark warning of what can—and will—happen when the federal government abandons its responsibility to protect the public. At the forefront of that warning is Congressman Troy A. Carter, Sr. (D-LA), who issued a blistering statement today directed at President Donald Trump and his newly appointed Secretary of Homeland Security, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem.

Carter, who serves as both the U.S. Representative for Louisiana’s 2nd District and Co-Chair of the Congressional Disaster Recovery Caucus, didn’t mince words. “The deadly flooding in Texas is a sobering reminder of what happens when preparation is ignored and prevention is undercut,” Carter said. “Dozens of lives have been lost. Families are grieving. And across the Gulf South, communities are bracing for what could come next.”

But Carter’s message wasn’t just a lament—it was a call to action rooted in deep frustration over the federal government’s systemic failure to invest in critical disaster infrastructure. Since Trump returned to office, his administration has implemented sweeping budget cuts to FEMA, NOAA, and the National Weather Service—agencies that play a pivotal role in predicting and responding to climate-related disasters. In addition, advanced satellite systems that once provided vital early warnings have been quietly decommissioned.

“These are not harmless bureaucratic changes—they are life-threatening decisions,” Carter said. And in a region already bearing the scars of Katrina, Ida, and countless unnamed storms, the consequences of underfunding emergency response aren’t hypothetical. They’re a matter of life and death.

Louisiana, still recovering from past disasters and perpetually under threat, is now facing peak hurricane season with fewer tools and fewer safeguards. Carter laid blame squarely on the administration’s shoulders. “It is unacceptable for President Trump to deflect responsibility while families suffer the consequences. We need accountability. We need action.”

In his statement, Carter outlined three urgent demands to the President and DHS Secretary Noem:

Fully restore and strengthen funding for FEMA, NOAA, and the National Weather Service.

Reactivate and upgrade satellite systems that provide critical early warnings.

Ensure disaster response agencies are fully staffed and mission-ready—before the next emergency strikes.

While the Trump administration has consistently painted its austerity measures as cost-saving, Carter argues the real cost is measured in human lives. “This is not about partisanship—it’s about protection. It’s about preparation. And most of all, it’s about people.”

This isn’t Carter’s first time clashing with the Trump administration on emergency management. As a longtime advocate for environmental justice and equitable recovery, he’s been outspoken about the structural inequalities that magnify disaster impacts in majority-Black, working-class communities like New Orleans. When federal warning systems falter or response efforts lag, it’s these communities that suffer first and longest.

As the climate crisis intensifies and extreme weather becomes more frequent, the Congressman emphasized that the stakes are only rising. “We cannot afford to wait for the next disaster to remind us of what we failed to do,” Carter said. “I will continue to fight for the resources, technology, and readiness our communities need and deserve.”

In a city that has known the costs of governmental neglect all too well, Carter’s statement is a demand for justice. As the waters rise again, it’s a reminder that ignoring science, slashing budgets, and deflecting blame will never protect the people of New Orleans, or anyone else in the path of the next storm.",https://bigeasymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2022-04-27-2.13.28-PM.png,N,,2025-07-08 07:13:02.051939

The order directs the Treasury department to enforce the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects that were rolled back in the budget bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump last week.

It also directs the Interior department to review and revise any policies that favor renewables over other energy sources.

Both agencies are required to submit a report to the White House within 45 days detailing actions taken.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act effectively ends renewable energy tax credits after 2026 if projects have not started construction. Wind and solar projects whose construction starts after that must be placed in service by the end of 2027. Under previous law, project developers would have been able to claim a 30% tax credit through 2032.

Hopes rose that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington today could lead to a ceasefire.
A joint declaration condemning tariffs refrained from naming US President Donald Trump, and mentioned Ukraine only once.
While some openings may predate the current administration, the number has roughly doubled since US President Donald Trump returned to office, The New York Times reported.","Washington reportedly offered Brussels a relatively benign trade deal, helping calm markets worried by fresh White House tariff threats.

The agreement would largely leave American import duties at 10%, Politico said, lower than US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs.

Still, European officials cautioned that any agreement would only be preliminary, and from their perspective amounts to damage mitigation because duties would be higher than prior to Trump’s ascension.

Analysts, meanwhile, were skeptical about Trump’s letters outlining new duties for 12 countries effective Aug. 1: “I don’t even know if anybody understands the difference between what was announced today, what was there previously, and if it will actually be implemented,” one told CNBC.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated US President Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize, even as reports underlined the hurdles to lasting calm in the Middle East.

On a trip to Washington, Netanyahu said Trump was “forging peace… in one region after another,” speaking as Israel and Hamas neared a truce over the war in Gaza. Yet the two sides still disagree on key issues, and prior ceasefire talks have stumbled at later stages.

A relative quiet between Israel and Iran also appeared at risk following their recent war: Tehran’s president said that Israel had sought to assassinate him, while Axios reported that Israeli officials believe they have Washington’s green light to strike Iran again if they deem necessary.

French President Emmanuel Macron said France and the UK would seek to “deepen our cooperation” as he arrived in the country Tuesday, the first state visit by a European Union leader since Brexit.

Relations between London and Paris were frosty for years after Britain voted to leave the union, but have — like Britain’s ties with the rest of the continent — begun to thaw.

“Together, we will address the major challenges of our time: security, defence, nuclear energy, space, innovation, artificial intelligence, migration, and culture,” Macron said on X as he arrived for the three-day visit.

Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a lot to discuss: Starmer is under pressure over migrants crossing the English Channel, a flow he hopes France will help curb, and the leaders of Europe’s only nuclear-armed powers are both keen to support Ukraine as the US retreats.

The death toll from flooding in Texas surpassed 100 on Monday, as officials faced scrutiny over the adequacy of local warning systems.

National Weather Service meteorologists didn’t err in their forecasts, experts said — the agency escalated flood warnings ahead of the storm — but “even quite good weather forecasts do not automatically translate into life-saving predictions,” one climate scientist said. Rather, flood-warning sirens could have made a difference, Texas’ lieutenant governor said Monday, adding that they must be in place by next summer.

Experts also dismissed conspiracy theories that cloud seeding technology caused the flooding; similar misinformation surfaced after damaging floods hit the United Arab Emirates last year.

Prominent Chinese experts sounded the alarm over the serious threats facing the world’s second-biggest economy.

Beijing’s trade war with Washington has dominated attention, and Chinese officials previously downplayed the myriad long-term risks to growth, making the latest warnings notable.

A leading Communist Party journal recently cautioned against “overcapacity” — a term Beijing once fiercely contested — while an influential economic adviser joined a growing number of voices saying China must guard against involution, or economically destructive price wars.

Meanwhile Caixin, the highly regarded business magazine, reported that China’s debt-laden property developers are imposing steep haircuts on creditors to avert bankruptcy, creating “a perilous new chapter” in the country’s real estate crisis.

Passengers at some US airports no longer have to remove their shoes at security.

Eight airports in different states appeared to have dropped the requirement, in place since 2006 after a British man in 2001 attempted to destroy an airliner with explosives hidden in a shoe.

Other Global War on Terror-era security measures may also be slowly winding down: Several European airports have relaxed the rule limiting carry-on liquids to 100 ml (3.4 oz), thanks to improved scanning techniques.

The news counters the usual trend of security measures endlessly ratcheting up, because it is politically difficult to reduce them, as the security expert Bruce Schneier has written.

US President Donald Trump on Monday threatened higher tariffs on several countries unless they strike trade deals by Aug. 1.

Trump sent letters to major trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, dictating new blanket tariffs after extending the July 9 deadline for imposing his “Liberation Day” duties.

The letters, which caused US stocks to tumble, are a message to those countries where White House officials “don’t believe that trade talks are going particularly well,” a former trade negotiator said. The notices also deal a blow to “hopes that Trump would scale back tariff threats and de-escalate a trade war,” FXStreet wrote. “Once again, Trump is playing hardball… and markets have been jolted awake.”

Tesla shares fell steeply Monday after CEO Elon Musk vowed to form a new US political party.

Musk’s pledge to create the “America Party” stemmed from his rift with President Donald Trump, especially over his criticism of Trump’s sweeping tax-and-spending package. Analysts warned that forming a new party could hurt Musk’s businesses; Tesla’s stock price fell nearly 7% Monday.

Tesla investors “only see downside from his dip back into politics,” one analyst said. Musk’s split with Trump could also hurt the EV company’s business in China: The billionaire and former White House adviser was once seen as a “partner for Beijing in Washington,” The Wall Street Journal wrote, but he is of less value to the Chinese government as an outsider.

Hopes rose that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with US President Donald Trump in Washington today could lead to a ceasefire.

Trump is keen to achieve a peace deal in Gaza, and Netanyahu is in a strong position domestically after attacks on Iran severely weakened Israel’s regional rival. That could give him breathing space to announce a truce without suffering a right-wing revolt, The Guardian reported.

Hamas responded “positively” last week to Israel’s proposal of a 60-day ceasefire, although it wants a permanent end to the war. Israel has long rejected that demand, but, under pressure from Trump and isolated diplomatically after nearly two years of war, it has agreed to send negotiators to Qatar for indirect talks.

China hit back at European Union trade restrictions, weeks before a summit meant to celebrate 50 years of the pair officially establishing diplomatic relations.

Beijing’s ban on the sale of European medical devices came in response to Brussels’ own curbs. The move was largely symbolic — such trade is relatively minimal — but demonstrated the worsening of their ties: Brussels is reportedly pressuring Beijing to raise its target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions ahead of this month’s meeting.

The two are also locked in disputes over China’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, EU curbs on Chinese EV sales, and European dependence on Chinese rare earths. “Tensions are rising each day as we approach the summit,” one expert told Le Monde.

Tesla shares fell steeply Monday after the company’s CEO Elon Musk pushed ahead with his plans to form a new political party.

The world’s richest man — and former White House adviser — said he would form the “America Party” after US President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law his signature tax and spending bill, which Musk described as an “abomination.”

Analysts have said directly challenging Trump could hurt Musk’s businesses, which rely on billions in government contracts and subsidies. Tesla shares were down about 7% after trading opened on Monday.

Most Americans believe the country needs a third major party, but Musk “has yet to outline a concrete plan forward,” and would have to navigate complex election laws and ballot access regulations, Politico wrote.

Major oil producers agreed to ramp up output by more than expected despite falling crude prices.

The OPEC bloc and its partners have kept increasing production — this time by 550,000 barrels per day — even with prices mired near multi-year lows, officially voicing confidence about global economic prospects and forecasting a strong summer vacation season, a time when car use tends to increase.

Yet experts say the persistent steps to raise output are part of long-term efforts to crowd out US shale companies as well as to maintain adherence to national quotas within the grouping, all while addressing US President Donald Trump’s calls for lower oil prices.

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced higher duties on several countries, effective Aug. 1, after extending the July 9 deadline for his reciprocal tariff reprieve.

Trump sent letters to Japan and South Korea announcing 25% blanket tariffs, which are effectively the “Liberation Day” rates for the two major trading partners. He also sent notices to other countries, including Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Laos, and Myanmar, dictating new tariff rates.

US stocks tumbled following the announcement, which dealt a blow to “hopes that Trump would scale back tariff threats and de-escalate a trade war,” FXStreet wrote.

“Once again, Trump is playing hardball when it comes to trade policy, and markets have been jolted awake.”

US President Donald Trump made fresh tariff threats against major trading partners even as his Treasury secretary suggested extending a pause on the levies.

The sharply diverging remarks encapsulated the White House’s headspinning trade policy: Trump threatened to impose a 10% duty on countries aligned with the BRICS bloc following a weekend summit, and said the US would begin delivering tariff letters on Monday. However, Scott Bessent said the letters wouldn’t contain ultimatums and voiced openness to continuing trade negotiations beyond Wednesday, when a reprieve on Washington’s “Liberation Day” duties expires. Global stock markets fell amid the uncertainty.

The White House’s rhetoric has become more circumspect recently: The administration predicted it would reach 90 trade deals during its 90-day tariff suspension, but is now targeting a handful of agreements while postponing the most vexing issues.

The floods in central Texas are among the deadliest in the US for over a century.

At least 81 people, including dozens of children, are dead and more than 40 still missing, with a huge search-and-rescue operation underway.

As the state grapples with the tragedy, it is also confronting the reality of extreme weather events that are becoming ever more frequent. Insurance premiums are up — they rose 19% last year and 21% in 2023, The Washington Post reported recently — and many Texas homes are now uninsurable.

The problem is particularly acute as the state has seen huge population growth in recent years, especially in popular metro areas such as Houston and Austin, partly thanks to its low housing costs.

The River Seine reopened for swimming for the first time in more than a century.

In the 1970s, the Paris river was considered biologically dead thanks to severe pollution; much of the city’s wastewater poured into it untreated, and wildlife all but disappeared. But after decades of improved sanitation, its ecosystem is thriving, and the number of fish species has tripled since 1990.

A $1.6 billion cleanup operation ahead of the 2024 Olympics accelerated the process, and now, three bathing sites have opened, with the city’s mayor joining in on the first day.

Similar projects have created clean urban swimming sites in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Copenhagen, while the Thames, once a similarly dead zone, has also seen wildlife return.

Israel sent negotiators to Qatar on Sunday in a bid to broker a Gaza ceasefire with Hamas, under renewed pressure from US President Donald Trump to reach a deal.

Hamas has signaled a “positive response” to a US-backed proposal for a 60-day truce, but still asked for changes that Israel opposes: “We’ve been here before,” one Israel policy expert said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is set to meet with Trump in Washington on Monday, is pulled between the US and his allies on the far right who oppose a ceasefire.

But he will find it “more difficult to evade an agreement” given Trump’s renewed Middle East diplomatic push in the wake of US strikes on Iran, Haaretz’s Amos Harel wrote.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared in public for the first time Saturday after spending nearly a month in hiding during the country’s brief conflict with Israel.

Khamenei’s emergence at a religious gathering in Tehran seemed intended as a projection of stability and strength after weeks of assassination threats and speculation about his health.

Iran’s leaders have sought to tap into nationalist sentiment in the wake of the conflict with Israel and US strikes on the country’s nuclear facilities; Khamenei requested the speaker at Saturday’s event recite a song with “deep nationalist themes,” the Financial Times reported.

Analysts are closely watching Khamenei for signs about the future of Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which some experts believe could accelerate.

The Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday celebrations on Sunday raised fraught questions surrounding his succession plans.

The spiritual leader last week said only his inner circle has the authority to identify his reincarnation, a direct challenge to China: Beijing has said it must approve the next head of Tibetan Buddhism.

The Dalai Lama, who lives in self-imposed exile in India, has suggested his reincarnation may be found outside of China, and some Tibetans worry Beijing will try to name a rival.

Long perceived as a symbol of resistance against Chinese control of Tibet, the Dalai Lama finds himself increasingly “caught geopolitically” between New Delhi and Beijing, an expert told The Guardian.

This weekend’s BRICS summit in Brazil put a spotlight on the growing internal divisions within the bloc of developing nations.

About half of the group’s leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, didn’t attend the gathering. While BRICS has expanded from five members — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — to 11 in the last two years, the additions have brought fresh points of contention, and perhaps diluted its clout.

Delegates avoided any controversial subjects that might trigger Washington’s ire, analysts said.

A joint declaration condemning tariffs refrained from naming US President Donald Trump, and mentioned Ukraine only once. It marked a contrast from last year’s gathering in Russia, where the Kremlin pushed for alternatives to US-dominated financial systems.

Flash floods in the state of Texas killed at least 78 people and left dozens more missing, officials said Sunday.

Four months’ worth of rain — 1.8 trillion gallons — fell in just hours on Friday. Authorities are unsure how many people remain unaccounted for, but they include 10 children who were at a summer camp.

The tragedy has brought scrutiny on the National Weather Service: The agency’s central Texas offices have several critical vacancies. While some openings may predate the current administration, the number has roughly doubled since US President Donald Trump returned to office, The New York Times reported.

That means there are fewer people able to coordinate with local authorities, possibly hampering the emergency response, experts said.","https://img.semafor.com/4f0cf069c81733c263eedfd0cfa370413ddf33a4-8192x5464.jpg?rect=0,582,8192,4301&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-07-08 10:12:26.820762

That was the cap to this past holiday weekend in central North Carolina. An early season tropical storm/depression that seemed initially like no particular big deal suddenly exploded to dump as much as 10 inches of rain in some areas, causing the Eno River to experience a record rise of more than 22 feet in four hours – a rise that beat even the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Fran in 1996 – and massive damage ensued.

Dozens of people had to be rescued, and scores of homes and businesses were damaged. Many major roads and highways were closed, damaged or both. At least one person died.

And, of course, the disastrous flooding here was just small potatoes compared to the horror that occurred in the Texas hill country just days before. At last count, the death toll there from a spate of summer thunderstorms had already surpassed 100, with many people still missing.

Meanwhile, this year’s Atlantic hurricane season has only just begun and, as the people of western North Carolina who saw their region devastated last fall by Hurricane Helene are painfully aware, won’t ramp up to full song until mid-August through late September.

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s season promises to be another active one, with a range of 13 to 19 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), 6-10 hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).

So, what gives? Tropical weather and flooding rains have always been fact of life in the eastern half of the United States. Are we just having a run of bad luck?

Unfortunately, the answer to the latter question is almost assuredly a loud and clear “no.”

While it’s true that there’s nothing new about bad weather, as scientists have been telling us for decades, the frequency and severity of modern storms is being greatly worsened by climate change.

As reporter Raymond Zhong of the New York Times reported on July 5:

“Colossal bursts of rain like the ones that caused the deadly flooding in Texas are becoming more frequent and intense around the globe as the burning of fossil fuels heats the planet, scientists say.

Warm air holds more moisture than cool air, and as temperatures rise, storms can produce bigger downpours. When met on the ground with outdated infrastructure or inadequate warning systems, the results can be catastrophic.”

At the same time, quite perversely, climate-change-driven drought and desertification continue to spread in other parts of the planet. The situation is especially acute in parts of Africa where they are contributing to widespread hunger and mass migration.

And tragically, these are situations that are only going to get worse and soon – especially if the planet’s rapidly growing human population continues to do little-to-nothing to curb its fossil fuel addiction, while simultaneously developing more and more open land with housing and other infrastructure in which speed and short-term profits trump sustainability.

In other words, this past weekend’s weather in our state was yet another wake-up call to the terrifying fact that we are in the midst of a global emergency that cries out for an urgent, all-hands-on-deck response from government, private industry, academia, and average people. While complete healing of the planet would take centuries, we can still minimize the damage in the decades to come by acting with speed, determination, urgency and creativity.

Quite amazingly and inexcusably, however, this is not the path our leaders are following. To the contrary, the Trump administration – abetted by Republicans in Congress and state legislatures like North Carolina’s – are doing the precise opposite of what is so urgently necessary.

As AP reported, the massive mega-bill signed into law by Trump last Friday “supports mining, drilling and production of the oil, coal and gas that are largely driving Earth’s warming and the increasingly deadly and costly extreme weather that comes with it,” while at the same time slashing “tax credits for clean technologies including wind and solar energy.”

Meanwhile, the bill’s answer to the migration crisis – a phenomenon fueled in part by climate change – is to ramp up the creation of a “show us your papers” police state that conjures up some of the worst imagery from authoritarian regimes Americans once considered the enemies of freedom.

And here in North Carolina, it’s expected that Republican legislative leaders will seek later this month to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a bill that would roll back the state’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and spur the construction of more fossil fuel-fired power plants.

All in all, it’s a remarkable and maddening state of affairs. At a time of urgent environmental and human crises, our elected leaders have adopted a policy of not just fiddling while Rome burns and floods, but of conducting an entire symphony orchestra of delusional actions designed to expedite and worsen the destruction.

And the need for all Americans to rise up and demand an immediate reversal of this disastrous malfeasance could not be more urgent.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-flooding-Getty2025-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 07:12:45.051630

Rather, the role of climate change is like steroids for the weather – it injects an extra dose of intensity into existing weather patterns.” BBC News says: “The influence of climate change cannot be ignored as another factor in extreme weather events like this.
The Financial Times reports that “Trump’s administration pushed back on allegations that cuts to the federal workforce hampered its response” to the floods.
She says: “We now live in an era of climate change with faster, stronger and less predictable storms.
Climate change is causing seas to rise and storms to intensify, putting landscapes and wildlife at risk.","There is ongoing media coverage of the flash flooding that hit Texas last week, killing more than 100 people. Euronews says: “A slow-moving storm brought heavy rainfall to the so-called hill country, a region of rocky hills, plains and valleys between San Antonio and Austin, overwhelming riverbanks and inundating small towns with water that rose faster than many could escape.” The outlet reports that “officials have repeatedly referred to the event as a ‘100-year flood’”. However, it says the term “might not reflect present and future risks”. It continues: “Central Texas has long been known as ‘flash flood alley’ for its combination of steep terrain, tropical moisture and slow-moving storms – especially in July. But meteorologists say the scale of this week’s rainfall was anything but typical…The combination of near-record water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, remnants of Tropical Storm Barry and the lack of a jet stream to blow it away funnelled extreme moisture into Texas. In retrospect, a warning sign that the floods could be historic.” Bloomberg says: “The surrounding county was 100% in drought at the start of July. Ironically, that drought helped beget the deadly floods that swept through the region on Friday.” The Climate Brink says: “Climate change doesn’t cause rain events. Rather, the role of climate change is like steroids for the weather – it injects an extra dose of intensity into existing weather patterns.” BBC News says: “The influence of climate change cannot be ignored as another factor in extreme weather events like this. Whilst it is difficult to directly attribute the influence of the warming planet to one particular weather event, sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, where some of the air originated from, continue to be warmer than normal.”

The Independent says: “The National Weather Service (NWS) predicted between 1 and 3 inches of rain, with some isolated spots possibly getting 5 to 7 inches. Instead, parts of Kerr County were slammed with 10 to 15 inches, and in some places, over 20 inches, within a few hours.” The Hill reports that flood warnings “weren’t heard by the people who needed them”. It continues: “State and county officials told reporters that the storm had come without warning. But a wide array of meteorologists – and the Trump administration itself – has argued that those officials, as well as local residents, received a long train of advisories that a dangerous flood was gathering. The timeline of the floods on Friday, experts say, revealed a deadly gap in the ‘last mile’ system that turns those forecasts into life-saving action.” According to the Independent, former NWS employees have “defended” the actions taken, arguing that the flood warnings issued were “about as timely and accurate as could be expected with the data they had”. The Associated Press reports that “the NWS office responsible for that region had five staffers on duty as thunderstorms formed over Texas Thursday evening, the usual number for an overnight shift when severe weather is expected”.

The Guardian reports that Texas senator Ted Cruz has “ensured a reduction in funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) efforts to improve future weather forecasting of events that cause the sort of extreme floods that are being worsened by the human-caused climate crisis”. It adds: “A further $50m in NOAA grants to study climate-related impacts on oceans, weather systems and coastal ecosystems was also removed.” The Hill reports that Democrats are “calling for investigations into why the alert systems in place were not more effective”. Yale Climate Connections says that “the loss this year of many of the weather service’s most experienced leaders – people with decades of experience in the particular weather vulnerabilities in local areas – poses a significant danger to the mission of protecting people and property”. The New York Times notes that “Trump has suggested ‘phasing out’ the Federal Emergency Management Agency and handing its authority to states”. The Financial Times reports that “Trump’s administration pushed back on allegations that cuts to the federal workforce hampered its response” to the floods. The New York Times airports that Trump has “cautioned against casting blame” for the flooding. BBC Verify reports that Trump’s proposed cuts of 25% to the budget of NOAA “have not yet taken effect” so “can’t have directly contributed to the Texas tragedy”. It adds: “Staffing cuts could theoretically have had a negative impact on the NWS performance and some NWS employees had warned of their potential impact on safety. But – at this stage – we don’t have evidence to show if they contributed to the Texas tragedy.”

Bloomberg says: “In the aftermath of devastating floods in Texas, social media users have spread misinformation that cloud seeding is to blame. Meteorologists have been quick to debunk the claim, but the rumours underline how weather can be a magnet for conspiracy theories.” The Independent reports that “a fresh spell of thunderstorms and flash flooding could strike across central Texas”. Bloomberg reports that the risk of heavy rainfall rose on Monday. Separately, Bloomberg says: “On the list of disasters costing $1bn or more, Texas ranked first from 1980 to 2024 with 190, according to data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.” The flooding is covered by a wide range of other outlets, including CBS News, the Times of India, Al Jazeera, Axios, Deutsche Welle, the Daily Telegraph, Sky News, Scientific American, Forbes and the MailOnline.

A group of 18 EU member states have written to the European Commission asking for “further changes to the bloc’s anti-deforestation law”, Reuters reports. It lists the signatories to the letter, which do not include Germany, France or Spain. The newswire says: “From December, the deforestation law, a world first, will require operators placing goods including soy, beef and palm oil, onto the EU market to provide proof their products did not cause deforestation…Brussels has already delayed its launch by a year and cut back reporting rules following criticism from trading partners, including the US, as well as from EU countries.” The outlet reports that the letter calls for the EU rules to exclude imports from countries at “low risk” of deforestation. Bloomberg quotes the letter as saying: “Instead of targeting deforestation where the risk is highest, the regulation imposes disproportionate bureaucratic obligations on countries, where deforestation is demonstrably insignificant.”

In other EU news, Euractiv reports that the EU is launching a review of its law banning petrol and diesel cars from 2035. Reuters reports that the EU “will develop rules for ‘nature credits’ that pay farmers and foresters to take care of ecosystems, in an attempt to make this work more economically beneficial, the European Commission said on Monday”. Meanwhile, the Press Association reports that “Authorities in Greece imposed mandatory work breaks on Monday in parts of the country where temperatures are expected to exceed 40C, with the heat wave forecast to last through Thursday”. And the Guardian reports that “low water levels after heatwaves and drought are limiting shipping on some of Europe’s biggest rivers including the Rhine and the Danube and pushing up transport costs”.

Donald Trump yesterday signed an executive order telling federal agencies to “strengthen provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that repeal or modify tax credits for solar and wind energy projects”, Reuters reports. The newswire continues: “In an executive order, Trump said the renewable energy resources were unreliable, expensive, displaced more dependable energy sources, were dependent on foreign-controlled supply chains and were harmful to the natural environment and electric grid. The order directs the Treasury department to enforce the phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar projects that were rolled back in the budget bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump last week. It also directs the Interior department to review and revise any policies that favour renewables over other energy sources. Both agencies are required to submit a report to the White House within 45 days detailing actions taken.” Bloomberg reports that the order “also calls for the implementation of restrictions on incentives for clean-energy projects that have ties to foreign entities of concern, including China”.

In other US news, the Associated Press reports that “federal officials on Monday took a first step toward reopening vast areas of public lands in two Western states to new coal [mining] sales as part of President Donald Trump’s push to expand US fossil fuel production”. It continues: “The Interior Department proposal comes after the Biden administration, citing climate change, tried to end sales of the fuel from the nation’s most productive coal fields.” Bloomberg reports that “a Trump administration report warns that blackouts in the US could increase 100 times by 2030 due to an expected increase in power demand brought on by AI, and blames the expected shortfall on the closures of coal and natural gas power plants and the over-reliance on renewable energy”. The outlet notes: “Renewables were positioned to be leading providers of energy supply in coming years, with utility-scale solar last year accounting for 61% of US capacity additions…Solar was primed for further growth because it’s the cheapest domestic electric source, batteries capable of deploying excess power in the evening have become mainstream, and it’s quicker to build than natural gas-fired plants or atomic reactors.”

Former acting deputy secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security, MaryAnn Tierney, writes in the New York Times about the flooding in Texas. She says: “We now live in an era of climate change with faster, stronger and less predictable storms. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, now warns of ‘rapid intensification,’ when tropical systems quickly escalate from mild to major hurricanes in a matter of hours. That compresses the time emergency managers have to evacuate communities, marshal resources and respond. It leaves less room for error and demands more from the systems that protect us. And yet, the very system designed to meet this moment is being hollowed out. The uncomfortable truth is this: With each passing day, the federal government is becoming less prepared to face the next big disaster. And as the risk grows, the ability to deliver on its vital disaster response mission is shrinking.” She argues that Trump’s plan to phase out FEMA after the 2025 hurricane season will result in “a slower, weaker, more fragmented federal response to the very disasters that are becoming more frequent and more complex”. Elsewhere, Kathy Baughman McLeod, a former member of the FEMA National Advisory Council and a state official in Florida, has penned a Substack piece with Emma Howard Boyd, the former chair of the UK’s Environment Agency. They write that the Texas flooding “has underscored the critical need for robust, proactive emergency measures both in the US and the UK”. They say that Texas officials “appeared to rely primarily on Facebook and Twitter/X to issue emergency flood alerts”, but argue that this is “not just inadequate – it’s dangerous”. They continue: “In today’s climate reality, every employer, teacher, elected official, sports coach, pastor and summer school leaders must immediately raise their climate disaster literacy. Every household and organisation should know how to receive early warnings, where to find credible updates and what actions to take to keep people safe.” They add that the UK also needs “a cultural shift on climate literacy and informed, early action”. In other US comment, Wall Street Journal opinion columnist Walter Russell Mead claims, under a headline touting a “fossil-fuel boom in the Americas”, that the “geopolitics of energy are shifting in Washington’s direction”.

In an interview with the Rest is Politics: Leading podcast, Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of the UK’s advisory Climate Change Committee tackles the reasons why electricity is expensive (“driven up by the cost of gas” and facing policy costs that do not apply to gas), as well as the cost of reaching net-zero (“we’ve halved the costs…because the technologies have continued to improve”). Meanwhile, author and editor Tom Hardy writes in the Ecologist that “the Labour government still refuses to marginalise those working to undermine climate policy using spin and misinformation”. He says: “The new Labour government in Britain has continued the [previous administration’s] authoritarian crackdown on dissent and watering down of climate targets to appease the fossil fuel lobbyists of Tufton Street, and welcomed the erstwhile enemies of democracy direct action to the administration. At the same time, we have witnessed crumbling of the so-called fourth pillar of democracy – the press – and its failure to hold the government accountable for abandoning its campaign promises.”

In other UK comment, Hilary McGrady, the director general of the National Trust, writes in the lead comment slot for today’s Daily Express about “Enterprise Neptune”. She says the project, started six decades ago, is “one of the biggest environmental campaigns in Europe” aimed at restoring England’s coastlines. She continues: “But as we look back on the successes, we must be clear the job is far from over. Today our coastline is facing perhaps its greatest challenge yet. Climate change is causing seas to rise and storms to intensify, putting landscapes and wildlife at risk. The government’s own advisor, the Committee on Climate Change, has warned that the UK simply isn’t prepared…The Trust has pledged to restore nature over the next 10 years, so our seas, cliffs, countryside and cities are once again bursting with wildlife and playing their part to minimise climate threats.” Elsewhere, Financial Times contributing columnist, Patti Waldmeit, writes about electric boats, saying that “the emissions-friendly watercraft industry is struggling to bring recreational sailors and freighters on board”.",,N,,2025-07-08 07:12:35.681350

According to studies by Plante Moran, changing EV demand and pivots to or from electrification can greatly affect supplier trust.","Automotive OEMs are pausing plans and reducing battery investments in the US while the government removes EV incentives for customers and carmakers alike.

The US government has been removing incentives for EVs since president Donald Trump was inaugurated in January, and alongside sliding consumer demand, OEMs in America have been redefining their supply chains to lean more on ICE vehicles.

With the Senate and Congress having now passed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ act, EV tax credits for consumers will be ended on 30 September, earlier than originally planned, which will further dissuade consumer uptake. This adds to an already cost-pressured market where OEMs have struggled to balance supply and demand for EVs.

Some of the largest automakers have halted plans for new battery plants in the US, with GM reducing their planned plants from four to three, and Ford putting one of its two planned plants on hold indefinitely. The former sold its stake in its plant in Lansing, Michigan to its JV partner LG Energy Solution at the end of last year, while the latter was planning on letting Nissan use part of its Kentucky battery plant instead, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Even outside the US in the North America region, EV investments have been slowing. Once ally of Trump, CEO of Tesla Elon Musk paused his plans to build a gigafactory in Mexico back in July until after the election. Since then, the factory plans have remained paused. Japanese firm AESC, which supplies batteries to BMW, also stopped construction on its $1.6 billion plant in South Carolina due to market uncertainty at the beginning of last month.

The row back of battery plants and investments could have an effect on supplier relations within the US. According to studies by Plante Moran, changing EV demand and pivots to or from electrification can greatly affect supplier trust. Dave Andrea, principal at Plante Moran, previously told Automotive Logistics: “That’s one area where there needs to be better communication. Even though there is still a lot of unused capacity, and underutilised capacity because of postponed or cancelled EV programmes, I think this comes back into the financial aspect of it of how the vehicle manufacturers are approaching handling sunk costs, and fairness and equitable sharing of risk and cost, because both the OEM and the supplier are in the same boat.”

Knock-on effects of US trade in Europe

At the same time, Europe’s EV forecast has been dropping, due in part to regulatory and market challenges. Evolving EU battery regulations require greater traceability, recycling efficiency and material localisation, making sourcing materials more difficult. And with China threatening exports of rare earth minerals globally (which are much needed in EV batteries), sourcing is getting more difficult.

As a result, more investments are popping up in the EU and the UK. In May this year, the UK announced a $1.4 billion funding deal for Japanese battery maker AESC’s gigafactory in Sunderland, north England, producing batteries for 100,000 EVs annually. The gigafactory will be located near Nissan’s plant, which announced two years ago that it would build two EV models at the factory.

The investment is being supported by the UK government, highlighting just how important government incentives and cash injections are to boosting the EV industry, in comparison to the US’ withdrawal of funding and incentives.",https://image.automotivelogistics.media/642776.jpg?imageId=642776&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-07-08 13:40:42.753485

“(The changes) would almost certainly include the loss of jobs on our team,” wrote Will Etheridge, CEO of Southern Energy Management in Raleigh. “I’m telling you that because you deserve transparency and the truth — even if that truth is uncomfortable.”

The bill, which President Donald Trump signed on Friday, takes an ax to clean energy incentives, including killing a 30% tax credit for rooftop residential solar by the end of the year that the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act had extended into the next decade. Trump has called the clean energy tax credits in the climate law part of a “green new scam” that improperly shifts taxpayer subsidies to help the “globalist climate agenda” and energy sources like wind and solar.

Businesses and analysts say the GOP-backed bill will likely reverse the sector’s growth and eliminate jobs.

“The residential solar industry is going to be absolutely creamed by this,” said Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a business group that advocates for pro-environment policies.

President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” takes aim at renewables broadly, including phasing out tax credits enjoyed by utility-scale solar and wind. But cutting the residential solar credit will happen sooner.

Companies have announced more than $20 billion in clean-energy investments in North Carolina in recent years. Etheridge, whose company installs solar panels and helps ensure buildings are energy efficient, was among many in the sector to lobby Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina for changes in the bill.

Tillis ultimately was one of three Republicans to vote against the measure, but in a sign of Trump’s power over legislators to pass it, Tillis said he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump said he’d likely support a primary challenger.

Now, Etheridge says losing the tax credit will likely mean laying off 50 to 55 of his workers. He called the elimination of residential tax credits a “bait and switch.”

“I made a decision from being an employee to taking out a loan from my grandmother to buy into my business and put my house on the line,” in part because of the stability of the tax credits, he said. He said he’ll scramble now to figure out ways to diversify his business.

“If you require a money-spigot from Washington to make your business viable, it probably shouldn’t have been in business in the first place,” said Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

‘I’m panicked’: Medicaid, food aid recipients worry about safety net cuts in Trump tax law

Michel said he doubted many clean energy companies would go out of business, but “I think that they will be right sized for the market and that the people that are employed with them will find better jobs and more stable jobs in industries that are actually viable and don’t require billions of dollars of federal subsidies.”

Even ahead of debate over the bill, experts at E2 said in May that $14 billion in clean energy investments across the country had been postponed or cancelled this year.

The bill the Senate passed last week removes a tax on some wind and solar projects that was proposed in a previous version and gives utility-scale projects some time to begin construction before phasing out those tax credits.

Karl Stupka, president of Raleigh-based NC Solar Now that employs about 100 people, said the Senate’s bill eased the impact on commercial projects “while destroying the residential portion of the tax credits.” Roughly 85% of his business is residential work.

“They took it away from every average American normal person and gave it to the wealthier business owners,” he said.

Stupka said if the bill becomes law, companies will rush to finish as many solar jobs as they can before the credit ends. He expected to lay off half his employees, with “trickle-down” job losses elsewhere.

“It would cause a pretty severe shock wave,” he said.

Dublin, July 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""U.S. Power Rental Market - Strategic Assessment & Forecast 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The U.S. Power Rental Market was valued at USD 5.30 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 8.27 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 7.70%.

The U.S. power rental market is dominated by major players such as United Rentals, Sunbelt Rentals, Herc Rentals, and Home Depot. These companies hold significant U.S. power rental market share due to extensive fleets, nationwide presence, and strong brand recognition. Beyond the major players, the market includes many regional and local rental companies. These smaller firms often compete on price, customer service, or specialization in niche sectors (e.g., events, construction, or emergency services).

Growing environmental regulations and customer demand for sustainability are driving competition toward hybrid generators, battery storage, and lower-emission equipment. Companies offering green or Tier 4 Final-compliant equipment are gaining favor in the U.S. power rental market. The U.S. power rental market has experienced significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in recent years, with companies actively expanding their power rental capabilities. In 2025, Herc Holdings completed the acquisition of H&E Equipment Services, further expanding its equipment rental portfolio and market reach. This strategic move strengthens Herc's position in the construction and industrial sectors.

The Southern U.S. holds the largest share of the U.S. power rental market. States like Texas, Florida, and Georgia have significant construction, oil & gas, and manufacturing activities that drive demand for power rentals. Large infrastructure developments, including power plants, commercial buildings, and data centers, increase rental needs. Furthermore, the West holds a significant share, reflecting strong activity, especially in states like California, Washington, and Colorado. Renewable energy projects (solar, wind) and mining operations contribute to the demand for mobile power solutions. Wildfires and droughts create demand for emergency power solutions.

The Midwest remains a manufacturing powerhouse requiring temporary power for maintenance, shutdowns, and expansions. Large-scale construction projects (e.g., energy infrastructure projects, highways, bridges) often require temporary power solutions. Furthermore, the Northeast's industrial sector needs backup and supplemental power to avoid production downtime. Large-scale events, festivals, concerts, and sports events require mobile power solutions, especially in urban centers.

US POWER RENTAL MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS

Shift Toward Clean and Hybrid Solutions

Innovations in energy storage are revolutionizing portable power, making it more efficient and more sustainable. Leading the transformation are battery energy storage systems (BESS). A BESS paired with a mobile power generator forms a hybrid power solution that produces lower emissions or zero emissions and consumes significantly less fuel. For instance, Aggreko provides 100 kW Tier 4F Generator Rental, with innovative features that reduce regulated emissions (NOx, CO, VOCs) to near-zero levels, reduce fuel usage and costs, arc Flash detection and physical safety barriers to provide safety to the operators, and more.

Rise in Infrastructure Development

The surge in infrastructure development in the U.S. is driving demand for temporary power solutions in construction and industrial projects, particularly in remote or underserved areas. As projects like roads, bridges, and urban development expand, flexible and reliable power rental options are essential for meeting energy needs.

For instance, in January 2025, OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are investing up to $500 billion in the Stargate initiative to build 10 to 20 large-scale U.S. data centers, aiming to support AI infrastructure. This project is expected to drive significant growth in the data center and construction industries. These facilities often require substantial and continuous power supply, leading to a higher reliance on power rental services to meet their energy needs during peak loads or as backup solutions.

INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS

Fluctuating Fuel Prices

Gasoline is the most common fuel source for portable generators. A standard 5-kilowatt generator will typically consume about 0.75 gallons per hour. The portable generator for a day, that would consume about 18 gallons, meaning the cost to run the generator would be more than $52 a day. The price of gas does fluctuate, which can make running this type of portable generator expensive over a prolonged period. Fluctuating diesel prices directly impact the U.S. power rental market, which depends heavily on diesel generators.

INSIGHTS BY FUEL

Diesel has the highest incremental opportunity in the U.S. power rental market and is preferred over other fuels as it is more easily available. Despite reservations and resistance from environmental groups, regulators and localities are reluctantly approving diesel generators because of the current grid realities - specifically, the lack of reliable renewable infrastructure, limited energy storage capacity, and the urgent need for dependable backup power during peak loads or grid instability. Furthermore, other segments are gaining traction with an increase in power generation through renewable sources to enhance clean energy practices.

INSIGHTS BY POWER RATING

In 2024, the above 1,000 kVA segment accounted for 40% of the revenue share in the U.S. power rental market. The increasing need for reliable, high-capacity power solutions in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and large-scale events has fueled demand for powerful rental generators capable of supporting heavy machinery and critical operations.

Additionally, the growing emphasis on backup power systems for data centers, hospitals, and commercial buildings amid rising concerns over grid reliability and natural disasters has further boosted the uptake of high-capacity units. Furthermore, infrastructure development projects and expanding urbanization require robust and scalable power solutions, which are often met by rental generators above 1000 kVA due to their flexibility and cost-efficiency compared to permanent installations.

INSIGHTS BY EQUIPMENT

In 2024, generators dominated the equipment segment in the U.S. power rental market. The increasing frequency of power outages and natural disasters has heightened the need for reliable backup power solutions across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. Additionally, rapid infrastructure development and ongoing construction projects require temporary power sources, further boosting generator rentals.

The growing adoption of renewable energy sources, which can sometimes lead to grid instability, also increases reliance on generators for a consistent power supply. Moreover, businesses aiming to minimize downtime and maintain operations during maintenance or unexpected power failures are increasingly turning to generator rentals as a flexible and cost-effective solution.

INSIGHTS BY END USER

The construction end-user segment in the U.S. power rental market is the fastest-growing segment, exhibiting the highest CAGR of more than 7.9% during the forecast period. This robust growth is primarily driven by increasing infrastructure development projects, urbanization, and the expansion of residential and commercial construction activities across the country.

The growing emphasis on sustainable and efficient construction practices also fuels the demand for modern, energy-efficient power rental equipment. Additionally, the rise in government investments targeting infrastructure upgrades and disaster recovery initiatives further propels the demand for temporary and reliable power sources in construction projects.

INSIGHTS BY APPLICATION

In 2024, standby power solutions accounted for a significant 45% share of revenue within the application segment of the U.S. power rental market. Increasingly stringent regulations on power reliability and uptime across critical industries such as healthcare, data centers, and manufacturing have heightened the need for reliable backup power systems.

The expanding adoption of digital infrastructure and the rise of remote work have further underscored the importance of a consistent power supply, fueling the demand for standby generators.

Then, on Sept. 27, 2024, the storm surged up the spine of the Appalachians and flattened swaths of western North Carolina.
Last September he had just returned to North Carolina from several meetings with global experts on climate change and health.","CHAPEL HILL, N.C.—Perched above the Bolin Creek Trail, 46,000 tons of coal ash appeared to be intact Monday afternoon, the mound’s slopes anchored by bushes and vines.

But at the foot of the ash pile outside its fence, the force of the floodwaters from Tropical Depression Chantal had evicted large trees from the banks of the nearby creek. Rocks larger than bowling balls had caromed off one another. A dead crawdad lay on the trail, washed out from the creek. The air smelled vaguely of sewage.

Early Sunday morning, Tropical Storm Chantal had blown ashore in South Carolina, and by the time it meandered into central North Carolina, it had weakened to a tropical depression.

But by nightfall the impacts felt akin to a hurricane: 5 to 10 inches of rain fell within 12 hours.

Dams burst. Interstates closed. Roads washed away. The Haw River reached historic levels, rising as much as 22 feet in four hours, engulfing parts of Saxapahaw. Hillsborough officials advised residents to boil their water after parts of the treatment plant flooded. More than 17,000 Duke Energy customers lost power.

Eighty people who live along the Eno River in Durham had to be rescued, and another 63 were displaced in Chapel Hill. First responders had to conduct 13 water rescues near Southern Pines. One elderly woman in Chatham County died when her car became trapped in floodwaters.

Storms like Chantal—and Hurricane Helene, which technically had been downgraded to a tropical storm when it devastated western North Carolina last September—are at least in part attributable to a warming world, according to climate scientists.

Warmer air holds more moisture. The 2020 North Carolina Climate Science Report cited a study whose modeling showed an increase in the number of intense hourly rainfall events. North Carolina-based experts concluded that it’s likely severe thunderstorms in central North Carolina will happen more often.

Durham is already experiencing more extreme storms and precipitation events, according to the county’s 2023 Community Health Assessment, including a 129 percent increase in heavy precipitation events from 2005 to 2014 compared to the 1950s.

Yet a majority of North Carolina’s state lawmakers seem to ignore the scientific evidence. Two weeks before the storm, the state Senate had joined the House in passing Senate Bill 266, titled “The Power Bill Reduction Act,” that, in addition to providing utilities with financial incentives for natural gas and nuclear energy, would allow Duke Energy to cancel its interim carbon reduction goal of 70 percent by 2030. The utility would still have to achieve net zero by 2050.

Rep. Dean Arp, a Republican from Union County, co-sponsored the bill, with outspoken support from utilities, the American Petroleum Institute, the N.C. Chamber and manufacturing interests. Arp called it a “responsible, prudent bill.”

“People ask, ‘Why not just delay those interim goals instead of repealing them?’” Arp said on the House floor.

For bill opponents, planning is the point, a critical step to reaching net zero. “Our planet’s on fire: hurricanes, storms, wildfires, deadly heat, droughts, crazy weather,” said state Rep. Pricey Harrison, a Democrat from Guilford County.

By eliminating the interim goal, it will be more difficult to achieve net zero by 2050, she said.

Senate Bill 266, coupled with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed rollbacks of greenhouse gas rules, will give North Carolina utilities carte blanche to pump millions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane into the air. The power plants’ emissions will accelerate the pace of climate change with near certainty.

“Science is unforgiving,” said Rep. Abe Jones, a Wake County Democrat. “This bill isn’t smart or realistic. Nature will have its way.”

Helene’s Survivors and Climate Trauma

Nine months ago, Colleen Daly eyed the floodwaters that surrounded her apartment complex south of Asheville.

The day before, Hurricane Helene had made landfall in Florida. Then, on Sept. 27, 2024, the storm surged up the spine of the Appalachians and flattened swaths of western North Carolina.

Yet even as the floodwaters rose, Daly believed the storm’s ferocity would soon pass.

We’ll be on this island, she thought, but we’re going to be OK.

Daly soon met a woman who had sought refuge in the apartment building. The electricity was out. No one had cell phone service or running water.

“‘I came here thinking there would be power,’” Daly said the woman told her. “‘I came here thinking that I could use my machine, that there might be extra oxygen. I don’t have any oxygen left.’”

Daly said her husband and a neighbor swam a quarter of a mile to the Fletcher fire station, where they got an oxygen tank. They swam back, she said, holding it over their heads as the water continued to pour in.

Daly told her story one evening in mid-June at a People’s Hearing, held in Asheville at the Highland Brewery Event Center, an airy, vaulted room illuminated by sunbeams bending through wide windows and overhead strings of retro Edison bulbs.

Against a backdrop of purple, red and white signs that read “People Over Polluters” and “Stop EPA’s Climate Chaos,” two dozen hurricane survivors, local officials and environmental advocates gathered on stage to testify about the trauma they experienced during Helene and the historic storm’s connection to climate change.

Event organizers recorded the testimony to send it to the EPA. Earlier this year, on what EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described as “a historic day at the EPA,” he formally proposed two regulatory repeals for power plants, Inside Climate News reported at the time: the end of greenhouse gas rules and mercury and air toxics regulations.

The economic benefits to the fossil fuel industry would total $20 billion over the next two decades, Zeldin said.

Yet that figure is dwarfed by the estimated costs of Helene’s destruction in western North Carolina alone, according to state officials—$60 billion—and the years of recovery that lie ahead.

“The testifiers are here to demonstrate that they are proof that climate change is a real threat,” said Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, “and we need more protections from climate pollution, not less.”

In North Carolina, eliminating the interim carbon reduction goal would save ratepayers $13 billion, bill supporters said. Senate Bill 266 would also permit Duke Energy to pass the financing costs of new natural gas and nuclear plants to its customers, with permission from the N.C. Utilities Commission. This would save $1.5 billion in future interest, bill sponsors said.

An analysis written by three N.C. State University environmental engineering professors contradicts that figure. They estimated removing the interim target would not reduce power bills, but instead could cost ratepayers up to $23 billion in added fuel expenses over the same time.

Companies would increase natural gas generation by nearly 40 percent between 2030 and 2050, the analysis suggested, and those fuel costs are expected to rise.

Demand for gas turbines has increased their cost by twofold, according to S&P Global, and wait times can range from one to seven years.

“I can’t overstate how removing our carbon goal is not a good idea,” said Harrison, the representative from Guilford County. “This bill promotes natural gas and nuclear at the expense of cleaner energy sources. It’s not balancing environmental goals.”

Bill supporters are justifying a massive fossil fuel infrastructure buildout happening in North Carolina to meet the energy demands from massive server farms called data centers needed to power energy-hungry AI applications and crypto mines.

Zeldin, the EPA administrator, has also cited data centers to justify the need for fossil fuels. “Coal and natural gas power plants are essential sources of baseload power that are needed to fuel manufacturing and turn the United States into the Artificial Intelligence capital of the world,” Zeldin said in a press statement.

Data centers often operate in secrecy, making it difficult to know where they plan to locate and to ascertain the amount of energy they use.

Microsoft required Person County officials to sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of the county’s sale of a 1,350-acre megasite to the tech company. The land is adjacent to where Duke Energy plans to build two new natural gas plants and Enbridge intends to construct a new eight-mile segment of natural gas pipeline.

Neither Microsoft nor the county has announced what will be built on the tract, but a legislative presentation by the American Petroleum Institute earlier this year listed it as a data center.

The Costs People Bear

An hour before the People’s Hearing, it began to rain. So intense was the deluge that a car’s windshield wipers could not keep pace with the torrents. From Black Mountain through Swannanoa into East Asheville, mud pooled around mounds of debris that over the past six months had been extracted from the riverbed.

Near the North Carolina-Tennessee border, flash flooding triggered a new landslide that closed a segment of Interstate 40, which had only recently re-opened after Helene.

Suddenly the skies cleared. The sunlight took on an amber hue. Thunderheads the color of a deep bruise marched east.

As a baby, Brian Campbell was baptized along Black Creek at the headwaters of the Swannanoa River. Years later, he married his wife there.

“This valley has always been a place that’s felt safest and most like home,” Campbell said at the People’s Hearing.

Campbell is the executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility. Last September he had just returned to North Carolina from several meetings with global experts on climate change and health.

Shortly before midnight, he awoke to heavy rain and wind and, he said, “to the low hum of the Swannanoa River, which I’d never heard before. This normally quiet stream was now churning.”

His family and several neighbors walked down a hill. They stood in silence and watched as whitewater crews rescued unhoused people from a rooftop alongside the MANNA FoodBank, which was engulfed in water, Campbell said.

“We know climate change has real and devastating consequences, and we know the only way to solve this is through strong local, state and federal leadership,” Campbell said. “The EPA must do its part regulating carbon and other harmful emissions. And we must protect federal investments in clean energy, in health care and health research and environmental justice and in community recovery and resilience. These policies and investments save lives, and we refuse to sit quietly while they’re under attack.”

Senate Bill 266 is not yet law. On July 2, Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed it.

“This bill not only makes everyone’s utility bills more expensive but it shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people,” Stein wrote in his veto message. “This bill walks back our state’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be part of our clean economy.”

A few Democrats joined Republican lawmakers in supporting the bill. If that margin holds, there will be enough votes for an override.

On Monday, the day after Tropical Depression Chantal reminded far too many North Carolinians of previous hurricanes, workmen with chainsaws sliced up trees that had fallen across highways, business owners mucked out storefronts and tow trucks hauled away soaked cars. Over 15,000 people were still without power as temperatures soared into the 90s.

The details: The EV startup (backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos) has nixed its ""under $20,000"" marketing promo for the truck days before President Trump signed the sweeping tax bill into law, killing the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, reports TechCrunch. While Slate has not released official pricing for the pickup (which goes into production in 2026), the end of the federal tax credits is clearly a blow to the startup's market strategy.

For context: The startup had promoted the sub-$20,000 price point heavily since emerging from stealth mode in April, with the company receiving over 100,000 reservations within two weeks of unveiling the truck. Slate's business model centers on a radically minimalist approach—selling a bare-bones electric truck as a ""blank slate"" that customers can customize with bolt-on features.

❝

Why it matters: Eliminating federal EV tax credits will impact nearly every mass-market electric vehicle, but for Slate specifically, the timing is challenging. The company has positioned itself as the solution to an industry that has ""driven prices to a place that most Americans simply can't afford,"" according to chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder. Now, living up to that promise will be more challenging.

Between the lines: If Slate prices its pickup around $25,000 without tax credits, it could still have an advantage in the EV market.

EV purchase price remains a major buyer concern—59% cite cost as a key barrier in a recent AAA study.

As of March, only one electric vehicle was priced under $30,000 before incentives—the Nissan Leaf.

Tariffs could create pricing challenges for Kia as it expands its affordable EV lineup in the U.S.

The minimalist gamble: Slate's base model includes only essentials: single gray color, two seats, flatbed, steering wheel, and basic battery gauge. Everything else costs extra, from paint and power windows to infotainment and speakers. Customers can even convert the truck into an SUV using removable roof panels.

Bottom line: Slate's pivot tests whether consumers were drawn to the vehicle itself or just the headline price. With Tesla and legacy automakers moving toward sub-$30,000 EVs that aren't bare-bones, Slate must prove its customizable approach can compete without federal subsidies. Whether customers will pay $25,000+ for a truck they’ll need to “DIY,” remains the ultimate question.

Growing environmental regulations and customer demand for sustainability are driving competition toward hybrid generators, battery storage, and lower-emission equipment. Companies offering green or Tier 4 Final-compliant equipment are gaining favor in the U.S. power rental market. The U.S. power rental market has experienced significant merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in recent years, with companies actively expanding their power rental capabilities. In 2025, Herc Holdings completed the acquisition of H&E Equipment Services, further expanding its equipment rental portfolio and market reach. This strategic move strengthens Herc's position in the construction and industrial sectors.

The Southern U.S. holds the largest share of the U.S. power rental market. States like Texas, Florida, and Georgia have significant construction, oil & gas, and manufacturing activities that drive demand for power rentals. Large infrastructure developments, including power plants, commercial buildings, and data centers, increase rental needs. Furthermore, the West holds a significant share, reflecting strong activity, especially in states like California, Washington, and Colorado. Renewable energy projects (solar, wind) and mining operations contribute to the demand for mobile power solutions. Wildfires and droughts create demand for emergency power solutions.

The Midwest remains a manufacturing powerhouse requiring temporary power for maintenance, shutdowns, and expansions. Large-scale construction projects (e.g., energy infrastructure projects, highways, bridges) often require temporary power solutions. Furthermore, the Northeast's industrial sector needs backup and supplemental power to avoid production downtime. Large-scale events, festivals, concerts, and sports events require mobile power solutions, especially in urban centers.

US POWER RENTAL MARKET TRENDS & DRIVERS

Shift Toward Clean and Hybrid Solutions

Innovations in energy storage are revolutionizing portable power, making it more efficient and more sustainable. Leading the transformation are battery energy storage systems (BESS). A BESS paired with a mobile power generator forms a hybrid power solution that produces lower emissions or zero emissions and consumes significantly less fuel. For instance, Aggreko provides 100 kW Tier 4F Generator Rental, with innovative features that reduce regulated emissions (NOx, CO, VOCs) to near-zero levels, reduce fuel usage and costs, arc Flash detection and physical safety barriers to provide safety to the operators, and more.

Rise in Infrastructure Development

The surge in infrastructure development in the U.S. is driving demand for temporary power solutions in construction and industrial projects, particularly in remote or underserved areas. As projects like roads, bridges, and urban development expand, flexible and reliable power rental options are essential for meeting energy needs.

For instance, in January 2025, OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle are investing up to $500 billion in the Stargate initiative to build 10 to 20 large-scale U.S. data centers, aiming to support AI infrastructure. This project is expected to drive significant growth in the data center and construction industries. These facilities often require substantial and continuous power supply, leading to a higher reliance on power rental services to meet their energy needs during peak loads or as backup solutions.

INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS

Fluctuating Fuel Prices

Gasoline is the most common fuel source for portable generators. A standard 5-kilowatt generator will typically consume about 0.75 gallons per hour. The portable generator for a day, that would consume about 18 gallons, meaning the cost to run the generator would be more than $52 a day. The price of gas does fluctuate, which can make running this type of portable generator expensive over a prolonged period. Fluctuating diesel prices directly impact the U.S. power rental market, which depends heavily on diesel generators.

INSIGHTS BY FUEL

Diesel has the highest incremental opportunity in the U.S. power rental market and is preferred over other fuels as it is more easily available. Despite reservations and resistance from environmental groups, regulators and localities are reluctantly approving diesel generators because of the current grid realities - specifically, the lack of reliable renewable infrastructure, limited energy storage capacity, and the urgent need for dependable backup power during peak loads or grid instability. Furthermore, other segments are gaining traction with an increase in power generation through renewable sources to enhance clean energy practices.

This mismatch has increased the risk of a potential twofold increase in blackouts by 2030.
The latest warning came earlier this year, with NERC attributing the danger to the surge in demand for electricity.
Meanwhile, a proliferation in wind and solar capacity has made the grid less stable and electricity supply less reliable, the grid watchdog said.
However, just 22 GW of that 104 GW will come from baseload facilities, which is too little to ensure grid stability, the DoE said.","The U.S. Department of Energy has warned that blackouts could increase substantially in the coming years unless more baseload capacity is added to the grid.

The department issued its warning in a report that said the premature retirement of generation capacity and the delay in replacing that capacity with new baseload facilities had created a mismatch between demand and supply. This mismatch has increased the risk of a potential twofold increase in blackouts by 2030.

“This report affirms what we already know: The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

“In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,” Wright added, saying the Trump administration would ensure that supply by focusing on “all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure.”

The North American Reliability Corp. has been warning of blackouts for two years now, citing extreme temperatures but also increased reliance on weather-dependent sources of electricity, notably wind and solar installations. The latest warning came earlier this year, with NERC attributing the danger to the surge in demand for electricity. The surge, in turn, was driven by the proliferation of data centers, which consume enormous amounts of electricity.

Meanwhile, a proliferation in wind and solar capacity has made the grid less stable and electricity supply less reliable, the grid watchdog said.

“With higher demand and less firm resources,” NERC said in June, the grid “is at elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand or low resource output.”

The current management of the DoE expects new capacity additions of some 209 GW by 2030, replacing 104 GW of retired capacity. However, just 22 GW of that 104 GW will come from baseload facilities, which is too little to ensure grid stability, the DoE said.

This surge is largely fueled by the rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), stringent vehicle safety regulations, and rising consumer demand for advanced driver-assist technologies.

An electrical park brake is a modern alternative to the traditional mechanical handbrake, utilizing electronic actuators and control systems to engage and release the parking brake automatically or at the push of a button. In addition to improving cabin space and aesthetics, EPBs are often integrated with critical safety features such as hill-start assist, emergency braking, and even autonomous driving systems, making them an essential component in next-gen vehicles.

Key Market Drivers: Safety, Innovation, and Electrification

The adoption of EPBs has become increasingly widespread in passenger vehicles and commercial fleets, especially in the wake of new regulations in Europe. In 2024, a major regulatory shift—mandating EPBs on all new commercial vehicles in the EU—went into effect under amended ECE R13 guidelines, significantly accelerating market demand. The regulation, initiated by Germany and adopted EU-wide in 2023, requires automatic handbrakes in electric braking systems to prevent rollaway incidents and improve road safety.

Shift in Vehicle Architecture

As automakers race to meet decarbonization goals and integrate smart mobility technologies, EPB systems are proving crucial. The caliper integrated system segment, in particular, is expected to witness exceptional growth due to its compact design, improved efficiency, and compatibility with lightweight vehicle platforms.

The OEM segment dominates the market by sales channel, with manufacturers increasingly opting to embed EPBs in factory models to comply with safety regulations and consumer preferences. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific region is projected to lead in global EPB adoption, driven by rapid automotive innovation, urbanization, and government initiatives in electrification.

Technological Advancements Powering Growth

Continuous R&D investments and collaborations with OEMs have led to the emergence of more intelligent, space-saving, and user-friendly EPB systems. Manufacturers like ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Continental AG, Hyundai Mobis, and Aisin Seiki are investing in technologies that support future-ready mobility ecosystems. These innovations enhance not only the convenience and performance of EPBs but also their integration with AI-based vehicle diagnostics and predictive safety systems.

Market Challenges

Despite the bright outlook, high production and maintenance costs remain barriers, especially in price-sensitive markets. However, these challenges are expected to be mitigated as mass adoption, platform standardization, and economies of scale reduce costs over time.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-08 08:37:50+00:00,ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office - AMRO ASIA,China's Renewable Surge: Unlocking the Next Phase of Decarbonization,Andrea Abellon,,,,,https://amro-asia.org/chinas-renewable-surge-unlocking-the-next-phase-of-decarbonization,"China is rapidly emerging as the world’s leading force in renewable energy development.
As a result, grid limitations are increasingly hindering renewable electricity from reaching end users.
In parallel, deeper reforms in China’s power sector can help ensure clean energy generated is delivered efficiently and fairly.
In the first quarter of 2025, the increase in China’s renewable electricity generation outpaced the growth in overall power demand.
If this trend continues, China’s power sector emissions could peak this year—a major milestone on the path to reach its 2030 and 2060 climate goals.","China stands at a pivotal point in its climate transition journey. While the road to carbon neutrality remains long and demanding, the country’s rapid and remarkable progress in renewable energy deployment has already started to transform its emissions profile. The key challenge now is to sustain this momentum through deeper decarbonization, especially by tackling key infrastructure and policy constraints.

Between 2020 and 2024, China experienced strong growth in both energy consumption and carbon emissions, even as overall economic growth slowed. Energy consumption rose by 4.7 percent annually on average, while emissions grew by 3.9 percent, both growing faster than in the preceding five years. These trends have put pressure on meeting China’s interim climate targets under the 14th Five-Year Plan, as energy and carbon intensity reductions are both lagging behind schedule.

At the core of this dynamic is surging electricity demand. As sectors such as transportation and manufacturing accelerate electrification, electricity consumption has risen by nearly 7 percent annually in recent years. The power and transport sectors now account for most of the country’s emissions growth, while industrial emissions—particularly from steel and cement—have stabilized due to the ongoing property market adjustment.

Yet, amid this challenge lies a powerful opportunity. China is rapidly emerging as the world’s leading force in renewable energy development. In 2023 and 2024, China added a combined 649 gigawatts of new solar and wind capacity, representing around 60 percent of total global additions. Since 2020, its installed solar and wind capacity has tripled. The electricity generated by renewables reached 1,830 terawatt-hours in 2024, roughly equivalent to the total electricity consumption of China’s entire tertiary sector.

However, the growth in clean power generation has not fully kept pace with the rapid expansion in installed capacity, and fossil fuels—especially coal—remain a critical backstop for meeting China’s soaring electricity demand. Between 2021 and 2024, approximately 45 percent of incremental power consumption was met by coal or other fossil fuel-based generation.

This presents a paradox: despite record growth in installed renewables capacity, reliance on fossil generation remains substantial.

The main constraint is inadequate transmission infrastructure. Many renewable resources are concentrated in remote inland provinces, far from coastal areas which have high power demand, creating geographical imbalances in supply and demand. In contrast to the rapid expansion of renewable generation, investment in power transmission has also been lagging, with total power sector investment falling from 66 percent in 2018 to just 35 percent in 2023.

As a result, grid limitations are increasingly hindering renewable electricity from reaching end users. Curtailment rates for wind and solar, i.e. the proportion of generated electricity that was wasted or not dispatched due to grid limitations or oversupply, have risen in the past two years, signaling that transmission capacity is struggling to keep pace with generation. Without a stronger grid backbone, much of China’s clean energy potential remains underutilized.

Addressing this challenge will require stepped-up investment in ultra high-voltage transmission lines, smart grid technologies, and energy storage solutions to enhance flexibility and manage intermittency.

Integrating renewables into grid operations is a necessary first step, but doing that alone would not be sufficient. The recent Spain–Portugal blackout highlights the operational risks associated with rising renewable penetration. To enhance overall grid resilience and ensure system stability, China must also invest in advanced voltage control, synthetic inertia, distributed energy storage, and stronger inter-regional transmission links, gradually reducing its reliance on fossil backup.

In parallel, deeper reforms in China’s power sector can help ensure clean energy generated is delivered efficiently and fairly. Building a truly integrated national electricity market—through the development of real-time and spot trading platforms, greater regional interconnection, and more flexible electricity pricing—will be essential to maximize the value of clean power. Reforming dispatch protocols to prioritize low-carbon generation and fostering competition across provincial boundaries can further accelerate the green transition.

The good news is that the turning point may be near. In the first quarter of 2025, the increase in China’s renewable electricity generation outpaced the growth in overall power demand. If this trend continues, China’s power sector emissions could peak this year—a major milestone on the path to reach its 2030 and 2060 climate goals.

Today, China’s clean energy transformation is already reshaping the global energy system. Its next phase—which is set to emphasize on integration, efficiency, and reform—will determine how quickly and effectively the transformation leads to sustaining emissions reductions.

If China can align its infrastructure and institutions with the pace of its renewable expansion, the country will not only meet its climate targets, but also set a new global benchmark for how to scale decarbonization in a fast-growing, energy-hungry economy.",https://amro-asia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/07/Chinas-Renewable-Surge-Unlocking-the-Next-Phase-of-Decarbonization.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 10:12:59.700380

The Biden law extended tax credits through 2032 for large clean energy projects, residential energy-saving improvements, electric vehicles and charging stations.
Since nonprofits received access to the tax credits in 2023, roughly half of Catholic Energies' clients have opted to utilize them to reduce costs of clean energy projects.
In April, he took part in a rally opposing the elimination of the clean energy tax credits.","Catholic parishes, schools and houses of worship across the country pursuing wind and solar projects were dealt a major financial blow in President Donald Trump's domestic-policy and tax-cut bill signed into law on July 4.

The law curtails federal spending for renewable energy, cutting off a major funding source that many faith-based organizations have tapped to make their projects more affordable. Among the impacted projects are a multimillion dollar plan to put solar panels on schools throughout the Archdiocese of Los Angeles as well as the first solar installation on a school in a Florida diocese.

""It's just making projects more expensive,"" said Page Gravely, who heads the Catholic Climate Covenant's Catholic Energies program that assists church organizations on solar and other energy installations.

A piece of the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act,"" narrowly passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, effectively ends for now a Biden-era program called ""direct pay"" that for the first time allowed tax-exempt organizations and religious institutions to take advantage of clean energy tax credits through a cash payment received from the IRS. The tax credits reduce costs of an energy project through money coming back as a government payment.

When the program first began in 2023, it was touted as a ""game changer"" for faith communities in particular, and delivered a long-time goal of faith organizations for federal assistance with energy projects. The U.S. Catholic bishops' conference for years has lobbied Congress for such financial support.

The credits Congress has now eliminated would reduce the costs of clean energy investments like solar arrays, wind farms, battery storage and geothermal systems by at least 30%. The savings could have risen to as much as half the cost of the project if it meets other factors, such as using union labor or building in a low-income area.

What the Big, Beautiful Bill Act eliminates

Clean energy tax credits eliminated in the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act were first enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

That law represented the U.S.'s largest investment to address climate change, allocating more than $300 billion clean energy projects over a decade. It was designed to meet the U.S. target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 Paris Agreement and was seen as an environmental milestone.

The Biden law extended tax credits through 2032 for large clean energy projects, residential energy-saving improvements, electric vehicles and charging stations.

Trump’s big bill phases out tax credits for environmental projects, including electric vehicles (in September) and home-energy efficiency improvements and electric vehicle charging stations (at the end of 2025).

The ""direct pay"" incentives for religious groups were based on the tax credits that the Trump law eliminates. With those tax credits eliminated, so will the ""direct pay"" incentives. Those incentives were paid to tax-exempt organizations in the form of a check from the Internal Revenue Service; the checks were the same value that an individual might have received in the form of a tax refund for using the same program.

At Sacred Heart Catholic Church, in northern Omaha, the parish completed two solar projects in the past 18 months that still qualified for the tax credits. It expects to receive cash payments of $18,000 for the 24-kilowatt system ($45,000 cost) on its office building and $70,500 for the 70-kilowatt solar array that cost $235,000 to install at the parish school.

""We could not have afforded that without the direct pay program,"" pastor Fr. David Korth said.

While President Donald Trump's new law leaves the direct pay program untouched, the tax credits for solar and wind developments are now only available for projects that begin construction within one year of the bill's enactment; all other projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. Other projects like geothermal and battery storage must begin construction by the end of 2033.

The law also places new restrictions on the tax credits, for instance, barring materials for clean energy projects from ""prohibited foreign entities,"" which widely refers to China.

The actions by Congress come even as nearly 60% of clean energy spending from the Inflation Reduction Act has occurred in Republican-held congressional districts.

The dismantling of federal climate policies follows Trump's second withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and other efforts by his administration to wipe out climate and environmental programs.

The Republican legislation ""is a very, very bad bill for clean energy,"" said Jack Pratt, senior political director with the Environmental Defense Fund.

Religious groups urged to act fast or lose funding

Pratt said the law is especially a blow for religious organizations and nonprofits looking at energy upgrades for moral and economic reasons but may lack funds for expensive upfront costs.

""If you're a smaller entity, then you really are reliant on these incentives to help you overcome that first hurdle, even for something that's paid off over several years,"" Pratt said.

As it followed the legislation's developments, Catholic Energies encouraged church organizations considering solar to make decisions in the next 90 days in order to utilize the federal energy credits.

""There is a sense of urgency,"" Gravely said. ""We're just telling clients that you got to act if you're really serious about solar and you want to optimize"" a project's finances with the federal energy credits.

Since nonprofits received access to the tax credits in 2023, roughly half of Catholic Energies' clients have opted to utilize them to reduce costs of clean energy projects. Often, those savings not only have helped lower bills but have allowed churches and schools to redirect more funds toward ministries serving their communities.

The Los Angeles Archdiocese is partnering with Catholic Energies for a multimillion dollar project that would initially install solar arrays at nearly two dozen of its 240 schools. The loss of federal energy credits is expected to result in millions of dollars less in energy cost savings that the archdiocese could otherwise reinvest in teachers and Catholic education.

Another Catholic Energies project in the works would construct the first solar installation for one Florida diocese, where the energy tax credits would reduce costs by at least $450,000. The savings available through federal incentives made the project's economics more attractive because Florida is one of at least six states that bars power purchase agreements, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency. In a power purchase agreement, a third-party developer pays for the solar array, while claiming any tax benefits, and then sells the power from the system to the customer, often at a lower, fixed rate.

The final text of Trump's domestic agenda law mostly took aim at tax incentives for solar and wind developments. An earlier draft in the House sought to eliminate all clean energy tax credits for all projects not under construction within 60 days of it becoming law, and requiring they be placed in service by the end of 2028.

Those terms could have spelled trouble for the Sisters of St. Benedict, who are in the process of constructing a 200-well geothermal system to heat and cool some of its oldest buildings at Monastery Immaculate Conception, in Ferdinand, Indiana.

The $10 million project, begun in 2024 and set to complete in 2026, was initially financed on their own through donors and a bank loan. The sisters said they planned to apply for the federal tax credit, which could save $3 million-$4 million. If the credit was lost, they would be forced to tap into savings set aside for the sisters' retirements.

In Omaha, Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls Catholic high school, has planned to apply for an energy tax credit to offset a portion of its own $2 million geothermal system that is set to finish construction in summer 2026.

""We're just trying to do the right thing for the world,"" Meg Brudney, Duchesne head of school, said.

An economic and moral loss

Before Trump signed the law July 4, Archbishop Timothy Broglio, the president of the U.S. bishops' conference, criticized its ""devastating effects,"" including cuts to programs protecting God's creation.

""Vulnerable communities will be less prepared to cope with environmental impacts of pollution and extreme weather,"" he said in a July 3 statement.

Earlier, Broglio warned in a letter to Congress that the bill's clean energy and environmental cuts would harm both God's creation and future generations.

Another letter from bishops to senators also decried the reductions.

""Cuts will also lead to increased pollution that harms children and the unborn, stifles economic opportunity, and decreases resilience against extreme weather,"" the bishops wrote. ""These changes will also discourage clean energy companies from investing in or continuing operations.""

Members of Catholic Climate Covenant in late June delivered copies of Pope Francis' 2015 encyclical ""Laudato Si', on Care for Our Common Home,"" to every Catholic member of Congress, including Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who along with five other senators sought some protections of the energy tax credits in the bill.

It was from reading Laudato Si' a decade ago that Korth, the pastor at Sacred Heart and member of the Omaha Archdiocese's Laudato Si' commission, felt compelled to move to renewable power, but only if it made financial sense for his parish and school in one of Omaha's poorest zip codes, already facing a tight budget.

In April, he took part in a rally opposing the elimination of the clean energy tax credits. While projects at his parish are complete, the Omaha Archdiocese viewed the federal credits as a means of financing its own plans to expand solar power across its hundreds of buildings.

FAIRFIELD, CA / ACCESS Newswire / July 7, 2025 / Waste Energy Corp (""Waste Energy"" or the ""Company""), (OTCQB:WAST), an emerging leader in sustainable waste-to-energy innovation, today announced it has signed a long-term lease-with an option to purchase nearly four acres of Industrial property in Midland, Texas. The property will host the company's first Waste to Energy conversion system and will serve as the new Waste Energy corporate headquarters.

""Texas generates, refines, and consumes more diesel than any other state in America, giving us unrivaled proximity to feedstock, fuel buyers, and logistics,"" said Scott Gallagher, Chairman & CEO of Waste Energy Corp. ""Our Midland hub puts us at the center of the nation's rising energy needs-driven by the rapid growth of data centers, electric vehicles, and next-generation technologies-at a time when demand for reliable fuel sources are reaching levels not seen in decades. By converting plastic and tire waste into clean-burning (ULSD)ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, we're not just meeting that demand-we're turning one of the world's biggest environmental problems into a powerful energy solution.""

Why Texas? A Century of Fuel Leadership

Historical scale: Texas' 34 refineries can process nearly 6.3 million barrels per day-about one-third of total U.S. capacity.

Top consumer: The state of Texas consumes more ULSD annually than both California and Florida combined, driven by heavy industry, agriculture and freight.

Permian Basin advantage: Midland offers pipeline, rail and interstate access for both incoming waste feedstock and outgoing refined products.

Surging U.S. Power Demand: A Decade of Unprecedented Growth Ahead

The U.S. is entering a new era of energy demand, driven by the explosive growth of data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), Web3 infrastructure, and the reshoring of industrial development:

The U.S. Department of Energy projects data centers alone could consume up to 12% of the nation's electricity by 2028, up from 4.4% in 2023.

Goldman Sachs estimates global data center power use will rise by 50% by 2027, fueled by next-gen computing needs.

McKinsey forecasts U.S. data center demand will more than triple to 80 gigawatts by 2030.

In Texas, grid operator ERCOT expects peak power demand to nearly double by 2031, driven by large-scale digital and industrial expansion.

This wave of demand puts enormous pressure on the grid and creates a critical need for reliable backup power and decentralized diesel fuel sources.

WEC domestically produced fuel supports grid resilience, fuels industrial operations, and turns harmful waste into a vital energy solution.

Are they starting to make a dent in the backlog or timelines in the interconnection queue?
So again, we have this interconnection queue issue that we’ve been talking about, and some of the solutions to that.
We’ve talked about all these challenges with the interconnection queue, downstream with supply chains and permitting, et cetera.","Andy Stone: Welcome to the Energy Policy Now podcast from the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. I’m Andy Stone. The US electric grid is under growing strain. Electricity demand is climbing fast, fueled in part by the rise of AI data centers. At the same time, many aging fossil fuel plants are heading for retirement. As a result, grid operators and regulators have warned that some areas of the US could face a shortfall between power supply and demand.

To meet this challenge, a massive wave of new clean energy and storage projects is lining up to connect to the grid. The interconnection queue, which is the waiting list for these projects, now includes more than twice the capacity of all power plants currently in operation. But the path from proposal to production is anything but easy. The sheer volume of projects has overwhelmed the interconnection process, slowing progress and raising doubts about whether new resources can be brought online quickly enough to keep the grid reliable. And even when projects get the green light, supply chain bottlenecks and potential changes to federal incentives threaten to delay construction and increase costs.

Reforms to the interconnection process are underway, aimed at speeding things up and clearing the backlog. But the question remains, will they work and will they work fast enough? Joining me to explore what’s at stake is Dr. Sarah Toth Kotwis, Senior Associate on the Clean Competitive Grids team at RMI. She focuses on the technical and regulatory barriers to connecting new energy resources to the grid. Sarah, welcome to the podcast.

Sarah Kotwis: Happy to be here.

Stone: So, it is the end of June as we record this episode. And this morning, as I was reading the news, I came across a comment from Mark Christie, who’s the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is this country’s electric grid regulator. And he was talking about the recent heat wave we’ve just gone through in this country, and its impact on the electric grid. And he said— and I’m quoting here— “Some of our systems really came close to the edge,” end quote. With that lead in, can you frame the current grid situation for us? How real is the risk that we’re running short on electricity supply relative to demand, and springing from that whole issue, how urgent is the need to add new sources of power?

Kotwis: Yeah. So, the recent heat wave definitely hit home in some parts of the US, especially the Carolinas region. There were a couple contributing factors to that. I heard that there was a nuclear plant that also went offline. I’m not sure what the reason was, but that also contribute-. You know, power plants unexpectedly going offline contributes to potentially not having enough supply during periods of peak demand.

It’s also a combination of not being able to get enough new resources online to be there just in case other power plants go offline. And so it’s really important to make sure that we have a steady new influx of generation. And making sure that we’re building enough generation to meet future demand, even during peak demand times. That’s a part of planning for resource adequacy. It is one of the three pillars of electric grid reliability to plan in advance and ensure electricity supply can always meet future demand.

Now, I will say that typically in the US, electric reliability is actually pretty high. According to a 2024 NREL report, we typically experience less than five hours of outages per year. That’s around 99.95% reliable. And when there are outages, overwhelmingly, those stem from the distribution system rather than generation or supply side outages.

But that being said, forecasts of increasing demand and all the reasons you mentioned— AI data center projections, electrification of buildings, transportation, industry and more, while constraining supply due to broken generator interconnection processes— causes these resource adequacy concerns and raises prices and brings us closer to the margin than we really should be on the supply side.

Stone: Talking about the supply side—and I guess on the bright side of that— there is a huge volume of mostly clean energy resources that are now waiting to connect to the grid. I wonder if you could introduce the concept of the interconnection queue, which is where this waiting is happening, and why there’s been a rush of new resources to enter it?

Kotwis: Yeah. Largely, the reason for the interconnection queue is that grid operators have to study. There has to be some mechanism by which you get in line and you try to get studied to see if your generator is going to adversely impact the existing US grid. So there’s a lot of modeling and reliability modeling that happens to make sure that the existing grid can handle that additional generation. And so historically, you’re a prospective generator, you have to get in line to get studied, and then maybe you get to connect. So that’s what it’s like in most parts of the US.

The rush has actually been building for a while. It’s not just recently. You can see that over time, annual additions to queue requests have just gone up and up and up for the last few years. And that’s largely due to significant reductions in the cost of new renewable energy resources like solar energy resources, wind energy and battery energy storage resources. So those have all become the most cost-competitive resources out there available to build. And so project developers are seeing that, and they’re also seeing these price signals from our existing markets that, “Hey, we need more new energy entrants into the market to serve resource adequacy.” And so everyone is trying to get in line to be that next project that can come online, contribute to the grid, and also reduce costs.

Stone: So once a new generating project successfully goes through that interconnection queue process, it gets what’s generally known as an interconnection agreement, which is the green light to move forward. But one of the issues here is that, historically, just a fraction of the projects that actually enter the queue successfully get through. Give us an idea. What’s the success rate going through the queue?

Kotwis: There’s a good stat from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab on this subject. It’s a nationwide stat that only about 20% of projects that requested interconnection during 2000 to 2018 reached commercial operations by the end of 2023. So that’s pretty low. And then, more specifically, in PJM— which is the grid operator that started as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, hence PJM, and now includes 13 states plus DC— of the projects that entered their queue between 2014 and 2023, 67% of those withdrew, and 16% are operational, with the remaining in some stage of flux, primarily in engineering and procurement or temporarily suspended.

So there’s three primary drivers for this fairly low success rate. First, it’s about competition. Competition, this is an inherent feature, not a bug of competition, that not all prospective projects are successful. Poorly chosen points of interconnection or costlier build-outs are weeded out.

The second piece is declining headroom, or available space on the existing transmission grid. So ideally, market price signals incentivize savvy developers to build where it’s most beneficial to the market. But a lack of proactive transmission build-out historically means that available space on the existing system is in decline, which makes it even more difficult for developers to find good locations on the grid. And when they do find good locations, it’s even costlier to connect because it’s more constrained than before. So this has led to a lot of speculative projects getting put in the queues, because that’s the only way for them to find out what these potential really high costs at any location would be.

And finally, the third piece is the duration of time these projects are actually spending in queues trying to achieve the agreement. And then on top of that, post agreement, experiencing additional construction delays. So the bottom line, there is this gap between what we are hoping or thinking about building, and what actually gets built. And in order to improve that, we first need to build more of the right kinds of transmission to get power from where it’s generated to where people need it. And second, improve these queue processes to make the best use of the existing system that we have, via leveraging advanced technologies and software, and reduce time spent within the queue itself.

Stone: Well, as you just mentioned, there’s this rush of new projects. But the grid is basically what it has been for quite some time. So there are a limited number of areas where these new projects can actually connect to the grid without triggering necessary upgrades to the grid to handle that power from those new projects. Is that right?

Kotwis: That’s correct. Yeah. So that’s about trying to understand, okay. If you did want to connect here and this location is already full, what would you have to invest in the grid in order to make it safe for this project to push power onto the grid at this particular location? And that’s the theory behind the invest-and-connect strategy that happens in most of the US.

Stone: You also mentioned speculative interconnection requests, and you mentioned that the actual success rate, again, getting through the queue, is low. So those two are connected, right? So if I am a company that wants to build new generation, is the speculation, then, that I propose projects at several areas on the grid, hoping that I don’t get stuck with the upgrade costs for the grid to connect my resources, and eventually I just go ahead and connect where those upgrade costs are going to be relatively low?

Kotwis: Yeah, that’s the thinking. Yeah. And unfortunately, that’s the behavior that we’re seeing. But it is just rational market actors trying to make the best of a difficult situation, right? So it never used to be this way, that it took so long and it was so costly. And really, the only way to get a certain price discovery is to go through the queue process itself. And so that has compounded the issue, which is that now we have so many backlogged projects trying to get studied. And some of those— not all of them, but some of them— surely are speculative. And it results from this lack of available data on, where is the best location to connect to the queue? That’s hard to find, and also declining over time.

Stone: You mentioned the long wait time once you’re into the queue. And that obviously has to be a turn-off for project developers as well. How long are those wait times?

Kotwis: Yeah. Another good stat from LBNL is that pre-2008, it took less than two years to connect to the grid. But recently, this has grown to more than five years, and seven-plus years in some places. Now that’s a huge time delay, during which a lot can change. So there’s two distinct processes within that request to operation. Or I think previously, you called it “proposal to production.”

So within that, there’s two main pieces. First, the request to agreement piece. So that’s where in invest and connect in regions in the US, those queued projects are studied in power flow models, and you identify the necessary reinforcements, if needed. And then the second piece is from agreement to commercial operation. So now they’ve had an agreement— and maybe we’ll come back to this later— but they have an agreement, and there’s still additional project hurdles to face once you have a connection agreement. You still have to go through permitting and procurement and all that sort of stuff.

In terms of how long it’s been taking, there’s some data transparency and completeness issues here. Because a lot of times, the signed agreement date isn’t listed or is overwritten in publicly- available data sets. So for example, for projects that entered PJM’s queue during 2014 through 2018, we can see in the data that there are some of those projects still in the engineering and procurement phase or under construction,

Stone: But these are projects that go back seven years or so? That are still—

Kotwis: Yeah, or more. Yeah, but we don’t know how long ago their agreements were signed. And then if you fast forward a little bit, some projects in PJM’s— they’re calling it “the expedited process,” that entered the queue between 2018 and 2020— so that’s five to seven years ago now— they just received interconnection agreements in April of this year. Five to seven years later. And so that’s a really long time to languish in the queue. And you don’t really know, are you even going to get an agreement out of this? You can’t start your permitting or procurement processes until you know. You can’t order equipment until you think you can connect to the grid.

Stone: So we’ve got two areas of delay. We’ve got the interconnection process, which is amazing. Seven years, some of these projects have been waiting in the queue just to get their interconnection agreement. And then additional delays, which we’ll talk about later, after that queue. Downstream from that queue. Just interesting, the costs of staying in the queue, there must be some cost to that as well. I mean, if somebody has entered to queue in 2018, this cost for maintaining that, I would suppose all this time. Too, the world in 2018 looked very different than the world that we’re seeing today. And AI wasn’t even in discussion seven years ago. Are the projects that entered the queue seven years ago, are they even relevant today?

Kotwis: Yeah. It’s an interesting question. I mean, I would say that they’re definitely relevant because we haven’t been adding enough new energy resources over the last few years. And we can see the negative consequences of that in the price spikes in the capacity market and energy market. That’s a part of a functioning electricity market, is the ability of new market entrants to be competitive and increase competition in the market and try to get prices to come down. So we really do need additional resources, and the load is another piece. It’s another piece adding to the urgency, that we need that for resource adequacy as well, not just to ensure competitive market prices.

Stone: Well, it’s interesting. So we have all these resources that are coming through, and I just want to bring this into the very current context. We’re still waiting to see what Congress does with the budget bill, which it’s working through. Again, this is the end of June right now. A couple episodes ago on this podcast, or maybe it was last episode, we looked at the House bill and what its impact may be on the pace of clean energy development going forward. And one of the things that came out of that conversation was, due to the House’s proposed end of 2028 in- service requirements for new resources to receive IRA tax credits, we may actually see an acceleration of clean energy projects over the next three years as those projects try to get in before that deadline expires. So what we could potentially see is we have pressures of so many resources trying to get through the queue, and the processes downstream of that. That sounds like that could potentially intensify. Would that clog up the system even more?

Kotwis: This is my understanding of the current situation, is not only does the House version have this in-service by end of 2028, but it also includes a two-month deadline for projects to start construction after IRA guidance is finalized. Now the Senate version doesn’t include those deadlines, and I can’t speculate on what’s going to happen with the bill. But, you know, we just spoke about how projects have been waiting many years to potentially receive an interconnection agreement. To suddenly have an expectation of immediate construction isn’t very realistic.

That being said, of course they’re likely going to try to do as much as they can to get these projects constructed. I mean, that’s in everyone’s best interest. That’s in the developer’s best interest, the grid’s best interest, consumers’ best interests. But many factors contribute to whether a prospective project pencils financially and can access the necessary permits and equipment needed to be constructed. So those are all open questions. And yeah, I’m not sure if that necessarily will result in an acceleration, or if it won’t accelerate anything, and actually cause things to be much more chaotic.

Stone: So the grid operators and the regulators are quite aware of this interconnection backlog issue that we’ve been talking about. And PJM, which you introduced a few minutes ago, reformed its interconnection process in 2022. And FERC, the grid regulator, issued Order 2023 the following year with very similar reforms. What are the key elements of these reforms? Tell us about that.

Kotwis: PJM did initially develop a stakeholder process and identified some interconnection and reforms in the 2020-to-2022 time period. And those reforms were submitted to FERC, approved by FERC in 2022. And so they have been, since then, dutifully working on implementing those. What’s happening since Order 2023 is they’re trying to largely build those 2022 reforms as sufficient.

Now there are some things that those two have in common. For example, the transition from a first-come, first-served serial approach to a first-ready first-served cluster approach. So that’s common to both the 2022 and Order 2023 reforms. But it remains to be seen how this plays out. The first cycle implementing this approach in PJM is still being studied. They are ongoing in that process.

Stone: Could you tell us more about, what is that first-come, first-served approach that is being replaced by this new first-ready, first-served approach? What does that exactly mean?

Kotwis: The first-come, first-serve approach is more like a one-at-a-time thing, no matter who has gotten into the queue. Just like how you line up at a grocery store to check out. You are first in line, you get served first, right? So that’s that serial, one-at-a-time project approach. So the thinking was that that isn’t necessarily the most efficient way to go about studying projects when there’s such a huge backlog. That’s how it was done before we had this huge backlog. Now, with the huge backlog, maybe we could garner some efficiency if actually we studied projects together in a group of projects based on how ready they are to move forward, rather than just the project that’s first in line. It’s kind of like, akin to, “Well, everyone who has their pocketbook out, ready, you come first. And we’ll study you first and see you through.”

And so to implement that, for example, there’s new readiness requirements and study deposit requirements. That’s the other piece that both of these have in common. These are financial deposits that scale with project size, though the specific value may differ depending on if you’re talking about PJM or Order 2023. These are trying to make sure that the projects coming through the queue and actually being studied— it takes a lot of time and engineering effort to study these projects. It tries to make sure that those projects are ready to get built and more likely to be successful.

Stone: Again, PJM introduced its interconnection reform in 2022. FERC introduced its own in 2023. Again, I want to get to that issue. Are they basically the same reforms?

Kotwis: There are definitely some differences. So one of the differences in FERC Order 2023, it requires a 150-day maximum cluster study duration. PJM’s is longer. Order 2023 also imposes study delay penalties. PJM wants to use reasonable efforts and not impose penalties.

Stone: Is that a result of the stakeholder process in PJM, in which many of the companies that have skin in this game would not want to be subject to any kind of penalties?

Kotwis: I’m not sure about you know, their intention behind it. All I know is, comparing what they’ve written in their Order 2023 compliance filing submission versus what is being asked for in the order. So, yeah, they are largely trying to bill their 2022 reforms as sufficient. But in many ways, those are different than what is in Order 2023. So the duration of cluster studies is one. Study delay penalties is another. Using customer-provided information regarding how battery energy storage resources operate, and aligning the operation assumptions with how they’re studied in the model to ensure that they’re studied in a manner commensurate with how they’ll operate in reality. This is not something that PJM has wanted to comply with in their compliance filing.

And then finally, requiring an evaluation of alternative transmission technologies. That’s also required by Order 2023. And this is an even trickier piece, where PJM says they already do this, although it’s unclear to what extent and how this happens. You know, I haven’t seen grid- enhancing technologies discussed or recommended in any recent study report that PJM has published. And, you know, in comparison, in our Getting Interconnected, a PJM report from 2024, we found that more than 1500 megawatts of queued projects in Pennsylvania could connect more quickly and cheaply with grid-enhancing technologies. But right now, only 450 megawatts remain in the last study phase of transition cycle one. So, what happened? Were GETs considered? How rigorous was the study? We have no real way of knowing. And the problem is, there’s a lot of potential customer savings being left on the table if they were applicable and weren’t studied to be found to be applicable.

So we actually conducted that study across five states in PJM and dumped the results into an economic model of the future system, and found that as early as 2027, consumers could start seeing $1 billion in annual energy market savings. But it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. And it doesn’t look like grid-enhancing technologies have been chosen, and we don’t really know why.

Stone: Well, what are the grid-enhancing technologies that you’re talking about here that would accelerate this process? Give us a little overview.

Kotwis: Yeah. So there’s three primary grid-enhancing technologies. The first is dynamic line ratings. The second is advanced power flow controllers, and the third is topology optimization. And these aren’t exactly the same as those identified in Order 2023. But Order 2023 does identify some of those. And those are the three that we studied in our report, because they’re comparatively, compared to reconducting a line or rebuilding an entirely new transmission line, they’re very cost effective, very cheap, and they are also modular. They could be moved from one place to another. And they can be deployed very quickly, on the order of months, instead of the years that it takes to reconduct or rebuild transmission lines. So in this way, we could leverage these like cheap, low-cost technologies to make the most out of the existing grid that we have even as it nears capacity, because these devices help make our use of the transmission system more efficient.

Stone: So basically, what you’re saying here is that, again, with the grid that we have right now, more new resources could come onto the grid without having to invest in the more expensive new lines of reconductoring, because these grid-enhancing technologies could make the most of the grid that we have right now.

Kotwis: Yeah, exactly.

Stone: So it’s interesting, you said that PJM does not require these in its reforms, but FERC does, if I understood that correctly.

Kotwis: Yeah. So PJM says that they already do this. But again, it’s unclear to what extent and how that happens. And the result being, we aren’t seeing them being offered in the interconnection studies as network upgrades. And so I would love to know more about why that is. You know, these aren’t applicable everywhere. But we found that they were applicable in some places. And so would love to know more about what the discrepancy is there, because Order 2023 is really trying to make sure we’re using flexible and readily-available technologies to get the most out of the transmission system. So you know, we have to see whether we’re doing that.

Stone: To make sure, also, I understand this. If FERC is saying that it’s a requirement that you at least consider these grid-enhancing technologies, wouldn’t PJM ultimately be required to do the same? Because ultimately it would have to comply, I would believe, not only with its own reforms, but with the 2023 reforms from FERC.

Kotwis: What can happen is that PJM and any RTO or any any FERC jurisdictional entity can request an independent entity variation. So it’s called an independent entity variation, and it basically means that, for whatever reason— there are the unique particulars of how they operate their system, and their system— they think that this shouldn’t apply to them. So that’s one of the ways that they could say, “Well, this doesn’t really apply to us.”

Stone: Okay, so these reforms have been out for a couple of years at least. What results are we seeing from them so far? Are they starting to make a dent in the backlog or timelines in the interconnection queue?

Kotwis: There’s a good Interconnection.FYI blog on this subject that came out recently. And for the first time in years, queue backlogs almost nationwide have decreased in size rather than increased, the one exception being the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO. So far, PJM’s transition cycle one and transition cycle two, which are the first cycles that they’re applying their 2022 reforms, they have proceeded faster than their prior serial processes. So this increased speed will go a long way in helping. And using automation and software-based automation to speed up study processes still hasn’t been implemented in a variety of regions, but could also help to speed things even further. PJM has announced that they’re considering doing something like that in collaboration with Tapestry. So that’s really exciting. And it remains to be seen when and how that’s implemented, but there could be a lot of further improvement based on that going forward.

Going back to the original three reasons that commercial operation success rates are so low, speed is one of those aspects. But the other remains the lack of transmission. So Order 2023, that’s going back to this requirement of the consideration of transmission technologies that help make the most efficient use of the existing grid that we have. So this is one of those reforms that still holds a lot of promise, even if we are able to crunch through the queue and problems more quickly.

Stone: Well, I want to bring up another electricity market, which is ERCOT, which is the grid operator in the market for the majority of the state of Texas. And they’re a bit of an outlier in that they have been quite successful in getting new capacity online relatively quickly. And this ties into what is known as their energy-only market model. Can you explain that model and how ERCOT has managed to get resources onto the grid a little bit faster?

Kotwis: Yeah. ERCOT is unique in a couple of respects. ERCOT stands for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and so ERCOT is not subject to FERC jurisdiction. They don’t have a capacity market, and they leverage what’s called the connect-and-manage interconnection approach. So under connect-and-manage prospective, new generators are allowed to connect to the existing transmission system expeditiously, with the understanding that the grid operator will curtail them or limit their output even if they’re available of producing output, depending on the local transmission grid needs and congestion levels. On a quarterly basis, the grid operator will review the performance of the entire transmission system to identify the most optimal upgrades and then take action on those.

Conversely, the rest of the US operates under this invest-and-connect paradigm, where the prospective new generators must first be studied in a power flow model to assess whether the current grid can handle the additions. And if not, they’ll identify the necessary reinforcements. So those reinforcements are called network upgrades, and the prospective generator has to pay to build those, thereby investing in the grid. That’s where “invest” comes from in invest-and- connect, prior to be being allowed to connect. So in return, the developer earns the ability to participate in the capacity market.

Now, ERCOT doesn’t have a capacity market. As you said, they’re an energy-only model, so they can do things differently. And to be clear, there are pros and cons to each approach. And it’s not necessarily a binary, although current markets make it out to be. For example, energy prices in ERCOT can be more volatile than in other regions because it’s the only price signal available to incentivize new entry. Other than its ancillary service market, but that’s a discussion for another time.

But on the other hand, the pro to that is that they can bring new resources online very quickly and expeditiously, and so that’s helping them sail through these heat waves that we’re seeing, even with low prices. So on the other hand, in invest-and-connect regions, FERC stipulated in Order 2003— not to be confused with Order 2023— that there should be an option for developers, even in invest-and-connect regions, to request energy-only service, rather than network-to-resource service, which theoretically would offer quicker and cheaper interconnection to the existing system, subject to curtailment. This rings and sounds kind of a little bit similar to this energy-only-with-curtailment model that ERCOT is going for.

However, each region was given deference, through these independent entity variations that we previously talked about, in how it implemented this option. And in reality, in many cases, it’s just as costly and cumbersome to pursue as a network service. And so many developers choose to simply pursue network service given that they would additionally be allowed to count on earnings from the capacity market.

Stone: So to sum this one up, if I’m a new resource and I want to connect to the grid in ERCOT, which is the energy-only model, I connect, and I don’t necessarily have to engage in upgrading the grid in any way whatsoever. I just take it as it is and I connect my new resource. But there is, as you mentioned, the possibility of curtailment, which means that if it is a particular period where there is a lot of demand on the grid, the grid is under a lot of stress, and the energy from my generator is adding to that stress by putting more energy into the system, at a particular point, I may be shut off from the grid or asked to reduce my output so that I don’t destabilize the grid. And then, for that reason, I don’t enjoy the revenues that would have come from producing more energy at that time. So it sounds to me like the ERCOT example has worked. But if I am somebody who’s investing in these new resources, I do face that risk, that my revenue may be volatile in the future, because I may be curtailed once or multiple times at times of grid stress. Is that right?

Kotwis: Yeah, absolutely, that’s exactly right. And so it’s important to keep in mind that there’s trade offs to each approach, right? That is a long-term risk for projects. But in the near term, you know, they could connect really quickly. Whereas in the rest of the regions, you might have more financial certainty down the line, but you might not be able to connect for five to seven years, you know. And there’s a real discrepancy there.

Stone: And to get those capacity payments, like in PJM, which has a capacity market, it’s a companion market to the energy market that we’ve been talking about here. You have to prove yourself to be reliable, and your interconnection has to be reliable, before you can even connect to that grid. So that’s where that additional investment in buttressing the grid before you even connect comes in. But once you’re in, you are no longer subject to curtailment. Your revenues are going to be much more predictable after that point.

Kotwis: That’s true in theory.

Stone: Okay.

Kotwis: But in reality, what actually happens is the dispatch models that grid operators use to dispatch the grid does so on a cost-optimal basis. So whatever the generator is that is available to produce and is lowest cost will be dispatched first, regardless of whether they’ve paid to upgrade the network. That isn’t taken into account in existing economic dispatch models. And this is how we’re able to dispatch the grid and keep prices as low as possible, because we build from the ground up. What are the cheapest resources first, that can be deliverable, and then add on top of that.

So a lot of folks think that if they go for network resource interconnection service, then they won’t be curtailed. But that’s not necessarily the case. Curtailment happens based on whether your resource is cost-competitive at that time and can be delivered to load.

Stone: So let’s look at some of the solutions going forward. So again, we have this interconnection queue issue that we’ve been talking about, and some of the solutions to that. You already started to talk about grid-enhancing technologies. You also mentioned the importance of data transparency and key data about the grid that should be available to new project developers. How available is that data? How transparent is that data right now, and how would increased transparency potentially help to resolve these interconnection delays that we’ve been talking about?

Kotwis: As an organization, we’re doing research on what does the existing data tell us? And trying to make recommendations for improvements based on that. It’s really important to have access to high-quality, transparent data. Now, what we’re finding is that every region across the US implements their processes differently. They use different words and different keywords to talk about the same information, for example. Sometimes they’re updating their databases and they’re overwriting information that previously existed, and so that information is now lost. So there’s a lot of ways that the way that data practices are being handled right now results in a lot of holes and gaps in the data. And that prevents us from being able to really have a holistic picture of what’s happening.

So for example, like one thing that we would love to see is a simple data entry box that says, “Okay, which technologies were evaluated when trying to identify the appropriate network upgrade in this circumstance?” Well, that doesn’t exist. We don’t know what all was evaluated. It would be nice to see like, “Oh, we looked at dynamic line ratings. And those aren’t appropriate here for XYZ reason.” But that’s not something that we have access to.

Also, I mentioned the date at which interconnection agreements were signed. That’s really important to know, to really get an idea of how long projects are languishing in the queue. Now, we have some information for it, but it doesn’t cover 100% of the queue requesters, right? So just having more complete information that isn’t overwritten and can be compared across regions would really help us to gain a better understanding of not only how things are going, but how reforms are improving things.

Stone: It’s interesting as well, Department of Energy, in April of 2024, released a report that’s titled “The Transmission Interconnections Roadmap.” And it had some additional suggestions as well. Some issues such as surplus interconnection service, the energy-only interconnection that we’ve just talked about. And also something they refer to as market-based approaches to rationing interconnection access. What are these things, and what’s the potential behind them?

Kotwis: So I’ll focus on the SIS, because that piece, I think, is really important. And we’ve worked on it a little bit with PJM. We presented to PJM on this topic in the fall of last year. So what surplus interconnection service is, it’s enabled by a pre-existing FERC order, and it allows the full utilization of the capacity interconnection rights that are given to existing projects on the system. So for example, let’s say you have a natural gas plant and it operates a majority of the year, maybe 80% of the year. But that remaining 20% of the year, if it’s not operating during a time where some solar energy resources would be at full output, then you can use the surplus interconnection service avenue to add solar resources to that existing plant, and only up to the level of interconnection rights that have been given already to that existing gas plant.

Now, an even more beneficial use would be taking standalone wind and solar resources and adding batteries to them. That’s a really quick and cost-effective way to add capacity to the existing system. Right? So a solar plant that’s standalone will only use a certain portion of the interconnection rights that it’s been given. And adding a battery behind that point of interconnection to firm up that resource and store some energy when it’s not needed for the rest of the grid, and then sell that energy back to the grid when prices are high in order to reduce those prices—that’s another really beneficial way of extending the capacity contributions of existing resources in a really cost effective manner.

So this is a new thing in PJM. FERC recently approved their proposal to treat storage resources more appropriately when they’re being studied for surplus interconnection service, and hopefully we’ll see a lot more storage come online via that pathway in PJM,

Stone: You mentioned earlier that projects that do successfully get through the interconnection queue still face a number of hurdles, and I think those hurdles have become a little bit higher recently. They include siting and permitting, which are always kind of an issue, as well as supply chain issues that are impacting renewable energy at this point as well as natural gas projects. How big are these issues right now, especially the supply chain delays?

Kotwis: Beyond the queue, these additional hurdles that projects face— it’s primarily siting, permitting, and supply chain. So this siting piece, site selection is often led by transmission availability and market price signals, right? We talked about how ideally, the market can incentivize new entry in the right places. But because the limited transmission capacity is this big bottleneck, that means that the queue dictates the pace at which developers are able to proceed with these other pieces of the puzzle.

So as a reminder, the queue is still a big driving bottleneck, because it takes so long to get through it. And then once a project has gotten through it and they’ve obtained an interconnection agreement, there’s a lot of discretion in local permitting that increases uncertainty and often timelines for project construction. So this discretion at the local permitting level sometimes leaves decisions up to an individual’s personal judgment without clear guidelines. Just yesterday, actually, PJM published that these permitting delays caused more than 14 months of commercial operation delays on average.

We do think that predictable rule-based permitting systems could increase clarity and consistency through this process, and lower risks for projects going through it. But even once a permit is obtained, then supply chain constraints can add to the procurement dilemma. So having an interconnection agreement and permit gives developers the certainty to place an order on equipment. But COVID and more recent hurdles have strained supply chains, and especially high-voltage equipment has much longer lead times than before. So in PJM’s same presentation yesterday, transmission owner material procurement caused almost 20 months of delays. That’s a long time for just to be waiting on equipment that you’re purchasing.

Stone: So that’s like big transformers as well, right? That type of thing.

Kotwis: Exactly. Transformers are a really big piece of this puzzle. We need to increase the manufacturing of this critical high-voltage grid equipment. And transformers, especially. And it’s not only for new generation builds, but also to connect large loads. They also depend on transformers. And to help regions recover after damage due to natural disasters. You know, every time a big hurricane comes through, there’s sometimes hundreds of transformers that are down. And we really need to be manufacturing this really critical grid equipment to keep pace with everything that’s going on.

Stone: So let me ask you a final question here. And I guess this is kind of the takeaway of the conversation. We’ve talked about all these challenges with the interconnection queue, downstream with supply chains and permitting, et cetera. But we really need resources on the grid quickly right now. And it’s kind of a battle. We need the resources quickly, but we have these delays. What is your personal outlook on this? Do you think that these queue delays, the downstream delays in getting the projects actually under construction and built, do you think they will be resolved? And do you think we’re going to have enough resources coming on to the grid over the next few years to mollify our concerns about resource adequacy going forward?

Kotwis: It’s a big question. And I would say that we have to be realistic. This is a really tall task. We haven’t necessarily set ourselves up for success. But we can work to make the best of what we have. So we have both a lot of new resources trying to connect, and the enabling technology to get them connected. Study automation software, grid-enhancing technologies, high -temperature, low sag advanced conductors, advanced batteries, surplus interconnection service and power couples, all on the supply side. And then on the demand side, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, virtual power plants. All of these are low-cost tools in the toolbox that we can leverage here and now.

And if we focus on being an enabler of new generation and transmission, and implement more interconnection solutions than obstacles, consumers can reap the benefits of abundant, low cost, reliable energy.

Stone: So we have the tools. Hopefully, we’ll use them.

Kotwis: That’s right,

Stone: Sarah, thank you very much for talking.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-2212058134-aspect-ratio-1280-418-1-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 11:12:02.420197
